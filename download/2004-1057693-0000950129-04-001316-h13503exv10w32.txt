successor provision) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for insurance
by such Corporation of time deposits made in dollars at the offices of such
member in the United States; provided that if, as a result of any change in any
law, rule or regulation, it is no longer possible to determine the Assessment

product of:

             (i)   the Applicable BA Discount Rate (expressed as a decimal)
                   applicable to such Bankers' Acceptance; and

             (ii)  a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days

applicable Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive
and binding, absent manifest error) that it is unable to ascertain the Federal
Funds Rate for any reason, including, without limitation, the inability or

hereof, the Base Rate shall, until the circumstances giving rise to such
inability no longer exist, be calculated without regard to that particular

percentage as U.S. Agent may approve in writing for any particular account
debtor), (j) each of the representations and warranties set forth in the
Security Documents executed by the applicable Person with respect thereto is
true and correct in all material respects on such date and (k) acting reasonably
and in good faith and after consultation with the applicable Borrower, U.S.
Agent has not deemed such Account ineligible because of uncertainty about the
creditworthiness of the account debtor or because U.S. Agent otherwise
reasonably considers the collateral value thereof to be impaired or its ability
to realize such value to be insecure. Amounts payable to any account debtor
shall be netted out of Eligible Accounts owing by such account debtor. In the
event of any dispute under the foregoing criteria, about whether an Account is
or has ceased to be an Eligible Account, the reasonable decision of U.S. Agent,
made in good faith, shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error.

United States of America or Canada (as to Canadian Borrower or any Subsidiary of
Canadian Borrower) or in the United States of America or the United Kingdom or
such other jurisdictions as U.K. Agent may from time to time approve (as to U.K.
Borrower or any Subsidiary of U.K. Borrower); (b) it is in good condition, meets
all standards imposed by any Governmental Authority having regulatory authority

shall have notified, in a manner that effectively under applicable law creates
a valid and first priority Lien in favor of the applicable Agent in such
Inventory, such warehouseman, bailee, agent, processor or customer of the
applicable Agent's Lien and (ii) such warehouseman, bailee, agent, processor or
customer has subordinated any Lien it may claim therein and agreed to hold all
such Inventory during the continuance of an Event of Default for the applicable
Agent's account subject to the applicable Agent's instructions, (d) any such
category of Inventory consisting of finished goods shall not have remained
unsold for more than one (1) year (or such longer period as U.S. Agent may
approve in writing for any particular goods), (e) each of the representations
and warranties set forth in the Security Documents executed by the applicable
Person with respect thereto is true and correct in all material respects on such
date and (f) acting reasonably and in good faith and after consultation with the
applicable Borrower, U.S. Agent has not deemed such Inventory ineligible because
U.S. Agent reasonably considers the collateral value thereof to be impaired or
its ability to realize such value to be insecure. In the event of any dispute

ceased to be Eligible Inventory, the reasonable decision of U.S. Agent, made in
good faith, shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error.

by the Canadian Lenders in connection with a particular borrowing shall be equal
to the lesser of (i) the unutilized portion
<PAGE>
of the Canadian Commitments or (ii) $500,000 or any integral multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof (if the Loans are denominated in Dollars) or

Loan repaid prior to the Termination Date may be reborrowed pursuant to the

excess thereof.

        (d)  Bankers' Acceptances. From time to time on or after the Effective
Date and during the Availability Period, each Canadian Lender shall accept and
purchase Bankers' Acceptances drawn on it under Section 2.3 hereof by Canadian
Borrower in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding (including

reasonably satisfied that such currency is readily available in the required
amounts and that such currency selection is not otherwise disadvantageous to any
Agent or any Lender. Upon the date of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the
applicable Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto,
to have sold to each U.S. Lender, Canadian Lender or U.K. Lender, as the case

Credit shall, at the option of Canadian Borrower, be denominated in either
Dollars or Canadian Dollars. Fees due in respect of a U.S. Letter of Credit or a
U.K. Letter of Credit shall be payable in Dollars and fees due in respect of a
Canadian Letter of Credit shall be payable (i) in Dollars, if such Letter of
Credit is denominated in Dollars and (ii) in Canadian Dollars if such Letter of
Credit is denominated in Canadian Dollars or any other currency.

        (b)  Additional Provisions. The following additional provisions shall
apply to each Letter of Credit:

             (i)  U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower or U.K. Borrower, as the case
        may be, shall give the appropriate Agent notice requesting each issuance
        of a Letter of Credit hereunder as provided in Section 4.3 hereof and
        shall furnish such additional information regarding such transaction as
        such Agent may reasonably request. Upon receipt of such notice, such
        Agent shall promptly notify each U.S. Lender, Canadian Lender or U.K.
        Lender, as the case may be, of the contents thereof and of such Lender's
        Commitment Percentage of the amount of such proposed Letter of Credit.

             (ii) No U.S. Letter of Credit may be issued if after giving effect
        thereto the sum of (A) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
        U.S. Revolving Loans plus (B) the aggregate Letter of Credit Liabilities
        relating to U.S. Letters of Credit would exceed the Maximum U.S.
        Available Amount. No Canadian Letter of Credit may be issued if after
        giving effect thereto the sum of (A) the aggregate outstanding principal
        amount of Canadian Revolving Loans plus (B) the aggregate Letter of
        Credit Liabilities relating to Canadian Letters of Credit plus (C) the
        aggregate Bankers' Acceptance Liabilities would exceed the Maximum
        Canadian Available Amount. No U.K. Letter of Credit may be issued if
        after giving effect thereto the sum of (A) the aggregate outstanding
        principal amount of U.K. Revolving Loans plus (B) the aggregate Letter
        of Credit Liabilities relating to U.K. Letters of Credit would exceed
        the Maximum U.K. Available Amount. On each day during the period
        commencing with the issuance of any Letter of Credit and until such
        Letter of Credit shall have expired or been terminated, the U. S.
        Commitment, Canadian Commitment or U.K. Commitment, as the case may be,
        of each applicable Lender shall be deemed to be utilized for all
        purposes hereof, including Section 2.5(a), in an amount equal to such
        Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount then available for drawings
        under such Letter of Credit (or any unreimbursed drawings under such
        Letter of Credit).

             (iii) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of
        any demand for payment thereunder, the applicable Issuer shall notify
        the Agents and thereafter the U.S. Agent, the Canadian Agent or the U.K.
        Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower
        and each applicable Lender as to the amount to be paid as a result of
        such demand and the payment date therefor. If at any time prior to the
        earlier of the expiration date of a Letter of Credit or the Termination
        Date any applicable Issuer shall have made a payment to a beneficiary of
        a Letter of Credit in respect of a drawing
<PAGE>
        under such Letter of Credit, each applicable Lender will pay to the
        U.S. Agent, the Canadian Agent or the U.K. Agent, as the case may be,
        immediately upon demand by such Issuer at any time during the period
        commencing after such payment until reimbursement thereof in full by the
        applicable Borrower, an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment
        Percentage of such payment, together with interest on such amount for
        each day from the date of demand for such payment (or, if such demand is
        made after 11:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time (in the case of a U.S. Letter
        of Credit) or 12:00 noon Toronto, Ontario time (in the case of a
        Canadian Letter of Credit) or 11:00 a.m. London, United Kingdom time (in
        the case of a U.K. Letter of Credit) on such date, from the next
        succeeding Business Day) to the date of payment by such Lender of such
        amount at a rate of interest per annum equal to (i) in respect of U.S.
        Letters of Credit or U.K. Letters of Credit, the Federal Funds Rate,
        (ii) in respect of Canadian Letters of Credit which are denominated in
        Dollars, the Base Rate plus two percent (2%) and (iii) in respect of
        Canadian Letters of Credit which are denominated in Canadian Dollars,
        the Canadian Prime Rate plus two percent (2%). To the extent that it is
        ultimately determined that the applicable Borrower is relieved of its
        obligation to reimburse the applicable Issuer because of such Issuer's
        gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining that documents
        received under any applicable Letter of Credit comply with the terms
        thereof, the applicable Issuer shall be obligated to refund to the
        paying Lenders all amounts paid to such Issuer to reimburse Issuer for
        the applicable drawing under such Letter of Credit, together with
        interest from the date of payment by such Lender to the date of
        repayment by the Issuing Bank at the interest rates set forth above
        applicable to such Lenders.

             (iv) U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or U.K. Borrower, as the
        case may be, shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated
        forthwith to reimburse the appropriate Agent, on the date on which such
        Agent notifies U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or U.K. Borrower, as
        the case may be, of the date and amount of any payment by the applicable
        Issuer of any drawing or payment made under a Letter of Credit, for the
        amount paid by such Issuer upon such drawing or payment, without
        presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of
        which are hereby waived. Such reimbursement may, subject to satisfaction
        of the conditions in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof, the limitations on
        size contained in Section 2.1 and to the Maximum U.S. Available Amount,
        Maximum Canadian Available Amount or Maximum U.K. Available Amount, as
        the case may be (after adjustment in the same to reflect the elimination
        of the corresponding Letter of Credit Liability), be made by the
        borrowing of Loans or, in the case of the Canadian Borrower, by the
        issuance, acceptance and purchase of Bankers' Acceptances. The
        applicable Agent will pay to each Lender such Lender's Commitment
        Percentage of all amounts received from U.S. Borrower, the Canadian
        Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, for application in
        payment, in whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect
        of any Letter of Credit, but only to the extent such Lender has made
        payment to the applicable Agent in respect of such Letter of Credit
        pursuant to clause (iii) above. To the extent such applicable Agent does
        not pay such Lender within the timeframes which are applicable to such
        Lenders in clause (iii) above, such applicable Agent shall pay interest
        to such Lenders at the interest rates set forth in clause (iii) above
        applicable to such Lenders for such period of delay.
<PAGE>
             (v)  U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as
        the case may be, will pay to the appropriate Agent at the Principal
        Office of such Agent for the account of each applicable Lender a letter
        of credit fee with respect to each Letter of Credit equal to the greater
        of (x) $500 or (y) the Margin Percentage then in effect with respect to
        LIBOR Borrowings multiplied by the daily average amount available for
        drawings under each Letter of Credit (and computed on the basis of the
        actual number of days elapsed in a year composed of 360 days), in each
        case for the period from and including the date of issuance of such
        Letter of Credit to and including the date of expiration or termination
        thereof, such fee to be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each
        three (3) month anniversary of the issuance of the applicable Letter of
        Credit and upon expiration or termination of the applicable Letter of
        Credit. The applicable Agent will pay to each applicable Lender,
        promptly after receiving any payment in respect of letter of credit fees
        referred to in this clause (v), an amount equal to the product of such
        Lender's Commitment Percentage times the amount of such fees. In
        addition to and cumulative of the above described fees, U.S. Borrower,
        the Canadian Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, shall
        pay to the appropriate Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuer,
        in advance on the date of the issuance of the applicable Letter of
        Credit, a fronting fee in an amount equal to the greater of (x) $500 or
        (y) 1/8% of the face amount of the applicable Letter of Credit (such
        fronting fee to be retained by the applicable Issuer for its own
        account).

             (vi) The issuance by the applicable Issuer of each Letter of Credit
        shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5
        hereof, be subject to the conditions precedent (A) that such Letter of
        Credit shall be in such form and contain such terms as shall be
        reasonably satisfactory to applicable Agent, and (B) that U.S. Borrower,
        the Canadian Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, shall
        have executed and delivered such Applications and other instruments and
        agreements relating to such Letter of Credit as the applicable Agent
        shall have reasonably requested and are not inconsistent with the terms
        of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this
        Agreement and the terms of any Application, the terms hereof shall
        control.

             (vii) Each Issuer will send to U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower
        or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, and each applicable Lender,
        immediately upon issuance of any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuer
        or any amendment thereto, a true and correct copy of such Letter of
        Credit or amendment.

        (c)  Indemnification; Release. U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or
the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, hereby indemnifies and holds harmless
each Agent, each Lender and each Issuer from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Agent, such Lender or
such Issuer may incur (or which may be claimed against such Agent, such Lender
or such Issuer by any Person whatsoever), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE
OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, in connection
with the execution and delivery of any Letter of Credit or transfer of or
payment or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit; provided that U.S.
Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, shall
not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any party seeking indemnification
for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent,
but only to the extent, caused by (i)
<PAGE>
the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the party seeking
indemnification or exoneration, or (ii) the failure by the party seeking
indemnification to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it
of a request required to be paid under applicable law. U.S. Borrower, the
Canadian Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, hereby releases,
waives and discharges each Agent, each Lender and each Issuer from any claims,
causes of action, damages, losses, liabilities, reasonable costs or expenses
which may now exist or may hereafter arise, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, by reason
of or in connection with the failure of any Agent, any Issuer or any other
Lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to such Agent, such Lender or
such Issuer, as the case may be, hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall
affect any rights U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as
the case may be, may have against such defaulting party or may have in respect
of gross negligence or willful misconduct). Nothing in this Section 2.2(c) is
intended to limit the obligations of U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or the
U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, under any other provision of this Agreement.

        (d) Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. Subject to
Sections 11.7 and 11.17 hereof, if as a result of any Regulatory Change there
shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any tax (other than any tax
based on or measured by net income), reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of
Credit issued or to be issued hereunder or participations in such Letters of
Credit, and the result shall be to increase the cost to any Lender of issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or any participation therein, or materially
reduce any amount receivable by any Lender hereunder in respect of any Letter of
Credit or any participation therein (which increase in cost, or reduction in
amount receivable, shall be the result of such Lender's reasonable allocation of
the aggregate of such increases or reductions resulting from such event), then
such Lender shall notify U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or the U.K.
Borrower, as the case may be, through the appropriate Agent (which notice shall
be accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
the determination of the amount due), and within 15 Business Days after demand
therefor by such Lender through such Agent, U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower
or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, shall pay to such Lender, from time to
time as specified by such Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient
to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount. Such
statement as to such increased costs or reductions in amount incurred by such
Lender, submitted by such Lender to U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or the
U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to the amount thereof,
absent manifest error, and may be computed using any reasonable averaging and
attribution method. Each Lender will notify U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower
or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, through the appropriate Agent of any
event occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Lender
to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.2(d) as promptly as practicable after
any executive officer of such Lender obtains knowledge thereof and determines to
request such compensation, and (if so requested by U.S. Borrower, the Canadian
Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, through the appropriate
Agent) will designate a different lending office of such Lender for the issuance
or maintenance of Letters of Credit by such Lender or will take such other
action as U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or the U.K. Borrower, as the case
may be, may reasonably request if such designation or action is consistent with
the internal policy of such Lender and legal and regulatory restrictions, can be
undertaken at no additional cost, will avoid the need for, or reduce the
<PAGE>
amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such
Lender, be disadvantageous to such Lender (provided that no such U.S. Lender
shall have any obligation so to designate a different lending office which is
not located in the United States of America, no such Canadian Lender shall have
any obligation so to designate a different lending office which is not located
in Canada and no such U.K. Lender shall have any obligation so to designate a
different lending office which is not located in the United Kingdom).

        2.3  Certain Provisions Relating to Bankers' Acceptances.

        (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Canadian Lender
severally agrees to accept and purchase Bankers' Acceptances drawn upon it by
the Canadian Borrower denominated in Canadian Dollars. The Canadian Borrower
shall notify the Canadian Agent by irrevocable written notice (each a "Bankers'
Acceptance Notice") by 12:00 noon (Toronto, Ontario time) two (2) Business Days
prior to the proposed date of any borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances. Each
borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances shall be in a minimum aggregate face
amount of C$1,000,000.00 and integral multiples of C$100,000.00 in excess
thereof. The face amount of each Bankers' Acceptance shall be C$100,000.00 or
any integral multiple thereof. Each Bankers' Acceptance Notice shall be in the
form of Exhibit G.

             (1)  Bankers' Acceptances shall be issued and shall mature on a
        Business Day. Each Bankers' Acceptance shall have a term of
        approximately 1, 2 or 3 months or, if available, 6 months excluding days
        of grace and shall mature on a Business Day on or before the Revolving
        Loan Maturity Date and shall be in form and substance reasonably
        satisfactory to each Canadian Lender.

             (2)  Subject to Section 2.3(a)(3), Bankers' Acceptances shall be
        signed by duly authorized officers of the Canadian Borrower or, in the
        alternative, the signatures of such officers may be mechanically
        reproduced in facsimile thereon and Bankers' Acceptances bearing such
        facsimile signatures shall be binding on the Canadian Borrower as if
        they had been manually executed and delivered by such officers on behalf
        of the Canadian Borrower; notwithstanding that any person whose manual
        or facsimile signature appears on any Bankers' Acceptance may no longer
        be an authorized signatory for the Canadian Borrower on the date of
        issuance of a Bankers' Acceptance, such signature shall nevertheless be
        valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had remained
        in force at the time of such issuance and any such Bankers' Acceptance
        shall be binding on the Canadian Borrower;

             (3)  In lieu of the Canadian Borrower signing Bankers' Acceptances
        in accordance with Section 2.3(a)(2) and, for so long as the power of
        attorney in Section 2.3(a)(5) is in force with respect to a given
        Canadian Lender, such Canadian Lender shall execute and deliver Bankers'
        Acceptances on behalf of the Canadian Borrower in accordance with the
        provisions thereof and, for certainty, all references herein to drafts
        drawn by the Canadian Borrower, Bankers' Acceptances executed by the
        Canadian Borrower or similar expressions shall be deemed to include
        Bankers' Acceptances executed in accordance with a power of attorney,
        unless the context otherwise requires;
<PAGE>
             (4)  If and for so long as the power of attorney referred to in
        Section 2.3(a)(5) is in force with respect to each of the Canadian
        Lenders, it is intended that pursuant to the DBNA, all Bankers'
        Acceptances accepted by the Canadian Lenders under this Agreement will
        be issued in the form of a "depository bill" (as defined in the DBNA),
        deposited with a "clearing house" (as defined in the DBNA including The
        Canadian Depository for Securities Ltd. or its nominee CDS & Co.). In
        order to give effect to the foregoing, the Canadian Agent will, subject
        to the approval of the Canadian Borrower and the Canadian Lenders,
        establish and notify the Canadian Borrower and the Canadian Lenders of
        any additional procedures, consistent with the terms of this Agreement
        and the DBNA, as are reasonably necessary to accomplish such intention,
        including:

              (i) any instrument held by the Canadian Lenders for the purposes
                  of Bankers' Acceptances will have marked prominently and
                  legibly on its face and within its text, at or before the time
                  of issue, the words "This is a depository bill subject to the
                  Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada)";

             (ii) any reference to the authentication of the Bankers' Acceptance
                  will be removed; and

            (iii) any reference to the "bearer" will be removed and such
                  Bankers' Acceptances will not be marked with any words
                  prohibiting negotiation, transfer or assignment of it or of an
                  interest in it.

             (5)  To facilitate the issuance and acceptance of Bankers'
        Acceptances under this Agreement, the Canadian Borrower hereby appoints
        each Canadian Lender, acting by any authorized signatory of such Lender,
        as its attorney to:

              (i) to sign for and on behalf and in the name of the Canadian
                  Borrower as drawer, drafts in such Canadian Lender's standard
                  form which are depository bills as defined in the DBNA,
                  payable to a "clearing house" (as defined in the DBNA)
                  including, without limitation, The Canadian Depository For
                  Securities Limited or its nominee, CDS & Co. (the "clearing
                  house");

             (ii) for drafts which are not depository bills, to sign for and on
                  behalf and in the name of the Canadian Borrower as drawer and
                  to endorse on its behalf, Bankers' Acceptances drawn on the
                  Canadian Lender payable to the order of the undersigned or
                  payable to the order of such Canadian Lender;

            (iii) to fill in the amount, date and maturity date of such
                  Bankers' Acceptances; and

             (iv) to deposit and/or deliver such Bankers' Acceptances which have
                  been accepted by such Canadian Lender,

        provided that such acts in each case are to be undertaken by the
        Canadian Lender in question strictly in accordance with instructions
        given to such Canadian Lender by the Canadian Borrower as provided in
        this Section. For certainty, signatures of any
<PAGE>
        authorized signatory of a Canadian Lender may be mechanically
        reproduced in facsimile on Bankers' Acceptances in accordance herewith
        and such facsimile signatures shall be binding and effective as if they
        had been manually executed by such authorized signatory of such Canadian
        Lender. The communication in writing by the Canadian Borrower, or on
        behalf of the Canadian Borrower by the Canadian Agent, to the Canadian
        Lender of the instructions set out in the Bankers' Acceptance Notice
        shall constitute (a) the authorization and instruction of the Canadian
        Borrower to the Canadian Lender to sign for and on behalf and in the
        name of the Canadian Borrower as drawer the requested Bankers'
        Acceptances and to complete and/or endorse Bankers' Acceptances in
        accordance with such information as set out above and (b) the request of
        the Canadian Borrower to the Canadian Lender to accept such Bankers'
        Acceptances and deposit the same with the clearing house or deliver the
        same, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with this Agreement
        and such instructions. The Canadian Borrower acknowledges that a
        Canadian Lender shall not be obligated to accept any such Bankers'
        Acceptances except in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
        A Canadian Lender shall be and it is hereby authorized to act on behalf
        of the Canadian Borrower upon and in compliance with instructions
        communicated to that Canadian Lender as provided herein if the Canadian
        Lender reasonably believes such instructions to be genuine. If a
        Canadian Lender accepts Bankers' Acceptances pursuant to any such
        instructions, that Canadian Lender shall confirm particulars of such
        instructions and advise the Canadian Agent that it has complied
        therewith by notice in writing addressed to the Canadian Agent and
        served personally or sent by telecopier in accordance with the
        provisions hereof. A Canadian Lender's actions in compliance with such
        instructions, confirmed and advised to the Canadian Agent by such
        notice, shall be conclusively deemed to have been in accordance with the
        instructions of the Canadian Borrower. This power of attorney may be
        revoked by the Canadian Borrower with respect to any particular Canadian
        Lender at any time upon not less than 5 Banking Days' prior written
        notice served upon the Canadian Lender in question and the Canadian
        Agent, provided that no such revocation shall reduce, limit or otherwise
        affect the obligations of the Canadian Borrower in respect of any
        Bankers' Acceptance executed, completed, endorsed, deposited and/or
        delivered in accordance herewith prior to the time at which such
        revocation becomes effective.

             (6)  If the power of attorney in Section 2.3(a)(5) is revoked with
        respect to any Canadian Lender, the Canadian Borrower shall, from time
        to time as required by the applicable Canadian Lenders, provide to the
        Canadian Agent for delivery to each such Canadian Lender drafts drawn in
        blank by the Canadian Borrower (pre-endorsed and otherwise in fully
        negotiable form, if applicable) in quantities sufficient for each such
        Canadian Lender to fulfil its obligations hereunder. Any such pre-signed
        drafts which are delivered by the Canadian Borrower to the Canadian
        Agent or a Canadian Lender shall be held in safekeeping by the Canadian
        Agent or such Canadian Lender, as the case may be, with the same degree
        of care as if they were the Canadian Agent's or such Canadian Lender's
        property, and shall only be dealt with by the Canadian Lenders and the
        Canadian Agent in accordance herewith. No Canadian Lender shall be
        responsible or liable for its failure to make its share of any Bankers'
        Acceptances required hereunder if the cause of such failure is, in whole
        or in part, due to the failure of the Canadian Borrower to provide
<PAGE>
        such pre-signed drafts to the Canadian Agent (for delivery to such
        Canadian Lender) on a timely basis.

             (7)  Promptly following receipt of a Bankers' Acceptance Notice,
        the Canadian Agent shall so advise the Canadian Lenders and shall advise
        each Canadian Lender of the face amount of each Bankers' Acceptance to
        be accepted by it and the term thereof. The aggregate face amount of
        Bankers' Acceptances to be accepted by a Canadian Lender shall be
        determined by the Canadian Agent by reference to the respective Canadian
        Commitments of the Canadian Lenders, except that, if the face amount of
        a Bankers' Acceptance, which would otherwise be accepted by a Canadian
        Lender, would not be C$100,000.00 or an integral multiple thereof, such
        face amount shall be increased or reduced by the Canadian Agent in its
        sole and unfettered discretion to the nearest integral multiple of
        C$100,000.00.

             (8)  Each Bankers' Acceptance to be accepted by a Canadian Lender
        shall be accepted at such Canadian Lender's office shown on the
        signature pages hereof or as otherwise designated by such Canadian
        Lender from time to time.

             (9)  On the relevant borrowing date, each Canadian Lender severally
        agrees to purchase from the Canadian Borrower, at the face amount
        thereof discounted by the Applicable BA Discount Rate, any Bankers'
        Acceptance accepted by it and provide to the Canadian Agent, for the
        account of the Canadian Borrower, the BA Discount Proceeds in respect
        thereof after deducting therefrom the amount of the Acceptance Fee
        payable by the Canadian Borrower to such Canadian Lender under Section
        2.3(c) in respect of such Bankers' Acceptance.

             (10) Each Canadian Lender may at any time and from time to time
        hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all Bankers'
        Acceptances accepted and purchased by it.

             (11) The Canadian Borrower waives presentment for payment and any
        other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Canadian Lender in
        respect of a Bankers' Acceptance accepted by it pursuant to this
        Agreement which might exist solely by reason of such Bankers' Acceptance
        being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Canadian Lender in its own
        right and the Canadian Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if
        such Canadian Lender as holder sues the Canadian Borrower on the
        Bankers' Acceptances for payment of the amount payable by the Canadian
        Borrower thereunder.

        (b)  With respect to each Bankers' Acceptance, the Canadian Borrower,
prior to the occurrence and continuation of a Default, may give irrevocable
telephone or written notice (or such other method of notification as may be
agreed upon between the Canadian Agent and the Canadian Borrower) to the
Canadian Agent at or before 12:00 noon (Toronto, Ontario time) two (2) Business
Days prior to the maturity date of such Bankers' Acceptance followed by written
confirmation electronically transmitted to the Canadian Agent on the same day,
of the Canadian Borrower's intention to issue one or more Bankers' Acceptance on
such maturity date (each a "Refunding Bankers' Acceptance") to provide for the
payment of such maturing Bankers' Acceptance (it being understood that payments
by the
<PAGE>
Canadian Borrower and fundings by the Canadian Lenders in respect of each
maturing Bankers' Acceptance and each related Refunding Bankers' Acceptance
shall be made on a net basis reflecting the difference between the face amount
of such maturing Bankers' Acceptance and the BA Discount Proceeds (net of the
applicable Acceptance Fee) of such Refunding Bankers' Acceptance). Any funding
on account of any maturing Bankers' Acceptance must be made at or before 12:00
noon (Toronto, Ontario time) on the maturity date of such Bankers' Acceptance.
If the Canadian Borrower fails to give such notice and does not otherwise pay to
the Canadian Agent all Bankers' Acceptance Liabilities on the maturity date of
any such Bankers' Acceptance, then subject to satisfaction of the conditions in
Section 5 hereof and to the Maximum Canadian Available Amount, the Canadian
Borrower shall be irrevocably deemed to have requested and to have been advanced
a Canadian Prime Loan in the face amount of such maturing Bankers' Acceptance on
the maturity date of such Bankers' Acceptance from the Canadian Lender which
accepted such maturing Bankers' Acceptance, which Canadian Prime Loan shall
thereafter bear interest as such in accordance with the provisions hereof until
paid in full.

        (c)  An Acceptance Fee shall be payable by the Canadian Borrower to each
Canadian Lender in advance (in the manner specified in Section 2.3(a)(6)) in
respect of, and as a condition precedent to the acceptance by such Canadian
Lender of, a Bankers' Acceptance to be accepted by such Canadian Lender
calculated at the rate per annum equal to the Margin Percentage applicable to
LIBOR Borrowings, calculated on the face amount of such Bankers' Acceptance and
computed on the basis of the number of days in the term of such Bankers'
Acceptance and a year of 365 days.

        2.4  Terminations, Reductions or Reallocations of Commitments.

        (a)  Mandatory. On the Termination Date, all U.S. Commitments, Canadian
Commitments and U.K. Commitments shall be terminated in their entirety.

        (b)  Optional Termination or Reduction. U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower
or U.K. Borrower, as the case may be, shall have the right to terminate or
reduce the unused portion of the U.S. Commitments, the Canadian Commitments or
the U.K. Commitments, as the case may be, at any time or from time to time,
provided that (i) U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower or U.K. Borrower, as the case
may be, shall give notice of each such termination or reduction to the
appropriate Agent as provided in Section 4.3 hereof and (ii) each such partial
reduction shall be in an integral multiple of $2,000,000. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, U.S. Borrower may not reduce the U.S. Commitments below the then
outstanding principal balance of the U.S. Revolving Loan Obligations, Canadian
Borrower may not reduce the Canadian Commitments below the then outstanding
principal balance of the Canadian Obligations and U.K. Borrower may not reduce
the U.K. Commitments below the then outstanding principal balance of the U.K.
Obligations. No termination or reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this
provision may be reinstated without the prior written approval of Agents and the
Lenders.

        (c)  Optional Increase. At any time after September 1, 2004 and so long
as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred which is continuing, U.S.
Borrower shall have the right to increase the U.S. Commitments by an amount not
exceeding $20,000,000, in the aggregate, provided that (i) the U.S. Borrower
shall give notice of each such increase to the U.S. Agent as provided in Section
4.3 hereof, (ii) no Lender shall be required to increase its U.S. Commitment
<PAGE>
unless it shall have expressly agreed to such increase in writing (but
otherwise, no notice to or consent by any Lender shall be required,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 11.5 hereof),
(iii) the addition of new U.S. Lenders shall be subject to the terms and
provisions of Section 11.6 hereof as if such new U.S. Lenders were acquiring an
interest in the U.S. Loans by assignment from an existing U.S. Lenders (to the
extent applicable, i.e. required approvals, minimum amounts, execution of new
U.S. Revolving Notes and the like), (iv) the U.S. Borrower shall execute and
deliver such additional or replacement U.S. Revolving Notes and such other
documentation (including evidence of proper authorization) as may be reasonably
requested by the U.S. Agent, any new U.S. Lenders or any U.S. Lenders which is
increasing its Commitment and (v) each such increase shall be in an aggregate
amount of at least $5,000,000. If the U.S. Borrower shall terminate or reduce
the U.S. Commitments pursuant to Section 2.4(b) hereof, it shall have no further
right to increase the U.S. Commitments pursuant to this Section. U.S. Borrower
shall be required to pay (or to reimburse each applicable U.S. Lender for) any
breakage costs incurred by any U.S. Lender in connection with the need to
reallocate existing U.S. Loans among the U.S. Lenders following any increase in
the U.S. Commitments pursuant to this provision.

        (d)  Reallocations. Subject to agreement by the Borrowers, any Dual
Lender may reallocate its existing U.S. Commitment and Canadian Commitment or
U.K. Commitment, as the case may be, so long as the sum of such U.S. Commitment
and Canadian Commitment or U.K. Commitment, as the case may be, remains
unchanged. In addition, with the prior written consent of all of the Dual
Lenders, any U.S. Lender may agree with Borrowers to convert a portion of its
U.S. Commitment into a Canadian Commitment or a U.K. Commitment, thereby
becoming a Dual Lender, any Canadian Lender may agree with Borrowers to convert
a portion of its Canadian Commitment into a U.S. Commitment and any U.K. Lender
may agree with Borrowers to convert a portion of its U.K Commitment into a U.S.
Commitment, in each case so long as (i) each Lender continues to be a U.S.
Lender with a U.S. Commitment of at least $1,000,000 and (ii) the sum of such
Lender's U.S. Commitment and Canadian Commitment or U.K. Commitment, as the case
may be, remains equal to the aggregate amount of such Lender's U.S. Commitment
and Canadian Commitment or U.K. Commitment, as the case may be, prior to such
reallocation. Borrowers shall give written notice to the Agents of any
reallocation pursuant to this provision at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the effective date of any such reallocation. No Lender shall be required to
agree to any such reallocation, but may do so at its option, in its sole
discretion. The following conditions precedent must be satisfied prior to any
such reallocation becoming effective:

             (1)  no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
        continuing;

             (2)  if, as a result of any such reallocation, the aggregate U.S.
        Revolving Loan Obligations would exceed the aggregate of all of the U.S.
        Commitments, then the U.S. Borrower shall, on the effective date of such
        reallocation, repay or prepay U.S. Revolving Loans (or provide Cover for
        Letter of Credit Liabilities relating to U.S. Letters of Credit) in
        accordance with this Agreement in an aggregate principal amount such
        that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate U.S. Revolving Loan
        Obligations shall not exceed the aggregate of all of the U.S.
        Commitments;
<PAGE>
             (3)  if, as a result of any such reallocation, the Canadian
        Obligations would exceed the aggregate of all of the Canadian
        Commitments, then the Canadian Borrower shall, on the effective date of
        such reallocation, repay or prepay Canadian Revolving Loans (or provide
        Cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities relating to Canadian Letters of
        Credit or for Bankers' Acceptance Liabilities) in accordance with this
        Agreement in an aggregate principal amount such that, after giving
        effect thereto, the Canadian Obligations shall not exceed the aggregate
        of all of the Canadian Commitments;

             (4)  if, as a result of any such reallocation, the U.K. Obligations
        would exceed the aggregate of all of the U.K. Commitments, then the U.K.
        Borrower shall, on the effective date of such reallocation, repay or
        prepay U.K. Revolving Loans (or provide Cover for Letter of Credit
        Liabilities relating to U.K. Letters of Credit) in accordance with this
        Agreement in an aggregate principal amount such that, after giving
        effect thereto, the U.K. Obligations shall not exceed the aggregate of
        all of the U.K. Commitments;

             (5)  Borrowers shall have paid any amounts (or shall have provided
        Cover) due under Sections 2.9(c) or (d) hereof on the date of
        such reallocation;

             (6)  the Maximum Canadian Available Amount shall be adjusted to
        equal the sum of all of the Canadian Commitments after giving effect to
        such reallocation, the Maximum U.K. Available Amount shall be adjusted
        to equal the sum of all of the U.K. Commitments after giving effect to
        such reallocation and the Maximum U.S. Available Amount shall be
        adjusted to equal the sum of all of the U.S. Commitments after giving
        effect to such reallocation;

             (7)  participations by the Lenders in the outstanding Letters of
        Credit and the Letter of Credit Liabilities and the outstanding Loans of
        the Lenders shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation;
        provided, however, that in lieu of requiring any prepayment of any
        Bankers' Acceptances in order to make appropriate adjustments to give
        effect to such reallocations, Canadian Borrower shall be required to
        provide additional Cover for any applicable portion of the Bankers'
        Acceptance Liabilities;

             (8)  each Lender whose U.S. Commitment, Canadian Commitment or U.K.
        Commitment shall be the subject of any reallocation shall have received
        from the Borrowers a fee equal to the greater of $3,000.00 or 1/16% of
        the amount of the increase or decrease, as the case be, in its Canadian
        Commitment or U.K. Commitment, as the case may be.

        2.5  Commitment Fees.

        (a)  U.S. Borrower shall pay to U.S. Agent for the account of each U.S.
Lender, Canadian Borrower shall pay to Canadian Agent for the account of each
Canadian Lender and U.K. Borrower shall pay to U.K. Agent for the account of
each U.K. Lender, commitment fees for the Availability Period at a rate per
annum equal to the Commitment Fee Percentage. Such commitment fees shall be
computed (on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year composed
of 360 days) on each day and shall be based on the excess of (x) the aggregate
amount
<PAGE>
of each Lender's U.S. Commitment, Canadian Commitment or U.K. Commitment,
as the case may be, for such day over (y) the sum of (i) the aggregate unpaid
principal balance (in Dollars) of such Lender's applicable Note or Notes on such
day plus (ii) the aggregate applicable Letter of Credit Liabilities as to such
Lender for such day plus, in the case of Canadian Lenders only, (iii) the
aggregate Bankers' Acceptance Liabilities outstanding on such day. Accrued
commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the Quarterly Dates prior to the
Termination Date and on the Termination Date, with any Canadian Obligations
converted to Dollars at the Exchange Rate on each such date for the purposes of
each such calculation.

        (b)  All past due fees payable under this Section shall bear interest at
the Past Due Rate.

        2.6  Several Obligations. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan to
be made by it or to accept and purchase any Bankers' Acceptance required to be
so accepted and purchased by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve
any other Lender of its obligation to make its Loan or to accept and purchase
its Bankers' Acceptance on such date, but neither any Agent nor any Lender shall
be responsible or liable for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan or
to accept and purchase any Bankers' Acceptance or to participate in, or
co-issue, any Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, (i) if a U.S. Lender fails to make a U.S. Revolving Loan as and when
required hereunder, then upon each subsequent event which would otherwise result
in payments of principal being made to the defaulting U.S. Lender, the amount
which would have been paid to the defaulting U.S. Lender shall be divided among
the non-defaulting U.S. Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitment
Percentages until the Obligations of each U.S. Lender (including the defaulting
U.S. Lender) are equal to such U.S. Lender's Commitment Percentage of the total
U.S. Revolving Loan Obligations, (ii) if a Canadian Lender fails to make a
Canadian Revolving Loan or accept and purchase any Bankers' Acceptance as and
when required hereunder, then upon each subsequent event which would otherwise

                  the net cash proceeds of any payment or award in excess of
                  $1,000,000 made to any such Person under any policy of
                  Property insurance with respect to any Property owned by such
                  Person or pursuant to any condemnation award with respect to
                  any such Property; provided such amounts have not theretofore
                  been reasonably expended for the restoration or replacement of
                  the asset in respect of which such payment or award was made.
                  Such amounts shall be collaterally assigned to U.S. Agent as
                  security for the U.S. Obligations in a manner reasonably
                  acceptable to U.S. Agent. Upon delivery to U.S. Agent of

                  Obligor has reasonably expended amounts or committed in
                  writing to expend amounts for the restoration or replacement
                  of the asset in respect of which such payment or award was
                  made, specifying the amount expended or committed, so long as
                  no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                  continuing any such amount deposited with U.S. Agent shall be
                  released by U.S. Agent to U.S. Borrower; provided, however,
                  that, in the event that within 180 days of receipt of such
                  payment or award by U.S. Borrower, to the extent U.S. Borrower
                  shall not have actually spent or certified to U.S. Agent its
                  intention to expend a substantially equivalent amount for the
                  restoration or replacement of the asset in respect of which
                  such payment or award was made or to purchase other assets
                  that may be productively used in the business of the U.S.
                  Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary, U.S. Borrower shall
                  make a prepayment on the Term Loans (using any funds deposited
                  with U.S. Agent pursuant to this Section 3.2(b)(1) or other
                  funds) in the amount of the excess of the amount of such
                  payment or award over the amount of such expenditures and/or
                  commitment on such 180th day. Such prepayment shall be applied
                  to the Term Notes secured by the applicable Collateral and
                  shall be applied to scheduled principal installments in
                  inverse order of their maturities.

                      (ii)   In cases where the amount of the net cash proceeds
                  of any payment or award is equal to or less than $1,000,000
                  and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
                  continuing, such proceeds may be paid to any Obligor, and if
                  received by U.S. Agent shall be paid by U.S. Agent to U.S.
                  Borrower, for use in
<PAGE>
                  paying for replacements or repairs of or substitutes for the
                  damaged, destroyed or taken assets or in a manner otherwise
                  consistent with this Agreement.

        prepayment on the Term Loans in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%)
        of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year less (ii) optional prepayments
        made on the Term Loans during such fiscal year. Such prepayment shall be
        applied ratably to the Term Notes (based on outstanding principal
        balances) and shall be applied to scheduled principal installments in
        inverse order of their maturities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
        obligations to make payments under this Section 3.2(b)(2) shall cease at

        after written notice thereof (exclusive of any cure by means of a waiver
        by U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or by payment by U.S.
        Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

             are to be converted or for which an Interest Option is designated;
             the proposed date for the
<PAGE>
             designation or conversion and the Interest Period or Periods, if
             any, selected by the applicable Borrower. Such telephonic notice

         (v) Each request for a LIBOR Borrowing shall be in the amount equal to
             $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof.

        (vi) Each designation of an Interest Option with respect to the U.S.
             Revolving Notes shall apply to all of the U.S. Revolving Notes

             Option with respect to the U.K. Revolving Notes shall apply to all
             of the U.K. Revolving Notes ratably in accordance with their
             respective outstanding principal balances. Each designation of an
             Interest Option with respect to the Term Notes shall apply to all
             of the Term Notes ratably in accordance with their respective
             outstanding principal balances. If any Lender assigns an interest
             in any of its Notes when any LIBOR Borrowing is outstanding with
             respect thereto, then such assignee shall have its ratable interest
             in such LIBOR Borrowing.

       (vii) The entire outstanding principal balance of the Canadian Dollar
             Revolving Notes shall bear interest at the Canadian Prime Rate.

        (c)  Special Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Borrowings.

        (i)  Options Unlawful. If the adoption of any applicable Legal
Requirement after the Effective Date or any change after the Effective Date in
any applicable Legal Requirement or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) issued after the
Effective Date by any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall at any
time make it
<PAGE>
unlawful or impossible for any Lender to permit the establishment of or
to maintain any LIBOR Borrowing, the commitment of such Lender to establish such
LIBOR Borrowing shall forthwith be canceled and the applicable Borrower shall
forthwith, shall on the last day of the Interest Period relating to any
outstanding LIBOR Borrowing (or within such earlier period as may be required by
applicable law) (1) convert the LIBOR Borrowing of such Lender with respect to
which such demand was made to a Base Rate Borrowing; (2) pay all accrued and
unpaid interest to date on the amount so converted; and (3) pay any amounts
required to compensate each Lender for any additional cost or expense which any
Lender may incur as a result of such adoption of or change in such Legal
Requirement or in the interpretation or administration thereof and any Funding
Loss which any Lender may incur as a result of such conversion. If, when any
Agent so notifies any Borrower, such Borrower has given a Rate Designation
Notice specifying a LIBOR Borrowing but the selected Interest Period has not yet
begun, as to the applicable Lender such Rate Designation Notice shall be deemed
to be of no force and effect, as if never made, and the balance of the Loans
made by such Lender specified in such Rate Designation Notice shall bear
interest at the Base Rate until a different available Interest Option shall be
designated in accordance herewith.

        (ii) Increased Cost of Borrowings. Subject to Section 11.17, if the
adoption after the Effective Date of any applicable Legal Requirement or any
change after the Effective Date in any applicable Legal Requirement or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority or
compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) issued after the Effective Date by any central bank or
Governmental Authority shall at any time as a result of any portion of the
principal balances of the Notes being maintained on the basis of a Eurodollar
Rate:

             (1)  subject any Lender to any Taxes, or any deduction or
                  withholding for any Taxes, on or from any payment due under
                  any LIBOR Borrowing or other amount due hereunder, other than
                  income and franchise taxes of the United States or its
                  political subdivisions or such other jurisdiction in which the
                  applicable Lender has its principal office or applicable
                  lending office; or

             (2)  change the basis of taxation of payments due from any Borrower
                  to any Lender under any LIBOR Borrowing (otherwise than by a
                  change in the rate of taxation of the overall net income of
                  such Lender); or

             (3)  impose, modify, increase or deem applicable any reserve
                  requirement (excluding that portion of any reserve requirement
                  included in the calculation of the applicable Eurodollar
                  Rate), special deposit requirement or similar requirement
                  (including, but not limited to, state law requirements)
                  against assets of any Lender, or against deposits with any
                  Lender, or against loans made by any Lender, or against any
                  other funds, obligations or other Property owned or held by
                  any Lender; or

             (4)  impose on any Lender any other condition regarding any LIBOR
                  Borrowing;
<PAGE>
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Lender of
agreeing to make or of making, renewing or maintaining such LIBOR Borrowing, or
reduce the amount of principal or interest received by any Lender, then, within
15 Business Days after demand by any Agent (accompanied by a statement setting
forth in reasonable detail the applicable Lender's basis therefor), the
applicable Borrower shall pay to the applicable Agent additional amounts which
shall compensate each Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount. The
reasonable, good faith determination by any Lender of the amount of any such
increased cost, increased reserve requirement or reduced amount shall be
conclusive and binding, absent manifest error. Each Borrower shall have the
right, if it receives from any Agent any notice referred to in this paragraph,
upon three Business Days' notice to the applicable Agent (which shall notify
each affected Lender), either (i) to repay in full (but not in part) any
borrowing with respect to which such notice was given, together with any accrued
interest thereon, or (ii) to convert the LIBOR Borrowing which is the subject of
the notice to a Base Rate Borrowing; provided, that any such repayment or
conversion shall be accompanied by payment of (x) the amount required to
compensate each Lender for the increased cost or reduced amount referred to in
the preceding paragraph; (y) all accrued and unpaid interest to date on the
amount so repaid or converted, and (z) any Funding Loss which any Lender may
incur as a result of such repayment or conversion. Each Lender will notify the
applicable Borrower through the applicable Agent of any event occurring after
the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Lender to compensation
pursuant to this Section as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge
thereof and determines to request such compensation, and (if so requested by the
applicable Borrower through the applicable Agent) will designate a different
lending office of such Lender for the applicable LIBOR Borrowing or will take
such other action as the applicable Borrower may reasonable request if such
designation or action is consistent with the internal policy of such Lender and
legal and regulatory restrictions, will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such Lender, be
disadvantageous to such Lender.

        (iii)Inadequacy of Pricing and Rate Determination. If, for any reason
with respect to any Interest Period, the applicable Agent (or, in the case of
clause 3 below, the applicable Lender) shall have reasonably and in good faith
determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
applicable Borrower, absent manifest error) that:

             (1)  such Agent is unable through its customary general practices
                  to determine any applicable Eurodollar Rate, or

             (2)  by reason of circumstances affecting the applicable market,
                  generally, such Agent is not being offered deposits in United
                  States dollars in such market, for the applicable Interest
                  Period and in an amount equal to the amount of any applicable
                  LIBOR Borrowing requested by the applicable Borrower, or

             (3)  any applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly
                  reflect the cost to any Lender of making and maintaining such
                  LIBOR Borrowing hereunder for any proposed Interest Period,
<PAGE>
then the applicable Agent shall give the applicable Borrower notice thereof and
thereupon, (A) any Rate Designation Notice previously given by such Borrower
designating the applicable LIBOR Borrowing which has not commenced as of the
date of such notice from such Agent shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to
be of no force and effect, as if never given, and (B) until the applicable Agent
shall notify such Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice
from such Agent no longer exist, each Rate Designation Notice requesting the
applicable Eurodollar Rate shall be deemed a request for a Base Rate Borrowing,
and any applicable LIBOR Borrowing then outstanding shall be converted, without
any notice to or from the applicable Borrower, upon the termination of the
Interest Period then in effect with respect to it, to a Base Rate Borrowing.

        (iv) Funding Losses. Each Borrower shall indemnify each applicable
Lender against and hold each applicable Lender harmless from any Funding Loss
relating to Loans to such Borrower or relating to Bankers' Acceptances requested
by such Borrower. Subject to Section 11.17, this indemnity shall survive the
payment of the Notes. Within 15 Business Days after demand by any Agent
(accompanied by a certificate of the applicable Lender setting forth in
reasonable detail the amount and calculation of the amount claimed as to any
Funding Losses, which shall be conclusive and binding upon the applicable
Borrower, absent manifest error), the applicable Borrower shall pay to such
Agent, for the account of such Lender, the amount of such Funding Losses.

        (d)  Funding Offices; Adjustments Automatic; Calculation Year. Any
Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its obligation as to any LIBOR Borrowing by
causing a branch or affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan and may transfer
and carry such Loan at, to or for the account of any branch office or affiliate
of such Lender; provided, that in such event for the purposes of this Agreement
such Loan shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender and the obligation of
the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan shall nevertheless be to such Lender
and shall be deemed held by it for the account of such branch or affiliate.
Without notice to any Borrower or any other Person, each rate required to be
calculated or determined under this Agreement shall automatically fluctuate
upward and downward in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Interest at the Canadian Prime Rate or any applicable Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year consisting
of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. All other interest required to be
calculated or determined under this Agreement shall be computed on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed in a year consisting of 360 days, unless the
Ceiling Rate would thereby be exceeded, in which event, to the extent necessary
to avoid exceeding the Ceiling Rate, the applicable interest shall be computed
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable calendar
year in which accrued.

        (e)  Funding Sources. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of
all or any part of the Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood,
however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder
shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each LIBOR
Borrowing during each Interest Period through the purchase of deposits having a
maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate
equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

4.      Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Computations, Etc.

        4.1  Payments.

        (a)  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of
principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and other amounts to be made by
any Borrower hereunder, under the Notes and under the other Loan Documents shall
be made, without set-off or counterclaim, in (i) with respect to Bankers'
Acceptance Liabilities and Canadian Prime Loans, Canadian Dollars and (ii) in
all other cases, in Dollars, in immediately available funds, to the applicable
Agent at its Principal Office (or in the case of a successor U.S. Agent, at the
principal office of such successor U.S. Agent in the United States, in the case
of a successor Canadian Agent, at the principal office of such successor
Canadian Agent in Canada and in the case of a successor U.K. Agent, at the
principal office of such successor U.K. Agent in the United Kingdom), not later
than 11:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time (in the case of any payment by the U.S.
Borrower), 12:00 noon Toronto, Ontario time (in the case of any payment by the
Canadian Borrower) or 11:00 a.m. London, United Kingdom time (in the case of any
payment by the U.K. Borrower) on the date on which such payment shall become due
(each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have
been made on the next succeeding Business Day).

        (b)  Each Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment hereunder,
under any Note or under any other Loan Document, specify to the applicable Agent
the Obligations payable by such Borrower hereunder or thereunder to which such
payment is to be applied. Each payment received by any Agent hereunder, under
any Note or under any other Loan Document for the account of a Lender shall be
paid promptly to such Lender, in immediately available funds. If any Agent fails
to send to any Lender the applicable amount by the close of business on the date
any such payment is received by such Agent if such payment is received prior to
11:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time (in the case of any payment to a U.S. Lender) or
12:00 noon Toronto, Ontario time (in the case of any payment to a Canadian
Lender) or 11:00 a.m. London, United Kingdom time (in the case of any payment to
a U.K. Lender) (or on the next succeeding Business Day with respect to payments
which are received after such time), such Agent shall pay to the applicable
Lender interest on such amount from such date at a rate of interest per annum
equal to (i) in respect of Obligations which are denominated in Dollars, the
Federal Funds Rate and (ii) in respect of Canadian Obligations which are
denominated in Canadian Dollars, the CDOR Rate. Borrowers, Lenders and Agents
acknowledge and agree that this provision and each other provision of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents relating to the application of
amounts in payment of the Obligations shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 4.2(d) regarding pro rata application of amounts after an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

        (c)  If the due date of any payment hereunder or under any other Loan
Document falls on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date for such
payments (except as otherwise provided in clause (2) of the definition of
"Interest Period") shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and
interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such
extension.

        (d)  All payments by any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for or on account
of any present or future
<PAGE>
income, stamp, or other taxes, fees, duties, withholding or other charges
of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority excluding in
the case of each Agent, each Issuer and each Lender taxes imposed on or measured
by its net income or franchise taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which it is
organized or through which it acts for purposes of this Agreement (such
non-excluded items being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any withholding
or deduction from any payment to be made to, or for the account of, any Agent,
any Issuer or any Lender by any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan
Document is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law,
rule, or regulation, then such Borrower will (i) pay to the relevant authority
the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted; (ii) to the extent
available, promptly forward to the applicable Agent an official receipt or other
documentation reasonably satisfactory to such Agent evidencing such payment to
such authority; and (iii) pay to the applicable Agent, for the account of each
affected Person, such additional amount or amounts as are necessary to ensure
that the net amount actually received by such Person will equal the full amount
such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been
required. Each such Person shall reasonably and in good faith determine such
additional amount or amounts payable to it (which determination shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on each Borrower). If any
Agent, any Issuer or any Lender becomes aware that any such withholding or
deduction from any payment to be made by any Borrower hereunder or under any
other Loan Document is required, then such Person shall promptly notify the
applicable Agent and the applicable Borrower thereof stating the reasons
therefor and the additional amount required to be paid under this Section. Each
Lender shall execute and deliver to the applicable Agent and the applicable
Borrower such forms as it may be required to execute and deliver pursuant to
Section 11.13 hereof. To the extent that any such withholding or deduction
results from a breach of a representation by a Lender set forth herein or from
the failure of a Lender to provide a form required by Section 11.13 hereof
(unless such failure is due to some prohibition under applicable Legal
Requirements), the applicable Borrower shall have no obligation to pay the
additional amount required by clause (iii) above. Anything in this Section
notwithstanding, if any Lender elects to require payment by any Borrower of any
material amount under this Section, the applicable Borrower may, within 60 days
after the date of receiving notice thereof and so long as no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, elect to terminate such Lender as a party to this
Agreement; provided that, concurrently with such termination the applicable
Borrower shall (i) if the Agents and each of the other Lenders shall consent,
pay that Lender all principal, interest and fees and other amounts owed to such
Lender through such date of termination or (ii) have arranged for another
financial institution approved by the Agents (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) as of such date, to become a substitute Lender
for all purposes under this Agreement in the manner provided in Section 11.6;
provided further that, prior to substitution for any Lender, the applicable
Borrower shall have given written notice to the Agents of such intention and the
Lenders shall have the option, but no obligation, for a period of 60 days after
receipt of such notice, to increase their U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments
or U.K. Commitments, as the case may be, in order to replace the affected Lender
in lieu of such substitution.

        4.2  Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:
(a) each borrowing from the Lenders under Section 2.1 hereof shall be made (w)
in the case of Canadian Revolving Loans, ratably from the Canadian Lenders in
accordance with their respective Canadian Commitments, (x) in the case of U.K.
Revolving Loans, ratably from the U.K. Lenders in accordance with their
respective U.K. Commitments, (y) in the case of U.S. Revolving Loans,
<PAGE>
ratably from the U.S. Lenders in accordance with their respective U.S.
Commitments and (z) in the case of Term Loans, ratably from the Term Loan
Lenders in accordance with the amounts set forth opposite their signature lines
hereto under the heading "Term Loans"; (b) each payment of commitment fees shall
be made for the account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the
U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments of the Lenders under
Section 2.3 hereof shall be applied, pro rata, according to the Lenders'
respective U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments, as the
case may be; (c) each payment by any Borrower of principal of or interest on the
Term Loans, Canadian Revolving Loans, U.K. Revolving Loans, U.S. Revolving Loans
or any Bankers' Acceptance, as the case may be, prior to the occurrence of an
Event of Default (or after the applicable Event of Default shall have been fully
cured or waived) shall be made to the applicable Agent for the account of the
applicable Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal
amounts of the Term Loans, Canadian Revolving Loans, U.K. Revolving Loans or
U.S. Revolving Loans (as the case may be) held by or Bankers' Acceptances
accepted by such Lenders; (d) each payment by any Borrower of principal of or
interest on the Term Loans, Canadian Revolving Loans, U.K. Revolving Loans, U.S.
Revolving Loans or any Bankers' Acceptance, as the case may be, while an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, shall be made to the
applicable Agent for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the
respective unpaid principal amounts of the Obligations held by the Lenders (i.e.
such payments shall be shared by all of the Lenders and not restricted to the
holders of U.S. Revolving Notes, Canadian Revolving Notes, Canadian Dollar
Revolving Notes, U.K. Revolving Notes or Term Notes, or Lenders having accepted
Bankers' Acceptances, as the case may be, regardless of any attempted contrary
designation by any Borrower), and (e) the applicable Lenders (other than the
applicable Issuer) shall purchase from the applicable Issuer participations in
each Letter of Credit to the extent of their respective Commitment Percentages.

        4.3  Certain Actions, Notices, Etc. Notices to the applicable Agent of
any termination or reduction of U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K.
Commitments, as the case may be, and of borrowings and optional prepayments of
Loans and requests for issuances of Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and
shall be effective only if received by the applicable Agent not later than noon
Houston, Texas time (in the case of U.S. Revolving Loans which are same day
fundings), 11:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time (in the case of U.S. Revolving Loans
which are not same day fundings and U.S. Letters of Credit), 12:00 noon Toronto,
Ontario time (in the case of Canadian Revolving Loans which are not same day
fundings, Bankers' Acceptances and Canadian Letters of Credit), 10:00 a.m.

day fundings), 11:00 a.m. London, United Kingdom time (in the case of U.K.

which are same day fundings) on the number of Business Days prior to the date of
the relevant termination, reduction, borrowing and/or prepayment specified

Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the amount of the
applicable U.S. Commitment, Canadian Commitment or U.K. Commitment to be
terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing or prepayment shall specify
the amount of the Loans to be borrowed or prepaid and the date of borrowing or
prepayment (which shall be a Business Day). The applicable Agent shall promptly
notify the affected Lenders of the contents of each such notice.

        4.4 Non-Receipt of Funds by Any Agent. Unless the applicable Agent shall
have been notified by a Lender or a Borrower (the "Payor") prior to the date on
which such Lender is to make payment to such Agent of the proceeds of a Loan (or
funding of a drawing under a Letter of Credit or reimbursement with respect to
any drawing under a Letter of Credit or funding of a payment under a Bankers'
Acceptance or reimbursement with respect to any payment under a Bankers'
Acceptance) to be made by it hereunder or the applicable Borrower is to make a
payment to such Agent for the account of one or more of the Lenders, as the case
may be (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice
shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make the
Required Payment to such Agent, the applicable Agent may assume that the
Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but
shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended
recipient on such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required
Payment to such Agent, the recipient of such payment (or, if such recipient is
the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower and, if such
Borrower fails to pay the amount thereof to the applicable Agent forthwith upon
demand, the applicable Lenders ratably in proportion to their
<PAGE>
respective Commitment Percentages) shall, on demand, pay to such Agent
the amount made available by such Agent, together with interest thereon in
respect of the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available
by such Agent until the date Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum for
such period equal to (i) in respect of Obligations which are denominated in
Dollars, the Federal Funds Rate and (ii) in respect of Canadian Obligations
which are denominated in Canadian Dollars, the CDOR Rate.

        4.5  Sharing of Payments, Etc. If a Lender shall obtain payment of any
principal of or interest on any Loan made by it under this Agreement, on any
Reimbursement Obligation or on any other Obligation then due to such Lender
hereunder, through the exercise of any right of set-off (including, without
limitation, any right of setoff or Lien granted under Section 9.2 hereof),
banker's lien, counterclaim or similar right, or otherwise, it shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders participations in the Loans made, or
Reimbursement Obligations or other Obligations held, by the other Lenders in
such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be
equitable to the end that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such
payment (net of any expenses which may be incurred by such Lender in obtaining
or preserving such benefit) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid Obligations
then due to each of them. To such end all the Lenders shall make appropriate
adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise)
if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. Each Borrower
agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law,
that any Lender so purchasing a participation in the Loans made, or
Reimbursement Obligations or other Obligations held, by other Lenders may
exercise all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
holder of Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or other Obligations in the amount of
such participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and
retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other
indebtedness or obligation of any Borrower.

Borrower and U.K. Borrower each represents and warrants (such representations
and warranties to survive any investigation and the making of the Loans and the
issuance of any Letters of Credit and the acceptance and purchase of any
Bankers' Acceptances) to the Lenders, Issuers and Agents as follows:

        6.1  Organization. Each Obligor (a) is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; (b)
has all necessary power and authority to conduct its business as presently
conducted; and (c) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in the

to so qualify could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        6.2  Financial  Statements.  Borrowers  have  furnished  to Agents  (a)
audited consolidated financial statements (including a balance sheet) as to U.S.
Borrower that fairly present in all material respects,  in accordance with GAAP,

Borrower as at the end of the fiscal years ended  December 31, 2001 and December
31, 2002; (b) unaudited  consolidating financial statements (including a balance

quarters  ended March 31, 2003,  June 30, 2003,  September 30, 2003 and December
31, 2003.  No events,  conditions or  circumstances  have occurred from the date
that the financial statements were delivered to Agent through the Effective Date
which would cause said  financial  statements  to be  misleading in any material
respect.  Except for the Loan  Documents,  there are no material  instruments or
liabilities which should be reflected in such financial  statements  provided to
Agent which are not so reflected.
<PAGE>
        6.3  Enforceable Obligations; Authorization. The Loan Documents to which
the applicable Obligors are parties are legal, valid and binding obligations of
each applicable Obligor, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,

necessary corporate action; (b) are within the corporate power and authority of
each applicable Obligor; (c) do not and will not contravene or violate any Legal
Requirement applicable to any applicable Obligor or the Organizational Documents

agreement or instrument by which any Obligor or any of its Property may be
bound, and (e) do not and will not result in the creation of any Lien upon any
Property of any Obligor, except in favor of Agents as expressly contemplated
herein or therein. All necessary permits, registrations and consents for such
making and performance have been obtained. Except as otherwise expressly stated
in the Security Documents, the Liens of the Loan Documents will constitute valid
and perfected first and prior Liens on the Property described therein, subject
to no other Liens whatsoever except Permitted Liens.

        6.4  Other Debt. No Obligor is in default in the payment of any other
Borrowed Money Indebtedness or under any agreement, mortgage, deed of trust,
security agreement or lease to which it is a party and which default could

        6.5  Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.5 hereto, there is no
material litigation or administrative proceeding, to the knowledge of any
executive officer of any Borrower, pending or threatened against, nor any
material outstanding judgment, order or decree against, any Obligor before or by

permitted under Section 8.2 hereof).

        6.7  Taxes. Each Obligor has filed all tax returns required to have been
filed by it and paid all taxes shown thereon to be due, except those for which
extensions have been obtained and those which are being contested in good faith
or where the failure to make required filings or pay required taxes could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        6.8  Regulations U and X. None of the proceeds of any Loan or proceeds
from the acceptance and purchase of Bankers' Acceptances will be used for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying directly or indirectly any margin stock or for
any other purpose that would constitute this transaction a "purpose credit"
within the meaning of Regulations U and X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, as any of them may be amended from time to time.
<PAGE>
        6.9  Subsidiaries. As of the Effective Date, U.S. Borrower has no

other writing furnished to the Lenders by or on behalf of any Obligor in
connection with the transactions contemplated in any Loan Document contains any
untrue statement of material fact or omits to state any such fact necessary to

such other document, instrument or writing not misleading in any material
respect.

the Controlled Group have fulfilled their obligations, including obligations
under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code and are in compliance
in all material respects with the provisions of ERISA and the Code. No event has
occurred which could result in a liability of any Borrower or any member of the
Controlled Group to the PBGC or a Plan (other than to make contributions in the
ordinary course) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. There have not been any nor are there now existing any events or
conditions that would cause the Lien provided under Section 4068 of ERISA to
attach to any Property of any Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group.
Except as described on Schedule 6.11 hereto, the aggregate Unfunded Liabilities
in respect of all Plans as of the date hereof do not exceed $1,000,000. No

Requirements applicable to it, except to the extent that the failure to comply
therewith could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
<PAGE>

their respective executive officers, obtained and maintained in effect all
Environmental Permits (or the applicable Person has initiated the necessary
steps to transfer the Environmental Permits into its name or obtain such
permits), the failure to obtain which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Obligor and its Properties, business and
operations have been and are, to the best knowledge of their respective
executive officers, in compliance with all applicable Requirements of
Environmental Law and Environmental Permits the failure to comply with which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Obligor and

Claims or (B), to the best knowledge of their respective executive officers

respective Corporations), Environmental Liabilities, in either case direct or
contingent, arising from or based upon any act, omission, event, condition or
circumstance occurring or existing on or prior to the date hereof which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the officers
of any Obligor has received any notice of any violation or alleged violation of

Borrower or U.K. Borrower knows of any event or condition with respect to
currently enacted Requirements of Environmental Laws presently scheduled to
become effective in the future with respect to any of the Properties of any
Obligor which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,

reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital as a consequence of its
obligations hereunder, under the Letters of Credit, the Notes or other
Obligations held by it to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration

        9.2  Right of Setoff. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time
to time, without notice to any Obligor (any such notice being expressly waived
by U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower, U.K. Borrower and the other Obligors), to
setoff and apply any and all deposits, whether general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final (but excluding the funds held in accounts clearly
designated as escrow or trust accounts held by U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower,
U.K. Borrower or any other Obligor for the benefit of Persons which are not
Affiliates of any Obligor), whether or not such setoff results in any loss of
interest or other penalty, and including without limitation all certificates of
deposit, at any time held, and any other funds or Property at any time held, and
other Borrowed Money Indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower, U.K. Borrower or any
other Obligor against any and all of the Obligations irrespective of whether or
not such Lender or any Agent will have made any demand under this Agreement, the
Notes or any other Loan Document. Should the right of any Lender to realize
funds in any manner set forth hereinabove be challenged and any application of
such funds be reversed, whether by court order or otherwise, the Lenders shall
make restitution or refund to U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower or U.K. Borrower
or the applicable other Obligor, as the case may be, pro rata in accordance with
their U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments, as the case
may be. Each Lender agrees to promptly notify U.S. Borrower, Canadian Borrower,
U.K. Borrower and Agents after any such setoff and application, provided that
the failure to give such notice will not affect the validity of such setoff and
application. The rights of Agents and the Lenders under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including without limitation other rights
of setoff) which Agents or the Lenders may have. This Section is subject to the
terms and provisions of Sections 4.5 and 11.7 hereof. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, any
amounts realized under this Section which constitute an asset of any Foreign
Subsidiary shall only be applied to the payment of Canadian Obligations or U.K.
Obligations.

        9.3  Collateral Account. U.S. Borrower hereby agrees, in addition to
the provisions of Section 9.1 hereof, that upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, it shall, if requested by any Agent or by
the Majority Lenders (through any Agent), pay to U.S. Agent an amount in
immediately available funds equal to the then aggregate amount available for
drawings under all outstanding U.S. Letters of Credit, which funds shall be held
by U.S. Agent as Cover. Canadian Borrower hereby agrees, in addition to the
provisions of Section 9.1 hereof, that upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, it shall, if requested by any Agent or by
the Majority Lenders (through any Agent), pay to Canadian Agent an amount in
immediately available funds equal to the sum of the then aggregate amount
available for drawings under all outstanding Canadian Letters of Credit plus the
unpaid principal balance of all outstanding Bankers' Acceptances, which funds
shall be held by Canadian Agent as Cover. U.K. Borrower hereby agrees, in
addition to the provisions of Section 9.1 hereof, that upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, it shall, if requested by any
Agent or by the Majority Lenders (through any Agent), pay to U.K. Agent an
amount in immediately available funds equal to the then aggregate amount
available for drawings under all outstanding U.K. Letters of Credit, which funds
shall be held by U.K. Agent as Cover.

        9.4  Preservation of Security for Letter of Credit Liabilities. In the
event that, following (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default and the exercise
of any rights available to any
<PAGE>
Agent or any Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii) payment in full of the
principal amount then outstanding of and the accrued interest on the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations and fees and all other amounts payable hereunder and
under the Loan Documents and all other amounts secured by the Security
Documents, any Letters of Credit or Bankers' Acceptances shall remain
outstanding and undrawn upon, the applicable Agent shall be entitled to hold
(and each Borrower and each other Obligor hereby grants and conveys to Agent a
security interest in and to) all cash or other Property ("Proceeds of Remedies")
realized or arising out of the exercise of any rights available under the Loan
Documents, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the proceeds of
any foreclosure, as collateral for the payment of any amounts due or to become
due under or in respect of such Letters of Credit and/or such Bankers'
Acceptances. Such Proceeds of Remedies shall be held for the ratable benefit of
the U.S. Lenders, the Canadian Lenders or U.K. Lenders, as the case may be. The
rights, titles, benefits, privileges, duties and obligations of the applicable
Agent with respect thereto shall be governed by the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, the
applicable Security Documents. The applicable Agent may, but shall have no
obligation to, invest any such Proceeds of Remedies in such manner as such
Agent, in the exercise of its sole discretion, deems appropriate. Such Proceeds
of Remedies shall be applied to Reimbursement Obligations arising in respect of
any such Letters of Credit, the payment of any Lender's obligations under any
such Letter of Credit and/or the Obligations relating to any such Bankers'
Acceptance when such Letter of Credit is drawn upon or such Bankers' Acceptance
matures, as the case may be. Nothing in this Section shall cause or permit an
increase in the maximum amount of the Obligations permitted to be outstanding
from time to time under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, any amounts realized
under this Section which constitute an asset of any Foreign Subsidiary shall
only be applied to the payment of Canadian Obligations or U.K. Obligations.

        9.5  Currency Conversion After Maturity. At any time following the
occurrence of an Event of Default and the acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations owed to the Canadian Lenders hereunder, the Canadian Lenders shall
be entitled to convert, with two (2) Business Days' prior notice to Canadian
Borrower, any and all or any part of the then unpaid and outstanding LIBOR
Borrowings and Base Rate Borrowings of the Canadian Borrower to Canadian Prime
Loans. Any such conversion shall be calculated so that the resulting Canadian
Prime Loans shall be the equivalent on the date of conversion of the amount of
Dollars so converted. Any accrued and unpaid interest denominated in Dollars at
the time of any such conversion shall be similarly converted to Canadian
Dollars, and such Canadian Prime Loans and accrued and unpaid interest thereon
shall thereafter bear interest in accordance with the terms hereof.

        9.6  Remedies Cumulative. No remedy, right or power conferred upon any
Agent or any Lender is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, right or
power given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, or
otherwise, and all such remedies, rights and powers shall be cumulative.

10.     Agents.

        10.1 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each U.S. Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes U.S. Agent to act as its agent hereunder,
under the U.S. Letters of Credit
<PAGE>
and under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically
delegated to U.S. Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Canadian Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes Canadian Agent to act as its agent
hereunder, under the Canadian Letters of Credit and under the other Loan
Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to Canadian Agent by
the terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Each U.K. Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes
U.K. Agent to act as its agent hereunder, under the U.K. Letters of Credit and
under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to
U.K. Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Any Loan Documents executed in favor of any
Agent shall be held by such Agent for the ratable benefit of the applicable
Lenders. None of the Agents ("Agents" as used in this Section 10 shall include
reference to their Affiliates and their own and their Affiliates' respective
officers, shareholders, directors, employees and agents) (a) shall have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement,
the Letters of Credit, and the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document be a trustee or fiduciary for any
Lender; (b) shall be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, the Letters of Credit
or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement, the
Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document, or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, execution, filing, registration,
collectibility, recording, perfection, existence or sufficiency of this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit, or any other Loan Document or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or therein or any Property covered
thereby or for any failure by any Obligor or any other Person to perform any of
its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or shall have any duty to inquire into
or pass upon any of the foregoing matters; (c) shall be required to initiate or
conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under the Letters
of Credit or any other Loan Document except to the extent requested and
adequately indemnified by the Majority Lenders; (d) shall be responsible for any
mistake of law or fact or any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
hereunder or under the Letters or Credit or any other Loan Document or any other
document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in
connection herewith or therewith, including, without limitation, pursuant to its
own negligence, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct; (e)
shall be bound by or obliged to recognize any agreement among or between any
Borrower and any Lender to which such Agent is not a party, regardless of
whether such Agent has knowledge of the existence of any such agreement or the
terms and provisions thereof; (f) shall be charged with notice or knowledge of
any fact or information not herein set out or provided to such Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (g)
shall be responsible for any delay, error, omission or default of any mail,
telegraph, cable or wireless agency or operator, and (h) shall be responsible
for the acts or edicts of any Governmental Authority. Any Agent may employ
agents and attorneys-in-fact and none of the Agents shall be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it
with reasonable care. Without in any way limiting any of the foregoing, each
Lender acknowledges that none of the Agents (nor any Issuer) shall have greater
responsibility in the operation of the Letters of Credit than is specified in
the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision,
International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500). In any foreclosure
proceeding concerning any Collateral, each holder of an Obligation if bidding
for its own account or for its own account and the accounts of other Lenders is
prohibited from including in
<PAGE>
the amount of its bid an amount to be applied as a credit against the
Obligations held by it or the Obligations held by the other Lenders; instead,
such holder must bid in cash only. However, in any such foreclosure proceeding,
(i) U.S. Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) submit a bid for all U.S.
Lenders (including itself) in the form of a credit against the U.S. Obligations,
and U.S. Agent or its designee may (but shall not be obligated to) accept title
to such collateral for and on behalf of all U.S. Lenders, (ii) Canadian Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to) submit a bid for all Canadian Lenders
(including itself) in the form of a credit against the Canadian Obligations, and
Canadian Agent or its designee may (but shall not be obligated to) accept title
to such collateral for and on behalf of all Canadian Lenders and (iii) U.K.
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) submit a bid for all U.K. Lenders
(including itself) in the form of a credit against the U.K. Obligations, and
U.K. Agent or its designee may (but shall not be obligated to) accept title to
such collateral for and on behalf of all U.K. Lenders.

        10.2  Reliance. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by
telephone, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and
upon advice and statements of legal counsel (which may be counsel for any
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent.
None of the Agents shall be required in any way to determine the identity or
authority of any Person delivering or executing the same. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Letters of Credit, or any other
Loan Document, each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, hereunder and thereunder in accordance with instructions
of the Majority Lenders, and any action taken or failure to act by U.S. Agent
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the U.S. Lenders, any action taken
or failure to act by Canadian Agent pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of
the Canadian Lenders and any action taken or failure to act by U.K. Agent
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the U.K. Lenders. Pursuant to
written instructions of the Majority Lenders, the Agents shall have the
authority to execute releases of the Security Documents on behalf of the Lenders
without the joinder of any Lender. If any order, writ, judgment or decree shall
be made or entered by any court affecting the rights, duties and obligations of
any Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then and in any of
such events such Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and
comply with such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it under the terms of this
Agreement, the relevant Loan Document or otherwise; and if such Agent complies
with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, then it shall not be liable to
any Lender or to any other Person by reason of such compliance even though such
order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

        10.3  Defaults. None of the Agents shall be deemed to have knowledge of
the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment of principal of or
interest on Loans or Reimbursement Obligations) unless such Agent has received
notice from a Lender or a Borrower specifying such Default and stating that such
notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that any Agent receives such a
Notice of Default, such Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders
(and shall give each Lender prompt notice of each such non-payment). Each Agent
shall (subject to Section 10.7 hereof) take such action with respect to such
Notice of Default as shall be directed by the Majority Lenders and within its
rights under the Loan Documents and at law or in equity, provided that, unless
and until an Agent shall have received such directions,
<PAGE>
such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain
from taking such action, permitted hereby with respect to such Notice of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders and
within its rights under the Loan Documents, at law or in equity.

        10.4  Material Written Notices. In the event that any Agent receives any
written notice of a material nature from any Borrower or any Obligor under the
Loan Documents, such Agent shall promptly inform each of the Lenders thereof.

        10.5  Rights as a Lender. With respect to their U.S. Commitments,
Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments, as the case may be, and the
Obligations, each of Wells Fargo, HSBC Canada and HSBC U.K., in its capacity as
a Lender hereunder, shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting in its agency
capacity, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise
indicates, include each Agent in its individual capacity. Each Agent may
(without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend
money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, letter of credit,
agency or other business with any Borrower (and any of their Affiliates) as if
it were not acting as an Agent, and each Agent may accept fees and other
consideration from any Borrower (in addition to the fees heretofore agreed to
between any Borrower and any Agent) for services in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

        10.6  Indemnification. The Canadian Lenders, the U.S. Lenders and U.K.
Lenders, respectively, agree to indemnify Canadian Agent, U.S. Agent and U.K.
Agent, respectively (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 2.2(c), Section
11.3 or Section 11.4 hereof, but without limiting the obligations of any
Borrower under said Sections 2.2(c), 11.3 and 11.4), ratably in accordance with
the sum of the applicable Lenders' respective U.S. Commitments, Canadian
Commitments, U.K. Commitments and Term Loans, for any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES,
which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the applicable Agent in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or
any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including,
without limitation, the costs and expenses which any Borrower is obligated to
pay under Sections 2.2(c), 11.3 and 11.4 hereof, interest, penalties, attorneys'
fees and amounts paid in settlement, but excluding, unless a Default has
occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to
the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the
terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents; provided that no Lender
shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified. The obligations
of the Lenders under this Section 10.6 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations.

        10.7  Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender agrees that
it has received current financial information with respect to each Borrower and
each other Obligor and that it has, independently and without reliance on any
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of
<PAGE>
each Borrower and each other Obligor and decision to enter into this
Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents. None of the Agents shall be required to keep itself informed as to
the performance or observance by any Obligor of this Agreement, the Letters of
Credit or any of the other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of any
Obligor. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by an Agent hereunder, under
the Letters of Credit or the other Loan Documents, none of the Agents shall have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of any
Obligor (or any of their affiliates) which may come into the possession of any
Agent.

        10.8  Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of an Agent
hereunder, under the Letters of Credit or under the other Loan Documents, each
Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act
hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its
satisfaction by the Lenders of their indemnification obligations under Section
10.6 hereof against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by
it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

        10.9  Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor U.S. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case
may be, as provided below, U.S. Agent, Canadian Agent and U.K. Agent,
respectively, may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the U.S.
Lenders, the Canadian Lenders and U.K. Lenders, respectively, and to U.S.
Borrower, Canadian Borrower and U.K. Borrower, respectively. Any Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders; provided,
that such Agent shall continue as U.S. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as
the case may be, until such time as any successor shall have accepted
appointment hereunder as U.S. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case
may be. Upon any such resignation or removal, (i) the Majority Lenders without
the consent of any Borrower shall have the right to appoint a successor U.S.
Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case may be, so long as such
successor U.S. Agent , Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case may be, is also
a Lender at the time of such appointment and (ii) the Majority Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor U.S. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent,
as the case may be, that is not a Lender at the time of such appointment so long
as Borrowers consent to such appointment (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If no successor U.S. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K.
Agent, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders
and accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring U.S. Agent's,
Canadian Agent's or U.K. Agent's, as the case may be, giving of notice of
resignation or the Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring U.S. Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case may be, then the retiring Agent may,
on behalf of the applicable Lenders, appoint a successor U.S. Agent, Canadian
Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case may be, without the necessity of any consent on
the part of any Borrower or any Lender. Any successor U.S. Agent shall be a bank
which has an office in the United States and a combined capital and surplus of
at least $250,000,000, any successor Canadian Agent shall be a bank which has an
office in Canada and a combined capital and surplus of at least C$250,000,000
and any successor U.K. Agent shall be a bank which has an office in the United
<PAGE>
Kingdom and a combined capital and surplus of at least (pound)100,000,000. Upon
the acceptance of any appointment as U.S. Agent, Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent,
as the case may be, hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations hereunder and under any other Loan Documents. Such
successor Agent shall promptly specify by notice to Borrowers its Principal
Office referred to in Section 3.1 and Section 4 hereof. After any retiring
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this
Section 10 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

        10.10 No Partnership. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor any of the other Loan Documents nor any interest the Lenders,
Agents or any of them may now or hereafter have in all or any part of the
Obligations shall create or be construed as creating a partnership, joint
venture or other joint enterprise between the Lenders or among the Lenders and
any Agent. The relationship between the Lenders, on the one hand, and any Agent,
on the other, is and shall be that of principals and agent only, and nothing in
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be construed to
constitute any Agent as trustee or other fiduciary for any Lender or to impose
on any Agent any duty, responsibility or obligation other than those expressly
provided for herein and therein.

        10.11 Authority of Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that the rights and
responsibilities of each Agent under this Agreement and the Loan Documents with
respect to any action taken by such Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by any
Agent of any option, right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided
for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement and/or the other Loan
Documents shall, as between such Agent and the Lenders, be governed by this
Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from
time to time among them, but, as between such Agent and the Obligors, such Agent
shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the applicable Lenders
with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting; and each Obligor
shall not be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry
respecting such authority.

        10.12 Syndications Agent. Comerica Bank, in its capacity as Syndications
Agent, shall have no rights, powers, duties, obligations or liabilities under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, but to the extent that for
any reason any Person makes a claim against Comerica Bank in its capacity as
Syndications Agent and not as a Lender the indemnification provisions in
Sections 10.6 and 11.4 shall apply in connection with such claim as if Comerica
Bank was an Agent under this Agreement.
<PAGE>
11.     Miscellaneous.

        11.1  Waiver. No waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall be a
waiver of any other Default or Event of Default. No failure on the part of any
Agent or any Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of
dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under any Loan Document
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, power or privilege thereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies
provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law or in equity.

        11.2  Notices. All notices and other communications provided for herein
(including, without limitation, any modifications of, or waivers or consents
under, this Agreement) shall be given or made by telegraph, telecopy (confirmed
by mail), cable or other writing and telecopied, telegraphed, cabled, mailed or
delivered to the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices" specified below
its name on the signature pages hereof (or provided for in an Assignment and
Acceptance); or, as to any party hereto, at such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a notice (given in accordance with this Section) (i)
as to any Borrower, to Agents, (ii) as to U.S. Agent, to U.S. Borrower and to
each U.S. Lender, (iii) as to Canadian Agent, to Canadian Borrower and to each
Canadian Lender, (iv) as to U.K. Agent, to U.K. Borrower and to each U.K.

Canadian Lender, to Canadian Borrower and Agents and (vii) as to any U.K.
Lender, to U.K. Borrower and Agents. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all such notices or communications shall be deemed to have been duly
given when (a) transmitted by telecopier or delivered to the telegraph or cable
office, (b) personally delivered (c) one Business Day after deposit with an
overnight mail or delivery service, postage prepaid or (d) three Business Days'
after deposit in a receptacle maintained by the United States Postal Service or
Canada Post or the official postal service of the United Kingdom, as the case
may be, postage prepaid, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,
in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

        11.3  Expenses, Etc. Whether or not any Loan is ever made or any

modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement, the

and customary search fees, collateral audit fees and appraisal fees; (c) any
Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the

any Agent for paying all costs, expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges
incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of
any Lien contemplated by this Agreement, any Security Document or any document
referred to herein or therein; and (f) following the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, any Lender or any Agent for paying all
amounts reasonably expended, advanced or incurred by such Lender or such Agent
to satisfy any obligation of any Obligor under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, to protect the Collateral, to collect the Obligations or to enforce,
protect, preserve or defend the rights of the Lenders or Agents under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with such Lender's or such Agent's participation
as a member of a creditor's committee in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy
Code or the Insolvency Act 1986 (England and Wales) or other similar law, fees
and expenses incurred in connection with lifting the automatic stay prescribed
in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or the Insolvency Act 1986 (England and
Wales) and fees and expenses incurred in connection with any action pursuant to

such Lender or such Agent in connection with such matters, together with
interest thereon at the Past Due Rate applicable to U.S. Loans on each such
amount from the due date until the date of reimbursement to such Lender or such
Agent.

        11.4  Indemnification. Borrowers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify
each Agent, each Lender and each affiliate thereof and their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents from, and hold each of them harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them
may become subject, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, insofar as such losses, liabilities,
claims or damages arise out of or result from any (i) actual or proposed use by
any Borrower of the proceeds of any extension of credit (whether a Loan, a
Bankers' Acceptance or a Letter of Credit) by any Lender hereunder; (ii) breach
by any Obligor of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iii) violation by
any Obligor of any Legal Requirement; or (iv) investigation, litigation or other
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, and Borrowers, jointly and
severally, shall reimburse each Agent, each Lender, and each Affiliate thereof
and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand for
any reasonable and customary expenses (including reasonable and customary legal
fees) incurred in connection with any such investigation or proceeding;
provided, however, that none of the Borrowers shall have any obligations
pursuant to this Section with respect to any losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses incurred by the Person seeking indemnification by reason of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Person or with respect to any
disputes between or among any of Agents, Lenders and Issuers. Nothing in this
Section is intended to limit the obligations of any Borrower under any other
provision of this Agreement. Each Agent and each Lender, respectively, shall
indemnify Borrowers and hold Borrowers harmless from and against the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or such Lender, as the case may
be. Nothing in this Section shall render Canadian Borrower or U.K. Borrower
liable in respect of the U.S. Obligations. In the case of any indemnification
hereunder, the applicable Agent or the respective Lender, as appropriate, shall
give written notice to the applicable Borrower of any such claim or demand being
made against an indemnified person and the applicable Borrower shall have the
non-exclusive right to join in the defense against any such
<PAGE>
claim or demand, provided that if such Borrower provides a defense, the
indemnified person shall bear its own cost of defense unless there is a conflict
of interests between such Borrower and such indemnified person. No indemnified
person may settle any claim to be indemnified without the consent of the
applicable Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

        11.5  Amendments, Etc. No amendment or modification of this Agreement,
the Notes or any other Loan Document shall in any event be effective against any
Borrower or any other Obligor party thereto unless the same shall be agreed or
consented to in writing by such Person. No amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor any
consent to any departure by any Obligor therefrom, shall in any event be
effective against the Lenders unless the same shall be agreed or consented to in
writing by the Majority Lenders, and each such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given; provided, that no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by each Lender affected thereby, do any of the
following: (a) increase any U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K.
Commitments of any of the Lenders (or reinstate any termination or reduction of
the U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments), or subject any
of the Lenders to any additional obligations; (b) reduce the principal of, or
interest on, any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation, fee or other amount due
hereunder; (c) postpone or extend the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, the Term
Loan Maturity Date, the Termination Date, the Availability Period or any
scheduled date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Loan,
Reimbursement Obligation, fee or other sum to be paid hereunder or waive any
Event of Default described in Section 9.1(a) hereof; (d) change the percentage
of any of the U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments, as the
case may be, or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Obligations, or the
percentage of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to
take any action under this Agreement; (e) change any provision contained in
Sections 2.2(c), 7.9, 11.3 or 11.4 hereof or this Section 11.5; (f) release any
Person from liability under a Guaranty or release all or substantially all of
the security for the Obligations or release Collateral (exclusive of Collateral
with respect to which any Agent is obligated to provide a release pursuant to
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or by law) in any one (1)
calendar year ascribed an aggregate value on the most recent financial
statements of the applicable Borrower delivered to Agents in excess of
$1,000,000; (g) increase any of the fixed percentages to be multiplied by the
aggregate amounts of the components comprising the U.S. Borrowing Base, the
Canadian Borrowing Base or U.K. Borrowing Base that are described in (i) and
(ii) of the definition of the U.S. Borrowing Base, the Canadian Borrowing Base
or U.K. Borrowing Base herein, and (h) modify the provisions of Sections 4.1(b)
or 4.2 hereof regarding pro rata application of amounts after an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 11.5 to the contrary, no amendment, modification, waiver or consent
shall be made with respect to Section 10 without the consent of U.S. Agent to
the extent it affects U.S. Agent, as U.S. Agent or Canadian Agent to the extent
it affects Canadian Agent, as Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent to the extent it
affects U.K. Agent, as U.K. Agent.

        11.6  Successors and Assigns.

        (a)   This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
Borrowers, Agents and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns;
provided, however, that, except as permitted by Section 8.4 hereof, no Borrower
may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of all of the Lenders, and any such assignment or transfer
without such consent shall be null and void. Each Lender may sell participations
to any Person in all or part of any Loan or Bankers' Acceptance, or all or part
of its Notes, U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments, as the
case may be, or interests in Letters of Credit or Bankers' Acceptances, in which
event, without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of the Loan Documents
shall inure to the benefit of each purchaser of a participation; provided,
however, the pro rata treatment of payments, as described in Section 4.2 hereof
and rights to compensation under Section 3.3 hereof, shall be determined as if
such Lender had not sold such participation. No Lender that sells one or more
participations to any Person shall be relieved by virtue of such participation
from any of its obligations to Borrowers under this Agreement. In the event any
Lender shall sell any participation, such Lender shall retain the sole right and
responsibility to enforce the obligations of Borrowers hereunder, including,
without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement other than amendments, modifications or
waivers with respect to (i) any fees payable hereunder to the Lenders, (ii) the
amount of principal or the rate of interest payable on, or the dates fixed for
the scheduled repayment of principal of, any of the Obligations and (iii) the
release of the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral.

        (b)   Each U.S. Lender may assign to one or more U.S. Lenders or any
other Person all or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) the aggregate amount of the U.S.
Commitments and Term Loans of the assigning U.S. Lender subject to each such
assignment shall in no event be less than $3,000,000 and (ii) other than in the
case of an assignment to another U.S. Lender (that is, at the time of the
assignment, a party hereto) or to a Lender Affiliate of such U.S. Lender or to a
Federal Reserve Bank, Agents and, so long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, U.S. Borrower must each give its prior written
consent, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each Canadian Lender
may assign to one or more Canadian Lenders or any other Person all or a portion
of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided,
however, that (i) the aggregate amount of the Canadian Commitments of the
assigning Canadian Lender subject to each such assignment shall in no event be
less than $3,000,000 and (ii) other than in the case of an assignment to another
Canadian Lender (that is, at the time of the assignment, a party hereto) or to a
Lender Affiliate of such Canadian Lender, Agents and, so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Canadian Borrower must each give
its prior written consent, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Each U.K. Lender may assign to one or more U.K. Lenders or any other Person all
or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that (x) the aggregate amount of the U.K. Commitments of the
assigning U.K. Lender subject to each such assignment shall in no event be less
than $3,000,000 and (y) other than in the case of an assignment to another U.K.
Lender (that is, at the time of the assignment, a party hereto) or to a Lender
Affiliate of such U.K. Lender, Agents and, so long as no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, U.K. Borrower must each give its prior written
consent, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld. After giving effect
to any assignment (other than an assignment of all of the
<PAGE>
commitments and Loans of the assigning Lender), the assigning Lender shall
have commitments and Loans aggregating at least $3,000,000 unless otherwise
agreed to by the U.S. Borrower and the U.S. Agent. As a condition precedent
to any such assignment, the parties to each such assignment shall execute and
deliver to the applicable Agent, for its acceptance an Assignment and Acceptance
in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto (each an "Assignment and
Acceptance") with blanks appropriately completed, together with any Note or
Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and recording fee of $3,000
paid by the assignee (for which Borrowers will have no liability). Upon such
execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Acceptance, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (B) the Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto except in respect of provisions of this Agreement which survive payment
of the Obligations and termination of the U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments
or U.K. Commitments, as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, any Lender may at any time assign all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
collateral to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such assignment shall
release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.

        (c)   By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than the
representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim, such Lender
assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; (ii) such Lender assignor makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of any Borrower or any Obligor or the performance or
observance by any Borrower or any Obligor of any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the
financial statements most recently delivered under either Section 6.2 or Section
7.2 hereof and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate
to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent, such Lender assignor or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes U.S. Agent,
Canadian Agent or U.K. Agent, as the case may be, to take such action as agent
on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all obligations that by the
<PAGE>
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be
performed by it as a Lender.

        (d)   The entries in the records of each applicable Agent as to each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and the names and addresses of the
Lenders and the U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or U.K. Commitments of,
and principal amount of the Obligations owing to, each Lender from time to time
shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Obligors, Agents and
the Lenders may treat each Person the name of which is recorded in the books and
records of the applicable Agent as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

        (e)   Upon the applicable Agent's receipt of an Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and the assignee thereunder, together
with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and the written consent to
such assignment (to the extent consent is required), such Agent shall, if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed with blanks appropriately filled,
(i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in its records and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the applicable
Borrower. Within five Business Days after receipt of notice, the applicable
Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the applicable Agent
new Notes payable to the order of such assignee in the appropriate amounts and,
if the assigning Lender has retained U.S. Commitments, Canadian Commitments or
U.K. Commitments, as the case may be, or Term Loans hereunder, new Notes to the
order of the assigning Lender in the appropriate amounts. Such new Notes shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be in the forms required hereunder. Thereafter, the replaced Notes
shall be surrendered to the applicable Agent by the applicable Lender or
Lenders, marked renewed and substituted and the originals thereof delivered to
the applicable Borrower (with copies to be retained by the applicable Agent).

        (f)   Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation
or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 11.6, disclose
to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any
information relating to any Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of
any Borrower; provided such Person agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
such information in accordance with Section 11.19.

        11.7  Limitation of Interest. U.S. Borrower, U.K. Borrower, U.S. Lenders
and U.K. Lenders intend to strictly comply with all applicable usury laws of the
United States and Texas (or the usury laws of any jurisdiction, including Canada
and the United Kingdom, whose usury laws are deemed to apply to the Notes or any
other Loan Documents despite the intention and desire of the parties to apply
the usury laws of the State of Texas). Canadian Borrower and the Canadian
Lenders intend to strictly comply with all applicable usury laws in effect in
Canada (or the usury laws of any jurisdiction, including the State of Texas,
whose usury laws are deemed to apply to the Notes or any other Loan Documents
despite the intention and desire of the parties to apply the usury laws in
effect in Canada). Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 11.7 shall govern
and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section, even if such
provision declares that it controls. As used in this Section, the term
"interest" includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other
compensation which constitute interest under applicable law, provided that, to
<PAGE>
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment
shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than
the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as interest and (b) all
interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread during the full term of the
Obligations. In no event shall Borrowers or any other Person be obligated to
pay, or any Agent, any Issuer or any Lender have any right or privilege to
reserve, receive or retain, (a) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of
nonusurious interest permitted under applicable laws or (b) total interest in
excess of the amount which such Person could lawfully have contracted for,
reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated for the
full term of the Obligations at the Ceiling Rate. None of the terms and
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document (including,
without limitation, Section 9.1 hereof) which directly or indirectly relate to
interest shall ever be construed without reference to this Section 11.7, or be
construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of
money at an interest rate in excess of the Ceiling Rate. If the term of any
Obligation is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any
Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted
prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Agent, any Issuer or any
Lender at any time, including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed
or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at
the Ceiling Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest
shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment
or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been
paid to such Person, it shall be credited pro tanto against the then-outstanding
principal balance of the applicable Borrower's obligations to such Person,
effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be
excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has
been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance
of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.

        11.8  Survival. The obligations of Borrowers under Sections 2.2(c),
2.2(d), 7.9, 11.3 and 11.4 hereof and all other obligations of Borrowers in any
other Loan Document (to the extent stated therein), the obligations of each
Issuer under the last sentence of Section 2.2(b)(iii) and the obligations of the
Lenders under Sections 4.1(d), 10.6, 11.7, 11.13, 11.18 and 11.19 hereof, shall,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, survive the repayment of the
Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and the termination of the U.S. Commitments,
the Canadian Commitments, the U.K. Commitments and the Letters of Credit.

        11.9  Captions. Captions and section headings appearing herein are
included solely for convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

        11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing
any such counterpart.

        11.11 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND (EXCEPT AS THEREIN PROVIDED) THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FROM TIME
TO TIME IN EFFECT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT, EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED UNDER
APPLICABLE
<PAGE>
LAWS, THE USURY LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS OR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LOANS MADE TO AND BANKERS ACCEPTANCES ACCEPTED IN CANADA
BY CANADIAN LENDERS DRAWN BY CANADIAN BORROWER, BUT RATHER THE USURY LAWS IN
EFFECT IN CANADA SHALL GOVERN IN SUCH CONTEXT.

        11.12 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of the Loan
Documents shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law. If any provision of any Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of such Loan Document shall not
be affected or impaired thereby.

        11.13 Tax Forms; Net Payments.

        (a)   Each U.S. Lender which is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall, on the day of the initial
borrowing from each such U.S. Lender hereunder and from time to time thereafter
if requested by U.S. Borrower or U.S. Agent, provide U.S. Agent and U.S.
Borrower with the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United
States certifying as to such U.S. Lender's status for purposes of determining
exemption from United States withholding taxes with respect to all payments to
be made to such U.S. Lender hereunder or other documents satisfactory to such
U.S. Lender, U.S. Borrower and U.S. Agent indicating that all payments to be
made to such U.S. Lender hereunder are not subject to United States withholding
tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty.
Unless U.S. Borrower and U.S. Agent shall have received such forms or such
documents indicating that payments to such U.S. Lender hereunder are not subject
to United States withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by
an applicable tax treaty, U.S. Borrower and U.S. Agent shall be entitled to
withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate.

        (b)   Each Canadian Lender is not a non-resident of Canada for purposes
of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

        (c)   Each U.K. Lender is a Qualifying Lender. In this Section 11.13(c),
"Qualifying Lender" means (a) a Lender which is within the charge to U.K.
corporation tax in respect of, and beneficially entitled to, a payment of
interest on a loan made by a person that was a bank for the purposes of section
349 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (as currently defined in
section 840A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act) at the time the loan was
made, or (b) a Lender which is, on the date a payment of interest falls due
hereunder, resident (as defined in the appropriate double taxation agreement) in
a country with which the U.K. has a double taxation agreement giving residents
of that country exemption from U.K. taxation on interest and does not carry on a
business in the U.K. through a permanent establishment with which the payment is
effectively connected.

        (d)   Each U.K. Lender shall (i) promptly after the date hereof or
promptly after the date of an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
became a Lender and (ii) from time to time thereafter upon the obsolescence or
expiration of any previously delivered form or certificate (but only so long as
such Lender remains lawfully able to do so) provide the
<PAGE>
Borrowers and the Agents with any form or certificate that is required by any
taxing authority, or other such forms as shall be appropriate to establish,
that such Lender is (y) exempt from Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Each U.K. Lender
represents and warrants that such information is true and complete in all
material respects as of the date it is delivered. Each such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrowers and the Agents if, because of any change in the
jurisdiction of organization or the principle office of such Lender, (A) it is
required to withdraw or cancel any form or certificate previously submitted by
it or any form or certificate has otherwise become ineffective or inaccurate or
(B) payments to it are or will be subject to withholding of any Home
Jurisdiction Withholding Tax to a greater or lesser extent than the extent to
which payments to it pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document were previously subject.

        (e)   If a Lender shall receive a refund of any Taxes paid by a Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement by reason of the fact that such Taxes were not
correctly or legally asserted, such Lender shall within 90 days after receipt of
such refund pay to such Borrower the amount of such refund along with any
interest actually received by such Lender thereon, if any; provided, however,
that such payments shall be required only to the extent any Lender can
determine, in its good faith judgment, that such refunds are attributable to
payments made by or on behalf of such Borrower; and provided, further, that no
Lender shall have any obligation under this Agreement to claim or otherwise seek
to obtain any such refund, but agrees to use reasonable efforts to assist a
Borrower in doing so.

        11.14 Interest Act (Canada). Whenever interest is calculated on the
basis of a year of 360 or 365 days, for the purposes of the Interest Act
(Canada), the yearly rate of interest which is equivalent to the rate payable
hereunder is the rate payable multiplied by the actual number of days in the
year and divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be. All interest will be
calculated using the nominal rate method and not the effective rate method and
the deemed reinvestment principle shall not apply to such calculations.

        11.15 Judgment Currency. The obligation of each Borrower to make
payments on any Obligation to the Lenders or to any Agent hereunder in any
currency (the "first currency") shall not be discharged or satisfied by any
tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any
other currency (the "second currency") except to the extent to which such tender
or recovery shall result in the effective receipt by the applicable Lender or
the applicable Agent of the full amount of the first currency payable, and
accordingly the primary obligation of each Borrower shall be enforceable as an
alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovery in the
second currency of the amount (if any) by which such effective receipt shall
fall short of the full amount of the first currency payable and shall not be
affected by a judgment being obtained for any other sum due hereunder.

        11.16 Conflicts Between This Agreement and the Other Loan Documents. In
the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of
any of the other Loan Documents, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

        11.17 Limitation on Charges; Substitute Lenders; Non-Discrimination.
Anything in Sections 2.2(d), 3.3(c) or 7.9 notwithstanding:
<PAGE>
              (1) No Borrower shall be required to pay to any Lender
        reimbursement or indemnification with regard to any costs or expenses
        described in such Sections, unless such Lender notifies the applicable
        Borrower of such costs or expenses within 90 days after the date paid
        or incurred;

              (2) none of the Lenders shall be permitted to pass through to
        any Borrower charges and costs under such Sections on a discriminatory
        basis (i.e., which are not also passed through by such Lender to other
        customers of such Lender similarly situated where such customer is
        subject to documents providing for such pass through); and

              (3) if any Lender elects to pass through to any Borrower any
        material charge or cost under such Sections or elects to terminate the
        availability of LIBOR Borrowings for any material period of time, the
