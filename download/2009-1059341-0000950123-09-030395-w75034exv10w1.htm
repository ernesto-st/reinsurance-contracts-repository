shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or transfer of all or part of an Advance
evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration
of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Advance, accompanied by a duly
executed Assignment and Assumption; thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate
principal amount shall be issued to the designated Eligible Assignee, and the old Notes
shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked &#147;canceled&#148;. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Lender (with respect to any
entry relating to such Lender&#146;s Advances) or any Issuing Bank (with respect to any entry

Eligible Assignee (and, in any case where the consent of any other Person is required by
Section&nbsp;10.06(c), by each such other Person) together with payment to the Administrative
Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500 (if required by the Administrative
Agent and, in any case treating multiple, simultaneous assignments by or to two or more
Related Funds as a single assignment), the Administrative Agent shall (i)&nbsp;promptly accept
such Assignment and Assumption and (ii)&nbsp;on the effective date determined pursuant thereto
record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance
and recordation to the Borrower. On or prior to such effective date, the Borrower, at its
own expense, upon request, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (in
exchange for the Revolving Note, PIK Obligation Notes and/or applicable Term Notes, as the
case may be, of the assigning Lender) a new Revolving Note, PIK Obligation Note and/or
applicable Term Notes, as the case may be, to the order of such Eligible Assignee and its
registered assigns in an amount equal to the Revolving Commitment and/or applicable Term
Advances, as the case may be, assumed or acquired by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Assumption and, if the Assignor has retained a Revolving Commitment, PIK Obligation and/or
Term Advances, as the case may be, upon request, a new Revolving Note, PIK Obligation Note
and/or Term Notes, as the case may be, to the order of the Assignor and its registered
assigns in an amount equal to the Revolving Commitment, PIK Obligation and/or applicable
Term Advances, as the case may be, retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall
be dated the Effective Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Note or Notes replaced
thereby.

absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit assignments creating security
interests in Advances and Notes, including any pledge or assignment by a Lender of any Loan
or Note to (i)&nbsp;any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable law, (ii)&nbsp;any holder
of, or trustee for the benefit of, the holders of such Lender&#146;s securities or (iii)&nbsp;any SPC

Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; <U>provided</U> that (i)&nbsp;nothing herein shall
constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Advance and (ii)&nbsp;if an SPC elects not to
exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the
Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof. The
making of a Advance by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender
to the same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by such Granting Lender. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment
obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting
Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year
and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other
indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in

the execution and performance of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to contract in
strict compliance with applicable usury laws, including conflicts of law concepts, governing the
Advances of each Lender including such applicable laws of the State of New York and the United
States of America from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof, the Lenders and the
Borrower stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or
the other Credit Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration
for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate
and that for purposes hereof &#147;interest&#148; shall include the aggregate of all charges which constitute
interest under such laws that are contracted for, charged or received under this Agreement; and in
the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, under any circumstances the aggregate amounts taken,
reserved, charged, received or paid on the Advances, include amounts which by applicable law are
deemed interest which would exceed the Maximum Rate, then such excess shall be deemed to be a
mistake and each Lender receiving same shall credit the same on the principal of its Advances (or
if such Advances shall have been paid in full, refund said excess to the Borrower). In the event
that the maturity of the Advances is accelerated by reason of any election of the holder thereof
resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any
required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never
include more than the Maximum Rate and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or
otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if
theretofore paid, shall be credited on the applicable Advances (or, if the applicable Advances
shall have been paid in full, refunded to the Borrower). In determining whether or not the
interest paid or payable under any specific contingencies exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Borrower
and the Lenders shall to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law amortize, prorate,
allocate and spread in equal parts during the period of the full term of the Advances all amounts
