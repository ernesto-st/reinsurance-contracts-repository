<B><U>Introduction</U></B>. <B>PMA Capital Corporation</B> (then known as
the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Corporation) (the &#147;Plan Sponsor&#148;)
previously established the <B>PMA Capital Corporation Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan</B> (then known as the PMC Executive Deferred Compensation
Plan) (the &#147;Deferred Compensation Plan&#148;) to provide certain benefits
in excess of the benefit provided under the <B>PMA Capital Corporation 401(k)
Plan</B> (then known as The PMC 401(k) Plan) (the &#147;Qualified Plan&#148;).
The Plan Sponsor has decided to provide certain benefits previously provided
under the Deferred Compensation Plan in a separate plan to be known as the<B>
PMA Capital Corporation 401(k) Excess Plan</B> (the &#147;Plan&#148;), as set
forth herein, and has restated the Deferred Compensation Plan to, among other
things, reflect the removal from the Deferred Compensation Plan of those
provisions set forth herein. </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan is
established for the purpose of providing certain employees of the Plan Sponsor
and certain of its affiliated employers with certain benefits that would be
provided under the Qualified Plan but for the limitations imposed by Sections
401(k), 401(m), 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Plan is intended to be an unfunded arrangement, maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group
of management and/or highly compensated employees of the Plan Sponsor and its
affiliated employers within the meaning of Sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. </P>

<B><U>Funding</U></B><U></U>. Nothing contained in this Plan and no action taken
pursuant to this Plan will create or be construed to create or require a funded
arrangement or any kind of fiduciary duty between the Plan Sponsor and/or the
Administrator and a Participant. Benefits payable under this Plan to a
Participant or Beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid directly by the Plan
Sponsor from a grantor trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;) within the meaning of
Section 671 of the Code, to the extent that such benefits are not paid from the
general assets of the Plan Sponsor or other Participating Company. The Trust
must be an irrevocable grantor trust, the assets of which are subject to the
claims of the general creditors of the Plan Sponsor in the event of its
insolvency, defined for the purposes of this provision as the Plan
Sponsor&#146;s inability to pay its debts as they become due or that the Plan
Sponsor is subject to a pending proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy
Code. Except as to any amounts paid or payable to the Trust, the Plan Sponsor
shall not be obligated to set aside, earmark or escrow any funds or other assets
to satisfy its obligations under this Plan, and the Participant and his or her
Beneficiary shall not have any property interest in any specific assets of the
Plan Sponsor other than an unsecured right to receive payments from the Plan
Sponsor as provided herein. To the extent any person acquires a right hereunder,
such right(s) shall be no greater than those of a general, unsecured creditor of
the Plan Sponsor. In the event that the amounts accumulated in the Trust are not
sufficient to pay the benefits payable under this Plan, such benefits shall be
paid directly from the general assets of the Plan Sponsor or other Participating
Company. </P>
