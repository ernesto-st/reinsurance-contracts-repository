Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of Borrower&#146;s assets exceeds and will,
immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed Borrower&#146;s total liabilities, including,
without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. Borrower&#146;s
assets do not and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably
small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does
not intend to incur debt and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments)
beyond its ability to pay such debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing
and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of
obligations of Borrower). No petition under the Bankruptcy Code or similar state bankruptcy or
insolvency law has been filed against Borrower or any constituent Person in the last seven (7)
years, and neither Borrower nor any constituent Person in the last seven (7)&nbsp;years has ever made an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or taken advantage of any insolvency act for the benefit of
debtors. Neither Borrower nor any of its constituent Persons are contemplating either the filing
of a petition by it under the Bankruptcy Code or similar state bankruptcy or insolvency law or the
liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower&#146;s assets or property, and Borrower has no
knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing of any such petition against it or such

other sums required to be paid by Borrower, as tenant under and pursuant to the provisions of each
Ground Lease, (ii)&nbsp;diligently perform and observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions of
each Ground Lease on the part of Borrower, as tenant thereunder, (iii)&nbsp;promptly notify Lender of
the giving of any notice by the landlord under the applicable Ground Lease to Borrower of any

within five (5)&nbsp;days of receipt and (iv)&nbsp;promptly notify Lender of any bankruptcy, reorganization
or insolvency of the landlord under the applicable Ground Lease or of any notice thereof, and
deliver to Lender a true copy of such notice within five (5)&nbsp;days of Borrower&#146;s receipt. Borrower
shall not, without the prior consent of Lender, surrender the leasehold estate created by the
applicable Ground Lease or terminate or cancel any Ground Lease or modify, change, supplement,
alter, amend or waive any material term of any Ground Lease, either orally or in writing, and if
Borrower shall default in the performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition of any
Ground Lease on the part of Borrower, as tenant thereunder, and shall fail to cure the same prior
to the expiration of any applicable cure period provided thereunder, Lender shall have the right,
but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any act or take any action as may
be appropriate to cause all of the terms, covenants and conditions of such Ground Lease on the part
of Borrower to be performed or observed on behalf of Borrower, to the end that the rights of
Borrower in, to and under such Ground Lease shall be kept unimpaired and free from default. If the
landlord under the applicable Ground Lease shall deliver to Lender a copy of any notice of default
under such Ground Lease, such notice shall constitute full protection to Lender for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by Lender, in good faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower shall
exercise each individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of each Ground Lease upon
demand by Lender made at any time within one (1)&nbsp;year prior to the last day upon which any such
option may be exercised, and Borrower hereby expressly authorizes and appoints Lender its
attorney-in-fact to exercise any such option in the name of and upon behalf of Borrower, which
power of attorney shall be irrevocable and shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any of the other
Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. The parties hereto acknowledge
that they were represented by competent counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and
execution of the Loan Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle
of construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower acknowledges that, with
respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors in entering into
the Loan without relying in any manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of
Lender or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it under any of the
Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the
ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them
may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or
take any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender&#146;s exercise of any such rights
or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real estate financings
and other real estate transactions and investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive
with the business of Borrower or its Affiliates.
