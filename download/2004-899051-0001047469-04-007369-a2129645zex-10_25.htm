<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allstate has determined that it is in the best interests of Allstate and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued service of Executive.

encourage Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company, and to provide Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a change of control that will satisfy the expectations of
Executive and be competitive with those of similarly situated corporations. This Agreement is intended to accomplish these objectives. </FONT></P>

recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by Sections 8.1 and 8.2, the parties agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the
damages that the Company would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations under such Sections. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of such Sections would irreparably
injure the Company. Accordingly, Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an
injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any actual breach, or threatened breach, of such provisions, and Executive hereby waives any right to assert any defense that
the Company has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach. </FONT></P>

geographical or other scope, such court may modify the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant as so modified to be enforceable. </FONT></P>
