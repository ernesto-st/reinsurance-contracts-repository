Borrower has requested that the Lenders waive the 90-day notice period set forth
in Section  2.18.  The Lenders have agreed to extend the Maturity Date and waive
the 90-day notice period upon the terms and subject to the  conditions set forth
herein.

     B.  Borrower  has further  requested  that the  Lenders  agree to amend the
pricing matrix set forth in the "Applicable Margin Percentage" definition of the
Credit  Agreement.  The Lenders  have agreed to effect such  amendment  upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.
