person serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation or
a person who serves at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, and further specifies that the indemnification set forth in
Section&nbsp;1031 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote
of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise; and Section&nbsp;1031
further empowers a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
any such persons against any liability asserted against them and incurred by
them in any such capacity, or arising out of the person&#146;s status as such,
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the person

for the Company to contractually obligate itself to indemnify present and
future directors and officers of the Company and their respective estates in a
reasonable and adequate manner and that the Company assume the responsibility
and liability for expenses and damages in connection with claims brought
whether on account of any prior, present or future alleged act, omission,

director OR a director and executive officer OR executive officer] of the
Company or its Affiliates free from undue concern for damages by reason of the
Indemnitee&#146;s decisions or actions on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates;
and the Indemnitee desires to serve, or to continue to serve, provided that the
