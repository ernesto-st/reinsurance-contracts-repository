Properties</U>. Lessor acknowledges that each of the Leased Properties is covered, and may in the future be covered, by a separate Leasehold Mortgage and that, due to the fact that the applicable law of each jurisdiction differs as to the procedures
(including, without limitation, the periods for notices of sale to be published) for the exercise by a Leasehold Mortgagee of remedies under a Leasehold Mortgage and that certain of the Leasehold Mortgages may be of Leased Properties located in
jurisdictions that are subject to anti-deficiency judgment, election of remedies and/or one-form-of-action statutes making it advisable for a Leasehold Mortgagee to exercise remedies with respect to such Leased Properties in a certain order, the
Leasehold Mortgagee may be required under applicable law to, or due to applicable remedial limitations including those described above, may reasonably elect to exercise remedies against less than all of the Leased Properties at a particular time
and/or may elect, or may be required by applicable law, to exercise remedies against the Leased Properties in a particular order. Therefore, Lessor agrees that its obligations under this <U>ARTICLE&nbsp;XXII</U> are applicable to each Leased
Property. For example, Lessor may be asked to enter into a Separate Lease with respect to less than all of the Leased Properties pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;22.7</U> and/or Lessor may be asked to approve a proposed transferee of a particular Leased

clause, allocate such delinquency pro rata among the Leased Properties based upon the respective Transferred Property Percentages applicable to the Leased Properties) and the full, faithful and punctual performance of each and all of the covenants,

Lessor pursuant to the Lease with respect to the Premises and together, to the extent the same are chargeable to Tenant under the Lease, with all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Lessor with

Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees that it shall be obligated to keep itself informed as to the status of Tenant&#146;s payment, performance and observance of the Liabilities and that Lessor shall
not be obligated to give Guarantor, and Guarantor shall not be entitled to, notice of any failure by Tenant to pay, perform or observe, as applicable, any of the Liabilities, provided, however, that Lessor agrees to accept the cure of any such
