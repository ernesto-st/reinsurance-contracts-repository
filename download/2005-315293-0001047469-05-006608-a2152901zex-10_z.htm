<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>FORM OF SEVERANCE AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aon Corporation has entered into the following Severance Agreement with eleven senior executives, including four of the named executive officers (David P. Bolger,
Donald C. Ingram, Dennis L. Mahoney and Dick P.M. Verbeek) to be listed in the proxy statement for the 2005 annual meeting of stockholders and one named executive officer (Michael D. O'Halleran)
listed in the proxy statement for the 2004 annual meeting of stockholders. The individual Severance Agreements are identical to the form of Severance Agreement, with the exception of the name of the
Executive party to the Agreement and in the case of Messrs. Mahoney and Verbeek, who are not U.S. executives, the agreements will be modified to comply with local tax and other laws. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>SEVERANCE AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is entered into as of January&nbsp;21, 2005 between Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the "Executive"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Executive currently serves as a key employee of the Company (as defined in Section&nbsp;1) and the Executive's services and knowledge are valuable to the Company in
connection with the management of one or more of the Company's principal operating facilities, divisions, departments or subsidiaries; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board (as defined in Section&nbsp;1) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to secure the Executive's continued services and
to ensure the Executive's continued dedication and objectivity in the event of any threat or occurrence of, or negotiation or other action that could lead to, or create the possibility of, a Change in
Control (as defined in Section&nbsp;1) of the Company, without concern as to whether the Executive might be hindered or distracted by personal uncertainties and risks created by any such possible
Change in Control, and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company, the Board has authorized the Company to enter into this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,

for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder
(which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment,
as determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines
that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on the Executive's applicable federal income tax return
would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in
the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been

obtain such assumption prior to the effectiveness of any such merger, consolidation or transfer of assets shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation and other
benefits from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as the Executive would be entitled hereunder if the Executive's employment were terminated following a Change in Control other than
