marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by such
Purchaser as being confidential information of the Issuer, provided that such
term does not include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known
to such Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes
publicly known through no act or omission by such Purchaser or any person acting on such Purchaser&#146;s behalf, (c)
otherwise becomes known to such Purchaser other than through disclosure by the

information of third parties delivered to such Purchaser, <i>provided</i> that
such Purchaser may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (i) its
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, trustees and affiliates (to
the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the
investment represented by its Notes), (ii) its financial advisors and other
professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential

Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent such Purchaser
may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or
appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies
under such Purchaser&#146;s Notes and this Agreement. Each holder of a Note, by its
acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be
entitled to the benefits of this <b>Section 20</b> as though it were a party to
this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Issuer in connection with the
delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such

in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Depositary. The parties to
this Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is commercially
reasonable. It is understood that the Depositary and a recipient&#146;s bank in any
funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
number provided in writing by the Person authorized by this Agreement to direct
or request the transfer to identify (i) the recipient, (ii) the recipient&#146;s
bank, and (iii) an intermediary bank. The Depositary may apply any of the funds
in a Pledged Account for any payment order it executes using any such
identifying number, even where its use may result in a Person other than the
intended recipient being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the
recipient&#146;s bank, or an intermediary bank, designated. </P>

contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Depositary shall not have any duties
or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist against the Depositary. The
Depositary shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon and to act and refrain
from acting in reliance upon any Payment Requisition, other written requisition,
notice, request, consent, certificate, order, affidavit, letter, facsimile or
other document furnished to it hereunder and reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or sent by the purported proper party; and the
Depositary shall not be liable for anything it may do or refrain from doing in
connection with its duties or obligations hereunder except as a result of its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Depositary shall not be under
any duty to give the funds deposited with it hereunder any greater degree of
care than it gives the property of its other customers and shall not be required
to invest any funds held hereunder except as directed in accordance with this
Agreement. The Depositary may consult with counsel selected by it with
reasonable care and shall not be liable for anything it may do or refrain from
doing in good faith in accordance with the written advice of such counsel. The
Depositary&#146;s duties under this Agreement are ministerial in nature. Except as
provided herein, the Depositary shall not incur any liability for (i) any act or
failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (ii) any action taken or
omitted in reliance upon any Payment Requisition, instrument, order, request,
direction or instruction that the Depositary shall in good faith believe to be
genuine. The Depositary shall not be responsible for determining and verifying
the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party
to this Agreement. The Depositary shall have no duty to risk or advance its own
funds in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of
any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is
not reasonably assured to it. All requests, directions, certificates and notices
to be furnished to the Depositary hereunder shall be in writing (which may be in
the form of electronic mail, to the extent permitted under <B>Section 8.10</B>).
The Depositary shall not be required to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance by the Issuer or any other Party under any Project Document or
Financing Document. The Depositary shall not be responsible for the provisions
or requirements of the Note Agreement or any other document to which the
Depositary is not a party in its capacity as such. The Depositary may execute
any of the agencies or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either
directly or by or through agents or attorneys, and the Depositary shall not be
responsible for any negligence or misconduct on the part of any agent or
attorney appointed by it with due care hereunder. In no event shall the
Depositary be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of
any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the
Depositary has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action. The Depositary shall be entitled to rely on a
notice from a person or persons stating that such person is a holder or that
such persons constitute the Required Holders as conclusive evidence that such
person or persons are in fact a holder or the Required Holders. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Depositary shall not be
responsible for the calculation of any amounts hereunder and shall be entitled
to conclusively rely on the accuracy of any and all amounts stated in each
Disbursement Requisition delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Depositary shall not be relieved from liability for its own grossly negligent
action, its own grossly negligent failure to act, or from its own willful
misconduct. </P>

amounts owing to the holders and the other Secured Parties under the Financing
Documents have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash (excluding contingent
obligations and reimbursement obligations that by their terms expressly survive
the repayment in full of the Notes and for which no claim has been asserted). In

without any requirement to make any independent investigation, on a certificate
of the Required Holders certifying that the Obligations under the Financing
Documents have been paid in full in cash (other than contingent indemnification
and reimbursement obligations that by their terms expressly survive the
repayment in full of the Notes). Upon termination of this Agreement, the
Depositary shall transfer remaining amounts, if any, together with any earnings
thereon, on deposit in the Pledged Accounts to the party or parties specified in
a certificate of an officer of the Issuer. The Collateral Agent, the Depositary
and each other Secured Party shall execute and deliver to the Issuer, at the
Issuer&#146;s expense, upon such termination such Uniform Commercial Code termination

authorized to take actions in connection with this Agreement. Promptly after any
change in the officers authorized to take actions in connection with this
Agreement, the Issuer will deliver to the Depositary an updated incumbency

conclusively rely on any such incumbency certificate until receipt of a
superseding incumbency certificate. In the absence of an initial or updated
incumbency certificate, the Depositary shall be entitled to rely on any
communication from the Issuer to be purported signed by any officer thereof.

written statements from each of the holders of the outstanding principal amount
of its Notes. The Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any such action
or give any such approval prior to receiving such written statements. In any
event, upon payment in full in cash of any Note, the holder thereof shall
deliver written notice to the Collateral Agent that such Note has been paid in
full in cash, and the Collateral Agent may rely thereon. </P>

receives written notice of the assignment or transfer of such Note signed by
such Person and in form satisfactory to the Collateral Agent; (b) may at the

and all claims, liabilities (including environmental liabilities), obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, judgments, costs, expenses (including the reasonable

<STRONG>Resignation and Removal; Successor Agent</STRONG>. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent as provided below,
the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving at least 30 days&#146; prior
written notice to the holders and the Issuer, or shall resign at any time at the
request of the Required Holders upon 30 days&#146; prior written notice from the
Required Holders, <U>provided</U> that (i) such resignation will not be
effective until a successor Collateral Agent has been appointed and (ii) the
Issuer shall pay all fees and expenses then due and owing to the resigning
Collateral Agent prior to the effectiveness of its resignation. Upon any
resignation, the Required Holders will have the right to appoint a successor
Collateral Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent has been appointed and has
accepted its appointment within 30 days after notice of the resignation of the
resigning Collateral Agent, the resigning Collateral Agent may at the expense of
the Issuer petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Collateral Agent, which will be a commercial bank organized under the
laws of the United States or of any state thereof and having a combined capital
and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Collateral Agent, the successor Collateral Agent will succeed to and be vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Collateral Agent, and the
resigning Collateral Agent will be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement. After any resigning Collateral Agent&#146;s resignation, the
provisions of this <b>Article II </b>will (x) inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Collateral Agent and
(y) survive with respect to any indemnification claim it may have relating to
this Agreement. Any corporation into which the Collateral Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Agent shall
be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the
corporate trust or agency business of the Collateral Agent, shall be the
successor of the Collateral Agent hereunder; <u>provided</u> that such
corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this <b>Article II </b>to act as a
successor Collateral Agent, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In the event that the
Collateral Agent is required to acquire title to an asset, or take any
managerial action of any kind in regard thereto, in order to perform any
obligation under any Financing Document, which in the Collateral Agent&#146;s sole
determination may cause the Collateral Agent to incur potential liability under
any environmental law, the Collateral Agent reserves the right, instead of
taking such action, to resign as the Collateral Agent in accordance with this <b>Section 2.7</b>.</P>

Agreement and the other Financing Documents. Upon the occurrence and during the

Obligations without notice and without taking possession of the Property.
Trustor hereby appoints Beneficiary as its attorney-in-fact, which power of
attorney is coupled with an interest and irrevocable, to sign the name of
Trustor and to bind Trustor on all papers and documents relating to the
operation, leasing and maintenance of the Property. Trustor shall do nothing to
impair Beneficiary's ability to collect and retain the Rents herein assigned.
All Rents collected by Trustor after revocation of Trustor's license shall be

Environmental Costs), expenses, losses or damages which may or might be asserted
against or incurred by such indemnified persons solely by reason of
Beneficiary's status as an assignee pursuant to the assignment of Leases,
Contracts and Rents contained herein or in the Financing Documents. Should Beneficiary incur any such
liability (other than solely as a result of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct), the amount thereof, including costs, expenses and attorneys' fees,
shall constitute Secured Obligations and Trustor shall reimburse such
indemnified person therefor promptly upon demand, as and to the extent set forth
in the Financing Documents. This Section 3.5 shall survive the termination of

sale, and from time to time thereafter may postpone such sale by public
announcement at such time fixed by the preceding postponement. Trustee shall
deliver to the purchaser at such sale a deed conveying the Property or portion

<U>Removal</U>. Trustor shall not, without the prior written consent of
Beneficiary, remove or permit the removal of any Fixtures from the Property,
except for Fixtures removed and replaced as permitted by the Financing
Documents. Beneficiary further reserves the right to prohibit the removal of any
Fixtures by any Person with the legal right to remove any such Fixtures from the
Property unless and until such Person makes arrangements with (and satisfactory
to) Beneficiary for the payment to Beneficiary of all costs of repairing any
physical injury to the Property which may be caused by the removal of those
Fixtures. Beneficiary shall have the right to require that any such payment
shall be made directly to Beneficiary. If no Event of Default shall be
continuing, Beneficiary shall make any such payments made directly to
Beneficiary available to Trustor to pay the costs of repairing any physical
injury caused by the removal of such Fixtures, subject to such requirements and
conditions as Beneficiary may reasonably impose. If an Event of Default shall be
continuing, Beneficiary may hold such payment as additional Collateral under
this Deed of Trust or may apply such payment to any indebtedness secured by the
Financing Documents pursuant to NRS 104.9608 (as applicable) or otherwise.
Failure by Trustor to cause the delivery to Beneficiary of any such payment
shall constitute both (a) waste under (and a breach of) this Deed of Trust; and
(b) conversion of the Collateral under (and a breach of) the Financing
Documents. </P>

to constitute interest which would increase the effective interest rate to a

risk of loss, damage, diminution in value, or destruction of the Pledged
Collateral will be borne by the Pledgor. The Collateral Agent will have no

the contrary, in no event shall the Collateral Agent be liable for special,

thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of

upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process

extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid personal

Such service may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to the
Pledgor, in care of the process agent at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10011,

by law or affect the right of any party hereto to bring any action or proceeding
in the courts of any other jurisdiction. If for any reason the process agent
ceases to be available to act as process agent, the Pledgor agrees to
immediately appoint a replacement process agent satisfactory to the Collateral

include, and the Lien and security interest granted under this <B>Section
2.1</B> shall not attach to any Required Approval which by its terms or by
operation of law would become void, voidable, terminable or revocable or would
constitute a breach or default thereunder if a security interest therein was
granted hereunder (such Required Approval being expressly excepted and excluded
from the Lien and terms of this Agreement solely to the extent necessary so as
to avoid such voidness, avoidability, terminability, revocability, breach or
default) or any lease, license, contract, property rights or agreement to which
the Issuer is a party or any of its rights or interests thereunder if and for so
long as the grant of such Lien or security interest shall constitute or result
in (i) the abandonment, invalidation or unenforceability of any right, title or
interest of the Issuer therein or (ii) a breach or termination pursuant to the
terms of, or a default under, any such lease, license, contract property rights
or agreement (other than to the extent that any such term would be rendered
ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the UCC (or any
successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other
applicable law or principles of equity), provided, however, that such Lien and
security interest shall attach immediately at such time as the condition causing
such abandonment, invalidation or unenforceability shall be remedied and, to the
extent severable, shall attach immediately to any portion of such lease,
license, contract, property rights or agreement that does not result in any of
the consequences specified in clauses (i) or (ii) above, including, without

commercially reasonable terms, and the Issuer agrees that a private sale or a
sale on extended payment terms, or in exchange for property, stock or other
consideration will not in and of itself be deemed to be commercially

restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers at any sale as to their number,
nature of business, financial or business expertise, net worth or financial
resources and investment intention or on the basis of any other factors that are
commercially reasonable. Any sale of Collateral may be subject to the

the purpose of investment and without any intention to make a distribution
thereof. </P>

The Issuer expressly agrees that the Collateral Agent need not give more than 10
days&#146; notice to the Issuer of the time and place of any public sale of
Collateral or of the time after which a private sale of Collateral may take
place, and that such notice will constitute reasonable notice under all
circumstances. The Collateral Agent will not be obligated to hold any sale
pursuant to any such notice and may, without notice or publication, adjourn any
public or private sale by announcement at the time and place fixed for such
sale, and a subsequent sale may be held at the time and place designated in such
announcement without further notice or publication. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, the Issuer irrevocably waives any right it may have to make a
demand of performance or other demand, advertisement, judicial hearing or notice
to it or any other Person in connection with the collection, sale or other
disposition of, or realization upon, any or all of the Collateral. </P>

it may have based on the allegation or fact that the price obtained for
Collateral sold at a private sale made in accordance with this Agreement was
less than could have been obtained for the same Collateral at a public sale.
Subject to the penultimate sentence hereof, all risk of loss, damage, diminution
in value or destruction of the Collateral will be borne by the Issuer. The

misconduct by the Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Collateral Agent be liable for special, punitive

Issuer or with respect to or arising out of this Agreement or any other
Financing Document may be brought in or removed to the courts of the State of
New York, in and for the County of New York, or of the United States of America
for the Southern District of New York, in each case, in the Borough of
Manhattan. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party accepts, for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The Issuer agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process out of
any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing
of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, (or any substantially similar
form of mail) postage prepaid, return receipt requested to such party at its
address for notices as specified herein. Each of the parties agrees that such
service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of
process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid
personal service upon and personal delivery to it. Notices under this <B>Section

In addition to and notwithstanding the provisions of <B>Section 6.8(a)</B>
above, the Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints C T Corporation System as its
agent to receive on its behalf and its property service of copies of the summons
and complaint and any other process which may be served in any action or
proceeding. Such service may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such
process to the Issuer, in care of the process agent at 111 Eighth Avenue, New
York, NY 10011, and the Issuer hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the
process agent to accept such service on its behalf. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by law or affect the right of any party hereto to bring any
action or proceeding in the courts of any other jurisdiction. If for any reason
the process agent ceases to be available to act as process agent, the Issuer
agrees to immediately appoint a replacement process agent satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent. Each of the parties hereby waives any right to stay or dismiss
any action or proceeding under or in connection with any or all of this
Agreement or any other Financing Document brought before the foregoing courts on
