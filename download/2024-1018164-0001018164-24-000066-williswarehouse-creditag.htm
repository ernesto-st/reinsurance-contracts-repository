Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, any Designated Lender (a &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221;) may grant to its Eligible Conduit Lender,  identified in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and  the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting  Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.01; provided  that (i) no Conduit Lender shall be committed to make any Loan or have any obligation to pay  any amount in excess of amounts available to such Conduit Lender after paying or making  provision for the payment of its commercial paper and related amounts and nothing herein shall  constitute a commitment to make a Loan or pay any other obligation by any Conduit Lender, and  (ii) if a Conduit Lender elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any  part of such Advance or any other obligation, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make  such Advance or pay such other obligation pursuant to the terms hereof on the date such Advance  is to be made or other obligations paid, without notice or demand from such Borrower.  For the  avoidance of doubt, no action or inaction by any Conduit Lender will excuse any of the  obligations of any Designated Lender as provided herein, including, but not limited to, the  obligations to make timely Advances, as provided in Section 2.02 and Section 2.04.  The making  of a Loan by a Conduit Lender hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the related Granting  Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by such Granting Lender.  No  Conduit Lender shall have an Allocation hereunder.  Each Granting Lender listed in Schedule I  under the heading &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221; hereby designates each entity so identified in such  Schedule as its Conduit Lenders, each of which is, as of the date hereof, an Eligible Conduit  Lender with respect to such Granting Lender.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Conduit Lender  shall be obligated to make any Advance hereunder.  </FONT></DIV>

On the date for prepayment specified in  the Borrower&#8217;s notice under this Section 2.08(c), the Borrower shall repay or procure the  repayment of that Lender&#8217;s participation in the Loans.   - 61 -     (d) Mandatory Prepayments.

If,  during any Interest Period, any such prepayment is made in accordance with this Section 2.08(e),  to the extent that further prepayments by Asset Lessees, Loan Asset Borrowers equal or exceed  the Prepayment Threshold (not counting amounts previously prepaid in accordance with this   - 62 -     Section 2.08(e)(v)), the Borrower shall be entitled to make further prepayments of the Loans in  accordance with this Section.  To the extent that, during any Interest Period, Asset Lessees or  Loan Asset Borrowers have made such prepayments, but no prepayments of the Loans are made  in accordance with this Section, such prepayments shall be applied to the relevant Loans on the  Payment Date at the end of such Interest Period in accordance with the terms the Security  Agreement.

Each such notice of prepayment which is required and  served pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date,  the principal amount of each Loan or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory  prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment.  Promptly  following receipt of any such notice relating to a Loan (and in no event later than 5:00 p.m. (New  York City time) on the same day), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the  contents thereof.

Any principal amounts prepaid  pursuant to Section 2.08(e) shall be applied, first, to the Loan for the relevant affected Asset (as  notified by the Servicer or Borrower to the Administrative Agent) and, second, in the case of any  excess such as the excess prepayment required in the case of certain Dispositions, pro rata to the  Loans for each other Asset.

All interest hereunder  on any Loan shall be computed on a daily basis based upon the outstanding principal amount of  such Loan as of the applicable date of determination.

(a) Illegality of Loans.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this  Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender to honor its obligation to make  or maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, the Term SOFR  Reference Rate or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term  SOFR Reference Rate or Term SOFR, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower  thereof (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) (an &#8220;Illegality Notice&#8221;).  If the Borrower so  requires, such Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, for a period of up to 60  days (or such longer period as the parties may agree) after the date on which the Borrower  received such Illegality Notice, negotiate in good faith with a view to concluding arrangements  whereby such Lender&#8217;s obligation to make or continue its Loans shall be able to be maintained.   Each such Lender shall consider, at the Borrower&#8217;s request, transferring its rights and obligations  hereunder to another of its offices or branches or to an affiliate or other actions which would  avoid or not cause such circumstances to arise and shall otherwise take such reasonable steps as  may be open to it to avoid such illegality; provided that such Lender shall be under no obligation  to take any such action if, to do so in such Lender&#8217;s opinion, might involve it (or any of its  Affiliates) in any unlawful activity, or might result in it (or any of its Affiliates) suffering any  loss, cost, liability expense or disadvantage in respect of Taxes which has not been indemnified  by the Borrower or other Borrower Group Company to the reasonable satisfaction of such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in  connection with any such designation or assignment requested by the Borrower.  In any such case, such Lender&#8217;s obligation to make or continue such Loans shall be suspended  until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain Loans (in which case the provisions  of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.11 shall be applicable).  (b) Treatment of Affected Loans.  Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice,  Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality and if the obligation of any Lender to make  Loans or to continue Loans shall be suspended pursuant to this Section 2.11, upon demand from  any Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert such Lender&#8217;s  outstanding Loans into Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin on the  last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Loans or on such earlier date as may be  required by Applicable Law as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the  Administrative Agent and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided in paragraph (c)  of this Section that the circumstances that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist:  (i) to the extent that such Lender&#8217;s Loans have been so converted, all  payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender&#8217;s Loans  shall be applied instead to its Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate; and  (ii) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued by such  Lender as Loans shall be made or continued instead as Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate  plus the Applicable Margin.  (c) End of Illegality.  If any Lender whose obligation to make or maintain  Loans has been suspended pursuant to this Section 2.11 gives notice to the Borrower with a copy   - 65 -     to the Administrative Agent that the circumstances that gave rise to such suspension no longer  exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a  time when Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lender&#8217;s Loans bearing interest  at the Base Rate shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding  Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect  thereto, all such Loans will bear interest at Term SOFR plus the Applicable Margin.  Section 2.12 Increased Costs.    (a) Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including  pursuant to regulations issued from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board for determining  the maximum reserve requirement), special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar  requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any  Lender;   (ii) subject the Security Trustee, the Administrative Agent or any  Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b)  through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans,  loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other  liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or  (iii) impose on any Lender any other condition other than Taxes  affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender,  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or  maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the  amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder with respect to the Loans  (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower  will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for  such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered, in each case; provided that such additional  costs have not been compensated for pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement and  provided further that the Borrower shall not be required to make payments to such Lender under  this Section 2.12 to the extent the claim arises from such Lender&#8217;s willful breach of Applicable  Law.  (b) Capital Requirements.  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law  affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender&#8217;s holding company,  if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return  on such Lender&#8217;s capital or on the capital of such Lender&#8217;s holding company, if any, as a  consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which  such Lender or such Lender&#8217;s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law  (taking into consideration such Lender&#8217;s policies and the policies of such Lender&#8217;s holding  company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such  Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender&#8217;s  holding company for any such reduction suffered.   - 66 -     (c) Certificates from Lenders.  A certificate of a Lender setting forth the  amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case  may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and  shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that such determinations and allocations are  made on a reasonable and good faith basis.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount  shown as due on any such certificate on the later of 10 Business Days after receipt thereof and  the next succeeding Payment Date.  (d) Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand  compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s right to  demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a  Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days  prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such  increased costs or reductions and of such Lender&#8217;s intention to claim compensation therefor.  In allocating any amounts due under this Section 2.12, each Lender agrees that it shall not  allocate any such amounts to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and/or the  assets and/or liabilities constituted or evidenced thereby for which it may seek compensation  pursuant to this Section 2.12 in a manner which discriminates against the Borrower when  compared to other similar obligors, transactions and assets and/or liabilities of the Lender and  shall make such allocation in no less favorable a manner than the manner of allocation utilized in  respect of such other similar obligors, transactions and assets and/or liabilities.  Section 2.13 Break Funding Payments.  In the event of:  (a) the payment of any principal of any Loan other than on the last day of an  Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default);  (b) the failure to borrow, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in  any notice delivered pursuant hereto; or  (c) the assignment of any Loan as a result of a request by the Borrower  pursuant to Section 2.17 or 12.02(c) other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor,  then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense  (other than loss of profit or margin) attributable to such event (such compensation, a &#8220;Break  Funding Payment&#8221;).  A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation  of any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be  delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay  such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate on the relevant prepayment date or  date of assignment of the applicable Loan or in the case of paragraph (b), within three Business  Days of written demand.  Section 2.14 Taxes.    (a) Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any  obligation of the Borrower or a Borrower Group Company hereunder or under any other Loan  Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes;  </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this paragraph, the completion, execution and submission of such  documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.14(e)(i) and (ii) below) shall  not be required if in the Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission  would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially  prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  Each Lender shall promptly notify  the Borrower and the Security Trustee of any change in circumstances that would modify or  render invalid any previously claimed exemption or redemption.  Without limiting the generality  of the foregoing:  (i) Each Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and  the Security Trustee on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this  Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the  Security Trustee), copies of executed IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from  U.S. federal backup withholding tax; and  (ii) Each Lender that is a Non-U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is  legally able to do so, at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time  to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower), execute and deliver to the  Borrower (with a copy to the Security Trustee) whichever of the following is applicable:  (A) in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of an income  tax treaty to which the United States is a party:  (1) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan  Document, copies of executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable,  establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  &#8220;interest&#8221; article of such tax treaty; and   (2) with respect to any other applicable payments under  any Loan Document, copies of executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as  applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax  pursuant to the &#8220;business profits&#8221; or &#8220;other income&#8221; article of such tax treaty;  (B) copies of executed IRS Form W-8ECI;  (C) in the case of a Lender which is a Non-U.S. Person  claiming the benefits of the portfolio interest exemption under Section 881(c) of the Code:  (1) a statement of such Lender signed under penalty of  perjury that such Lender is not a &#8220;bank&#8221; within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code,  a &#8220;10-percent shareholder&#8221; of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the  Code, or a &#8220;controlled foreign corporation&#8221; related to the Borrower described in  Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a &#8220;U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate&#8221;); and    - 69 -     (2) copies of executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS  Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or  (D) to the extent a Lender that is a Non-U.S. Person is not the  beneficial owner, copies of executed IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by copies of executed  IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, IRS Form W-9, a U.S. Tax  Compliance Certificate, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as  applicable; provided that if such Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners  of such Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Lender may provide a U.S.  Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner.  (f) Treatment of Certain Tax Refunds.  If the Security Trustee or a Lender  believes in its sole discretion exercised in good faith that it has actually received a Tax (including  Other Tax) refund (including an offset against tax due in lieu of payment of a refund) resulting  from any amount or additional amount paid by the Borrower or a Borrower Group Company  under this Section 2.14, it shall pay to the Borrower or such Borrower Group Company all or part  of that benefit (but only to the extent of amounts paid under this Section 2.14 with respect to the  Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes)  of the Security Trustee or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the  relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  The Borrower or such Borrower  Group Company, upon the request of the Security Trustee or such Lender, shall repay to the  Security Trustee or such Lender the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any  penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event  that the Security Trustee or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental  Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the  Security Trustee or a Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower or a Borrower Group  Company pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would leave the Security Trustee  or the Lender (after that payment) in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have  been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted,  withheld or otherwise imposed and no amount or additional amount had been required to be paid.   This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Security Trustee or any Lender to make  available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential)  to the Borrower or any other Person.  (g) Claim Notice.  If a claim is made against the Security Trustee or a Lender,  as the case may be, for any Indemnified Taxes (a &#8220;Claim&#8221;), the Security Trustee or such Lender  shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt of a written notification of such Claim, give the  Borrower written notification of such Claim; provided that the failure to give such notice on a  timely basis shall not preclude a Claim for indemnification hereunder.  (h) FATCA.  (i) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Security Trustee  at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the  Borrower or the Security Trustee such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including  as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation  reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Security Trustee as may be necessary for the   - 70 -     Borrower and the Security Trustee to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to  determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender&#8217;s obligations under FATCA or to  determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this  paragraph, &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this  Agreement.  (ii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously  delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or  certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Security Trustee in writing of its legal  inability to do so.  (i) Indemnification by Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the  Security Trustee, within 30 days after demand therefor, for:  (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender;  (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the  provisions of Section 12.04 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register; and   (iii) the full amount of any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender  or any Participant of such Lender (or, in the case of a Lender that is treated as a partnership for  U.S. federal income tax purposes, any direct or indirect beneficial owner of such Lender) that are  payable or paid by the Security Trustee, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with  respect thereto, whether or not such Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted  by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or  liability delivered to any Lender by the Security Trustee shall be prima facie evidence thereof  absent manifest error.  Section 2.15 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.  (a) Payments by the Borrower Group Companies.  Each Borrower Group  Company shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal,  interest, fees, or other amount, or under Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 or 2.18 or otherwise) or under  any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) to the Collections  Account, for application in accordance with section 8 of the Security Agreement prior to 1 p.m.  (New York City time) on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or  counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may be deemed to have been  received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  If any  payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall  be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,  interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension; provided that, in the case of  principal of and interest payable hereunder on a Payment Date, if by virtue of such extension  such payment would fall in the next succeeding month, such sum shall be payable on the next  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white"> - 71 -     preceding Business Day.  All payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document (except to  the extent otherwise provided therein) shall be made in Dollars.   (b) Pro Rata Treatment.  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:  (i) each Loan shall be made from the Lenders pro rata according to  the amounts of their respective Commitments;  (ii) each Loan shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according  to their respective Applicable Percentage;  (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by the Borrower  shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid  principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and  (iv) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made  for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans  then due and payable to the respective Lenders.  (c) Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Secured Party shall, by  exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any  principal of or interest on account of the Loans resulting in such Secured Party receiving payment  of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon then  due than the proportion received by any other Secured Party, then the Secured Party receiving  such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and  Commitments of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments  shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of  and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that:  (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of  the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the  purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and   (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to:  (A) an assignment or participation made pursuant to Section  12.02(c) or 2.17; or   (B) any other payment made pursuant to and in accordance  with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration  for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant,  other than to WLFC or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall  apply unless such assignment or participation is made pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(iii) or 2.17).   Each Borrower Group Company consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may  effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the  foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower Group Company rights of set-off   - 72 -     and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct  creditor of such Borrower Group Company in the amount of such participation.  (d) Presumptions of Payment.  Unless the Security Trustee shall have  received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Security  Trustee for account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the  Security Trustee may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in  accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the  amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the  Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Security Trustee forthwith on demand the amount so  distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such  amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Security Trustee, at the  Federal Funds Rate.  (e) Certain Deductions by the Security Trustee.  If any Lender shall fail to  make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.15(d), then the Security  Trustee may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts  thereafter received by the Security Trustee for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender&#8217;s  obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.  Section 2.16 Mitigation Obligations; Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If:  (a) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12; or  (b) the Borrower is required to pay any indemnification or additional amount  to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14;   then such Lender shall, as soon as reasonably practicable upon its Lending Office becoming  aware of the same, notify the Borrower thereof.  If the Borrower so requires, such Lender and the  Security Trustee shall negotiate in good faith with a view to concluding arrangements whereby  payments can be made hereunder or obligations maintained and performed in such manner, place,  currency and other circumstances as shall not give rise to such increased payment or claim for  such, as the case may be, and so as to achieve substantially the same result as would have been  achieved had such claim or increased payment, as the case may be, not occurred and, in  connection therewith, such Lender shall consider (without prejudice to the right of the Lenders  to structure their affairs as they see fit), at the Borrower&#8217;s request, transferring its rights and  obligations hereunder to another of its offices or branches or to an affiliate or other actions which  would avoid or not cause such circumstances to arise and shall otherwise take such reasonable  steps as may be open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances; provided that such Lender  shall be under no obligation to take any such action if to do so in such Lender&#8217;s opinion might  involve it (or any of its Affiliates) in any unlawful activity, or would or would be likely to result  in it (or any of its Affiliates) suffering any loss, cost, liability, expense or disadvantage in respect  of Taxes in respect of which it has not been indemnified by the Borrower or any Borrower Group  Company to the reasonable satisfaction of such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all  reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation  or assignment requested by the Borrower.     - 73 -     Section 2.17 Replacement of Lenders.  If:  (a) it becomes illegal for any Lender to make its Loans under Section 2.11;  (b) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12; or  (c) the Borrower is required to pay any indemnification or additional amount  to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14,  and such circumstances do not apply to all of the Lenders, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender,  then the Borrower may, at its sole expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative  Agent, cause such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and  subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under  this Agreement, together with all Loans held by any related Conduit Lender, to an assignee that  shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be WLFC or an Affiliate thereof or another  Lender, if such Lender accepts such assignment or any other bank or financial institution  reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of the Required  Lenders); provided that:  (i) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the  outstanding principal amount of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other  amounts payable to it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any Break  Funding Payments if the assignment occurs other than on a Payment Date), from the assignee (to  the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the  case of all other amounts);   (ii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for  compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such  assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments; and  (iii) such Lender shall be under no obligation to accept such if such  might, in such Lender&#8217;s opinion, involve it or any of its Affiliates in any unlawful activity, or  would or would likely result in it or any of its Affiliates suffering any loss, cost, liability, expense  or disadvantage in respect of Taxes in respect of which it has not been indemnified by the  Borrower or any Borrower Group Company to the reasonable satisfaction of such Lender.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a  result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to  require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Section 2.18 Market Disruption.  Subject to Section 2.19, in the event that the  Administrative Agent shall have determined in its reasonable discretion (which determination  shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the Borrower and the Lenders absent manifest  error), on or prior to any interest rate determination date, that adequate and fair means do not  exist for ascertaining the Interest Rate applicable to a Loan on the basis provided for in the  definition of Term SOFR, or, if Lenders holding at least 66.7% of the aggregate principal amount  of the Loans notify the Administrative Agent that the cost to each such notifying Lender of  maintaining the Loans exceeds the applicable Term SOFR ascertained as set forth in the   - 74 -     definition of Term SOFR (or, if applicable, the applicable Benchmark Replacement) the  Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by email, facsimile or telephone confirmed  in writing) to the Borrower and each Lender of such determination, whereupon the Interest Rate  applicable to any Loan for any subsequent Interest Period shall be equal to the Base Rate plus the  Applicable Margin until the Administrative Agent has revoked such notice. Upon receipt of such  notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending Loan Request.  Section 2.19 Benchmark Replacement Setting.    (a) Benchmark Replacement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related  Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior any setting of the then-current Benchmark,  then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition  of &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221; for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark  Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan  Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any  amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other  Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b)  of the definition of &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221; for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such  Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any  Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time)  on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to  the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this  Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received,  by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders  comprising the Required Lenders.  (b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.  In connection with the  use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the  Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments  implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or  consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  (c) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark.  Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the  implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate  (including Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not  displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as  selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor  for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of  information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative,  then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or  analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable  or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either  (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a  Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not  </FONT></DIV>

(d) Upon the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice of the commencement of a  Benchmark Unavailability Period, (i) the Borrower may revoke any request for an Loan and, if  the Borrower does not revoke any such request within three Business Days of receipt of such  notice, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted (A) any such request into a request for a  Loan bearing interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin and (B) any outstanding  affected Loan will be deemed to have been converted into a Loan bearing interest at the Base  Rate plus the Applicable Margin on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such  Loans.

(b) Following an Event of Default, all proceeds from the disposition of  Collateral shall be distributed in accordance with section 8 of the Security Agreement.  (c) In case of an Event of Default that arises from an act or condition solely  affecting one or more Assets or Borrower Group Companies (but not the Borrower), such Event  of Default shall be deemed cured if, within 60 days of the occurrence of such Event of Default,  the Borrower (as funded by an equity contribution or Subordinated Indebtedness) shall prepay  the Required Prepayment Amount for the Loans relating to such Assets or Borrower Group   - 113 -     Companies and no other Default or Event of Default is continuing or would result therefrom;  provided that the Borrower shall transfer its interest in such Borrower Group Companies (which  transfer shall not constitute a Disposition) within 60 days following the payment specified above  being made.  (d) The Borrower may only cure an Event of Default under Section 10.01 that  has occurred because the Available Collections Amount is insufficient to make such payments  on up to six consecutive and up to 12 cumulative Payment Dates; provided that there is no  limitation on the right of the Borrower to cure any shortfalls in the Available Collections Amount  relating to power by the hour arrangements or rent deferral arrangements (other than an  amendment that reduces scheduled basic rent or principal and interest with respect to an Asset),  or on the ability of the Borrower to make principal payments to cure or avoid any mandatory  prepayment event, Early Amortization Event, DSCR Cash Trap Event or other event relating to  LTV, DSCR or Concentration Breach Event.  ARTICLE XI    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND SECURITY TRUSTEE  Section 11.01. Appointment.  Each Secured Party does hereby, and by its execution of  any Hedging Agreement shall be deemed to, as applicable, irrevocably designate and appoint (i)  the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Secured Party under this Agreement and the other  Loan Documents, (ii) the Security Trustee to take such action on behalf of the Secured Parties  and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it under this  Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party, and each Secured Party  irrevocably authorizes each Secured Party Representative and (iii) the Facility Agent as the agent  of such Secured Party under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in such capacity, to  take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are  expressly delegated to it under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Each of the Administrative  Agent, the Security Trustee and the Facility Agent hereby agrees to and accepts such appointment.  Each Secured Party Representative and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits  from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower Group Company as though  the Administrative Agent or the Security Trustee, as the case may be, were not a Secured Party  Representative.  With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, each Secured Party  Representative shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not a Secured Party  Representative, and the terms &#8220;Lender&#8221; and &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall include each Secured Party  Representative in its individual capacity.  Section 11.02. Exculpatory Provisions.  No Secured Party Representative shall have any  duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:   - 114 -     (a) no Secured Party Representative shall be subject to any fiduciary or other  implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;  (b) no Secured Party Representative shall have any duty to take any  discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers  expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such Secured Party  Representative is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders; and   (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, no  Secured Party Representative shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any  discretionary powers or have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,  any information relating to any Borrower Group Company that is communicated to or obtained  by such Secured Party Representative or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.    No Secured Party Representative shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the  consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence  or willful misconduct.  No Secured Party Representative shall be deemed to have knowledge of  any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by a  Borrower Group Company or to the Security Trustee by the Administrative Agent, as the case  may be, and neither Secured Party Representative shall be responsible for or have any duty to  ascertain or inquire into:   (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection  with this Agreement or any other Loan Document;  (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered  hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith (including recalculating or  re-verifying any calculation or information set forth therein);  (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements  or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein;  (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this  Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document; or   (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere  herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such  Secured Party Representative.  Section 11.03. Reliance.  Each Secured Party Representative shall be entitled to rely, and  shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent,  certificate, affidavit, facsimile, letter, email, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other  document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent  or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel  (including counsel to the Borrower Group Companies), independent accountants and other  experts selected by such Secured Party Representative.  The Secured Party Representatives may  deem and treat the payee of any Loan as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such Loan shall  have been transferred in accordance with Section 12.04 and all actions required by such Section  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white"> - 115 -     in connection with such transfer shall have been taken.  Each Secured Party Representative shall  be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan  Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if  so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified  by this Agreement, or in the case of the Security Trustee, the Administrative Agent) as such  Secured Party Representative deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction  by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of  taking or continuing to take any such action.  Each Secured Party Representative shall in all cases  be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this  Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement),  and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all  the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.  Section 11.04. Delegation.  Each Secured Party Representative may execute any of its  duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys in  fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel of its own choosing concerning all matters  pertaining to such duties and shall not incur any liability in acting in good faith in accordance  with any advice from such counsel.  No Secured Party Representative shall be responsible for the  negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in fact selected by it with reasonable care.  Section 11.05. Resignation of Administrative Agent or Security Trustee.  The  Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent and the Security Trustee may resign  as Security Trustee upon 60 days&#8217; notice to the Lenders, the Hedging Provider, the other Secured  Parties and the Borrower.  If any such Secured Party Representative shall resign under this  Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor  representative for the Secured Parties, which successor representative shall be subject to approval  by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon  such successor representative shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such Secured Party  Representative, and the term &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221; or &#8220;Security Trustee,&#8221; as the case may be,  shall mean such successor representative effective upon such appointment and approval, and such  former Secured Party Representative&#8217;s rights, powers and duties as such Secured Party  Representative shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such  former Secured Party Representative or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the  Loans.  If no successor representative has accepted appointment as such Administrative Agent or  Security Trustee, as the case may be, by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Secured Party  Representative&#8217;s notice of resignation, then the retiring Secured Party Representative may apply  to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Secured Party  Representative or for other appropriate relief.  The costs and expenses (including its attorneys&#8217;  fees and expenses) incurred by such Secured Party Representative in connection with such  proceeding shall be paid by the Borrower.  Upon receipt of the identity of the successor Security  Trustee, the Security Trustee shall deliver the Collateral then held under the Loan Documents to  the successor Security Trustee.  Upon its resignation and delivery of the Collateral as set forth in  this Section and appointment of the replacement Security Trustee, the Security Trustee shall be  discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in connection with the Collateral  or this Agreement.  After any retiring Secured Party Representative&#8217;s resignation as Secured  Party Representative, the provisions of this Article XI shall inure to its benefit as to any actions   - 116 -     taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Secured Party Representative under this Agreement  and the other Loan Documents.  In the event that Bank of America, N.A. is no longer a Lender,  each of the rights and obligations of the Facility Agent shall devolve automatically and without  further act by any Person become rights and obligations of the Administrative Agent, who hereby  accepts such rights and obligations.  Section 11.06. Removal of Administrative Agent or Security Trustee.  Subject to the  appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent or Security Trustee as provided  below the Required Lenders may remove the Administrative Agent or the Security Trustee at any  time, in each case by giving notice thereof to the Lenders, the Borrower and the other of the  Administrative Agent or the Security Trustee.  Upon any such removal, the Required Lenders  shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Security Trustee, which  successor Administrative Agent or Security Trustee shall be subject to approval by the Borrower  (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  Upon the acceptance of any  appointment as Administrative Agent or Security Trustee hereunder by a successor  Administrative Agent or Security Trustee, such successor Administrative Agent or Security  Trustee shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and  duties of the removed Administrative Agent or Security Trustee, and the removed Administrative  Agent or Security Trustee shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  After  any Administrative Agent&#8217;s or Security Trustee&#8217;s removal hereunder as Administrative Agent or  Security Trustee, the provisions of this Article XI shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect  of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent  or Security Trustee.  Section 11.07. No Representations or Warranties.  Each Lender hereby and each  Hedging Provider by entering into a Hedging Agreement, as applicable, expressly acknowledges  that neither of the Secured Party Representatives nor any of their respective officers, directors,  employees, agents, attorneys in fact or Affiliates have made any representations or warranties to  it and that no act by any Secured Party Representative hereafter taken, including any review of  the affairs of a Borrower Group Company or any affiliate of a Borrower Group Company, shall  be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Secured Party Representative to  any Lender and any Hedging Provider.  Each Lender hereby and each Hedging Provider by  entering into a Hedging Agreement represents to the Secured Party Representatives that it has,  independently and without reliance upon any Secured Party Representative or any other Secured  Party and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate made its own  appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other  condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower Group Companies and their Affiliates and made  its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also  hereby and each Hedging Provider by entering into a Hedging Agreement represents that it will,  independently and without reliance upon any Secured Party Representative or any other Secured  Party, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action  under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems  necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition  and creditworthiness of the Borrower Group Companies and their Affiliates.  Except for notices,  reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders or the Hedging  Providers by any Secured Party Representative hereunder or any other Loan Document, no   - 117 -     Secured Party Representative shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any  Hedging Provider with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations,  property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Borrower Group  Company or any Affiliate of a Borrower Group Company that may come into the possession of  such Secured Party Representative or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys  in fact or Affiliates.  The Administrative Agent and the Security Trustee shall each provide each  Lender, the other Secured Party Representative and each Hedging Provider with a copy of all  notices, reports and other written communication from any Borrower Group Company.  The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept responsibility for, and shall not have  any liability with respect to the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of  or any other matter related to the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Term SOFR, or any component  definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof, or any alternative, successor or  replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the  composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including  any Benchmark Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic  equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term  SOFR or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.  The Administrative  Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the  calculation of the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, any alternative, successor or  replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto,  in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may select  information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain the Term SOFR Reference  Rate, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,  and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages  of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages,  costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity),  for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such  information source or service.  Section 11.08. Security Trustee and Administrative Agent.  The Security Trustee shall  be entitled to payment from the Borrower for fees and expenses for all services rendered by it  hereunder as separately agreed to in writing between the Borrower and the Security Trustee (as  such fees may be adjusted as agreed from time to time).  The obligations contained in this Section  shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Security  Trustee.  (a) The Security Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk any of its own  funds or otherwise incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its  duties hereunder.  (b) Any corporation into which the Security Trustee may be merged or  converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,  conversion or consolidation to which the Security Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation  succeeding to the business of the Security Trustee shall be the successor of the Security Trustee  hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper with any party hereto or any further act on  the part of any of the parties hereto except where an instrument of transfer or assignment is   - 118 -     required by Applicable Law to effect such succession, anything herein to the contrary  notwithstanding.  (c) Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement or the  other Loan Documents the Security Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be  proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action to be taken hereunder, such matter  (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence  of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Security Trustee, be deemed to be  conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by one of Borrower&#8217;s or the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s officers, and delivered to the Security Trustee and such certificate, in the  absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Security Trustee, shall be  full warrant to the Security Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the  provisions of this Agreement upon the faith thereof.  (d) Whenever, in the course of performing its duties pursuant to this  Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, the Security Trustee is required to give its consent or  direction or otherwise make a determination under any Loan Documents, it is understood and  agreed that in all such instances it shall only provide such consent, direction or determination  upon receipt of a written direction received from the Administrative Agent (subject to  Section 12.02), and may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon such  direction.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Loan Documents to the contrary, the  Security Trustee shall be fully protected in refraining from giving such consent or direction in  the absence of the direction of the Administrative Agent.  (e) The parties hereto acknowledge that for purposes of applicable local law,  the Security Trustee is required to execute certain Security Documents in its individual capacity,  but always for the benefit of the Secured Parties.  This notwithstanding, the parties hereto agree  that with regard to such Security Documents, the Security Trustee shall be subject to the duties  and responsibilities of the Security Trustee and shall be entitled to the rights, protections,  exculpations, benefits and indemnities set forth in this Agreement.  (f) When the Security Trustee acts on any information, instructions or  communications (including, but not limited to, communications with respect to the delivery of  securities or the wire transfer of funds) sent in accordance with Section 12.01, the Security  Trustee, absent gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach in bad faith, shall not be  responsible or liable in the event such communication is not an authorized or authentic  communication of the Borrower or Administrative Agent or is not in the form the Borrower and  Administrative Agent sent or intended to send (whether due to fraud, distortion or otherwise).   The Borrower shall indemnify the Security Trustee against any loss, liability, claim or expense  (including legal fees and expenses) it may incur with its acting in accordance with any such  communication.  (g) In no event shall the Security Trustee or the Administrative Agent be liable:  (i) for acting in accordance with or conclusively relying upon any  instruction, notice, demand, certificate or document from the Borrower or the Administrative  Agent or any entity acting on behalf of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent;  </FONT></DIV>

(h) Neither the Security Trustee nor the Administrative Agent shall incur any  liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility hereunder  by reason of any occurrence beyond the control of the Security Trustee or the Administrative  Agent (as applicable) (including but not limited to any act or provision of any present or future  law or regulation or governmental authority, any act of God or war, civil unrest, local or national  disturbance or disaster, any act of terrorism, or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank  wire or facsimile or other wire or communication facility).

The  Security Trustee shall not be called upon to advise any party as to the wisdom in selling or  retaining or taking or refraining from any action with respect to any securities or other property  deposited under any Loan Document.  (j) The Security Trustee shall not be under any duty to give the Collateral held  by it under the Loan Documents any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar property  and shall not be required to invest any funds held by it except as directed in accordance with any  Account Control Agreement and the Security Agreement.  Uninvested funds held by the Security  Trustee shall not earn or accrue interest, and the Security Trustee shall incur no liability for any  investment losses.  (k) In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder or in any notice,  instruction or other communication received by the Security Trustee under any Loan Document,  the Security Trustee may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action other than to retain  possession of the Collateral, unless the Security Trustee receives written instructions, signed by  the Administrative Agent, which eliminate such ambiguity or uncertainty.  (l) In the event of any dispute between or conflicting claims among the  Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any other Person or entity with respect to any Collateral,  the Security Trustee shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to refuse to comply with any and all   - 120 -     claims, demands or instructions with respect to such Collateral so long as such dispute or conflict  shall continue, and the Security Trustee shall not be or become liable in any way for failure or  refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions.

The Security Trustee shall be entitled to act on such  court order and legal opinions without further question.  The Security Trustee may, in addition,  elect, in its sole discretion, to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or  orders as it may deem, in its sole discretion, necessary.

Section 12.02. Waivers; Amendments.    (a) No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay by the  Administrative Agent, Security Trustee, the Facility Agent or any Lender in exercising any right  or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of   - 122 -     any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right  or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.   The rights and remedies of the Secured Party Representatives and the Lenders hereunder are  cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No  waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Secured Party  therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of  this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and  for the purpose for which given.

(b) Amendments.  Neither this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor any  terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified except in accordance  with the provisions of this Section 12.02 or Section 2.19.  The Required Lenders and each  Borrower Group Company party to the relevant Loan Document may, or (with the written consent  of the Required Lenders) the Secured Party Representatives and each Borrower Group Company  party to the relevant Loan Document may (provided that with respect to this Agreement, no  amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification hereto shall require the consent of any  Borrower Group Company other than the Borrower):  (i) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications  hereto and thereto (including amendments and restatements hereof or thereof) for the purpose of  adding any provisions to this Agreement or any Loan Document or changing in any manner the  rights of the Lenders or of the Secured Parties hereunder or thereunder; or  (ii) waive, on such terms and conditions as may be specified in the  instrument of waiver, any of the requirements of this Agreement or any Loan Document or any  Default or Event of Default and its consequences,  provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification  shall:  (A) increase the Commitment or outstanding Loans of any  Lender without the written consent of such Lender;  (B) reduce or forgive the principal amount or extend the final  scheduled date of maturity of any Loan, alter the amount of Loans that may be borrowed with  respect to each Owned Asset or in the aggregate, extend the scheduled date of any amortization  payment in respect of any Loan, change the stated rate of any interest or fee payable under this  Agreement or any other Loan Document other than interest payable at the Default Rate, in each  case, without the written consent of each Designated Lender (or in the case of a fee, each Lender  to whom (or to whose Conduit Lender) such fee is payable);  (C) change Section 2.15(b) or (c) or section 8 of the Security  Agreement, in a manner that would alter the pro rata allocation of obligations or pro rata sharing  of payments required thereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender;  </FONT></DIV>

If, in connection with any  proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination to any of the provisions of this Agreement as  contemplated by paragraph (b) of this Section, the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained  but the consent of one or more of the other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained,  then (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the Borrower shall have the  right, at their sole cost and expense, to replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with  one or more replacement Lenders by requiring such Lender to assign and delegate, without  recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04), all its  interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such  obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);  provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Required  Lenders (excluding the non-consenting Lenders), (ii) such non-consenting Lender shall have  received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its Loans, accrued  interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder or under any other  Loan Document, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued  interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts including, without limitation,  Break Funding Payments), (iii) the Borrower has identified a replacement Lender; and (iv) each  such replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination.  (d) Defaulting Lenders.    (i) Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to  the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until  such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable  law:  (A) Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s  right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement  shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.   - 124 -     (B) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal,  interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such  Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article X or  otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to  Section 12.09 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative  Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the  Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or  Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender  has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the  Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to  be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s  potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the  payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting  Lender&#8217;s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of  Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment  of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as  a result of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to  such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided  that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which  such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made  at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.01 and Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived,  such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro  rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until  such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments  under this Agreement. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a  Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall  be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably  consents hereto.  (C) Certain Fees.  No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to  receive any Unused Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting  Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have  been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).   (ii) Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent  will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and  subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at  par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the  Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by  the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under this Agreement, whereupon such Lender  will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively  with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender  was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further that except to the extent otherwise expressly  agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will   - 125 -     constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender&#8217;s  having been a Defaulting Lender.  (e) Schedules.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower may, in connection  with any Loan, without the consent of any Lender or the Administrative Agent, deliver an updated  Schedule II.  Section 12.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.    (a) Costs and Expenses.  The Borrower agree to pay:  (i) all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Secured Party  Representatives, the Lenders, and their respective Affiliates, including the reasonable fees,  charges and disbursements of counsel for each Secured Party Representative and the Lenders in  connection with the documentation of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and  administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments,  modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof, subject to any caps separately agreed;  (ii) all out of pocket expenses incurred by either Secured Party  Representative or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for  the Administrative Agent and the Security Trustee or any Lender, in connection with the  enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made  hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect  thereof; and  (iii) all costs, expenses, assessments and all other charges incurred in  connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of any security interest  contemplated by (and only to the extent required by) any Security Document.    This Section 12.03(a) shall not apply to Taxes, which for the avoidance of doubt are dealt with  solely under Section 2.14.  (b) Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify  the Administrative Agent, the Security Trustee, each Hedging Provider and each Lender, and  each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an  &#8220;Indemnitee&#8221;) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,  damages, liabilities and related reasonable expenses (excluding Taxes, which for the avoidance  of doubt are dealt with solely under Section 2.14), including the fees, charges and disbursements  of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of,  in connection with, or as a result of:  (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, the other Loan  Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by  the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of  the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby;   - 126 -     (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom or any payments that  the Administrative Agent or Security Trustee is required to make in connection with the  performance of its duties hereunder;  (iii) the possession, use, ownership, operation, condition, manufacture,  design, registration and maintenance of any Owned Asset; or   (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or  proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory  and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;   provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such  losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses have resulted from the gross negligence or  willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.  (c) Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that the Borrower fail to pay  any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Security Trustee under  paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent or the Security Trustee, as the case may be, such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage  (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is  sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,  claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against  the Administrative Agent or Security Trustee, as the case may be, in its capacity as such.

To the extent permitted by  Applicable Law, no Borrower Group Company shall assert, and each Borrower Group Company  hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,  consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in  connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated  hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.  (e) Payments.  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly  after written demand therefor.  Section 12.04. Successors and Assigns.    (a) Assignments Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be  binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and  assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of  its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any  attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person  (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the  extent expressly contemplated hereby, each Indemnitee) any legal or equitable right, remedy or  claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  </FONT></DIV>

(i) Each Lender may, at any time, assign all or any portion of its Loans  and/or its Commitments to any Eligible Assignee (other than any natural person); provided that  (A) if such assignment occurs during the Availability Period, and no Event of Default has  occurred and is continuing, and the assignee is not a Person that is already a Lender or an Affiliate  of a Lender, such assigning Lender shall have obtained the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent (not  to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) and (B) such sale, assignment or transfer  shall not have an adverse tax consequence, increased cost or other increase in obligations,  measured as of the date of such sale, assignment or transfer on any member of the Borrower  Group Company.  (ii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph  (b)(iii) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and  Acceptance, the assignee or transferee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the  interest assigned or transferred by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and  obligations of a Lender under this Agreement.  No Borrower Group Company shall be obliged to  make any payment to such assignee or transferee in an amount greater than it would have had to  make or perform any increased obligation that it would not have suffered or incurred had such  assignment or transfer not taken place based on Applicable Laws, rules or regulations existing at  the time of such assignment or transfer.  An assigning or transferring Lender thereunder shall, to  the extent of the interest assigned or transferred by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released  from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance  covering all of the assigning or transferring Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of  Section 2.12, Section 2.14 and Section 12.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring  prior to the effective date of such assignment or transfer.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender  of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be  treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights  and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 12.04.  (iii)  The Security Trustee shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of  each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names  and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts of (and stated  interest on) the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the  &#8220;Register&#8221;).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the  Borrower, Secured Party Representative and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is  recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of  this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for  inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon  reasonable prior notice.  The assignment or transfer of a Loan shall only be effective following  registration of such assignment or transfer on the Register.  The Register is intended to cause  each Loan and other obligation hereunder to be in &#8220;registered form&#8221; within the meaning of  Section 5f.103-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-5(b) of the proposed Treasury  Regulations and within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.   - 128 -     (iv) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance  executed by an assigning or transferring Lender and an assignee or transferee, the processing and  recordation fee in the amount of $2,500 (provided, however, that the Security Trustee may, in its  sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment  or transfer) and any written consent to such assignment or transfer required by paragraph (b)(ii)(A)  of this Section, the Security Trustee shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the  information contained therein in the Register.  No assignment or transfer shall be effective for  purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this  paragraph.  (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.03,  any Conduit Lender may, with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrowers  or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a  portion of its interests in any Advances to its Granting Lender.  (c) (i) Following the Closing Date, any Lender may, with notice to the  Borrower, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a &#8220;Participant&#8221;) in all or a  portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents (including all or a portion of the Loans owing to it); provided that:  (A) such Participant must be an Eligible Assignee (excluding,  for the purposes of this clause (A), clauses (d)(A) through (d)(C) of the definition of Eligible  Assignee);  (B) such Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement and the  other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged;   (C) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other  parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and   (D) the Borrower, the Security Trustee, the Administrative  Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in  connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation  shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other  Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this  Agreement or any other Loan Document;   provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the  consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first  proviso to Section 12.02(b) that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this  Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12,  2.13 and 2.14 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment  pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also  shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such  Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.15(c) as though it were a Lender.   - 129 -     (ii) Limitations on Rights of Participants.  A Participant shall not be  entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12 or 2.14 than the applicable Lender  would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant:  (A) except to the extent (if any) such Participant would have  been so entitled pursuant to this Agreement if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by  assignment pursuant to Section 12.04(b); or   (B) unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is  made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent.    A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 unless the Borrower is notified  of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the  Borrower, to comply with Section 2.14 as though it were a Lender.  (iii) Participant Register.  In the event that any Lender grants a  participation in a Loan, such Lender shall maintain a register, acting solely for this purpose as an  agent of the Borrower, on which it enters the name and address of all participants in the Loans  held by it and the principal amounts of (and stated interest on) the portions of the Loans which  are the subjects of the participations (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;).  A Loan may be participated  in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register; provided  that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register  to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a  Participant&#8217;s interest in rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents (including the portion of the Loans owning to it)) other than to the Borrower (to the  extent notification of the participation is made to such Person(s) pursuant to the above provisions)  except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such participation interest  is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163- 5(b) of the proposed Treasury Regulations.  (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its  rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation,  any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 12.04  shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such  pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations  hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  Section 12.05. Limited Recourse.  Each Borrower Group Company&#8217;s liability under the  Loan Documents and each Secured Party&#8217;s recourse to each Borrower Group Company under the  Loan Documents shall be limited to amounts recovered by the Security Trustee in enforcing the  security constituted by the Security Documents and each Secured Party agrees that it shall not  have recourse under the Loan Documents to any of the Borrower Group Company&#8217;s other assets.   The obligations of each Borrower Group Company under the Loan Documents are solely the  corporate obligations of such Borrower Group Company and no person or entity (including,  without limitation, each Secured Party) shall have any recourse against any director or officer of  any Borrower Group Company in respect of any obligation, covenant, indemnity, representation   - 130 -     or agreement made or given by such Borrower Group Company pursuant to the Loan Documents  or any notice or document which such Borrower Group Company is requested to deliver pursuant  to the provisions of the Loan Documents.  Without prejudice to the rights of the Secured Parties  under the Security Documents, no Secured Party will until the expiry of one year and one day  after the payment of all sums outstanding and owing under the latest maturing Loan, take any  corporate action or other steps or legal proceedings for the winding-up, dissolution or re- organization or for the appointment of a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver,  bankruptcy trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar officer of any Borrower Group Company,  or against any of the revenues and assets of any Borrower Group Company; provided, however,  that nothing shall prevent any party hereto from otherwise participating in such bankruptcy or  other proceeding instituted by any other Person.  Section 12.06. Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties  made by the Borrower Group Companies herein and in the certificates or other instruments  delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied  upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement  and the making of any Loans.  The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.14, 2.19, 12.02 and 12.06 shall  survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the  Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  Section 12.07. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be  executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which  shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.   This Agreement, the other Loans Documents and any separate letter agreements covering fees  payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties  relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and  understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in  Section 3.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the  Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof  which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors  and assigns permitted hereby.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this  Agreement by email shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this  Agreement.  Section 12.08. Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal  or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of  such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and  enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in  a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Section 12.09. Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time  to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general  or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time  owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower Group  </FONT></DIV>

Section 12.13. Judgment Currency.  This is an international loan transaction in which  the specification of Dollars and payment in New York City is of the essence, and the obligations  of the Borrower under this Agreement to make payment to (or for account of) a Lender or Secured  Party Representative in Dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery  pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any other currency or in another place  except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by such Lender or  Secured Party Representative in New York City of the full amount of Dollars payable to such  Lender or Secured Party Representative under this Agreement.  If for the purpose of obtaining  judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another  currency (in this Section called the &#8220;judgment currency&#8221;), the rate of exchange that shall be  applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative   - 133 -     Agent could purchase such Dollars at the principal office of the Administrative Agent in New  York City with the judgment currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such  judgment is rendered.  The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from them  to the Administrative Agent, the Security Trustee, or any Lender hereunder or under any other  Loan Document (in this Section called an &#8220;Entitled Person&#8221;) shall, notwithstanding the rate of  exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on  the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due  hereunder in the judgment currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking  procedures purchase and transfer Dollars to New York City with the amount of the judgment  currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and  notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay  such Entitled Person on demand, in Dollars, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due  to such Entitled Person in Dollars hereunder exceeds the amount of the Dollars so purchased and  transferred.  Section 12.14. Use of English Language.  This Agreement has been negotiated and  executed in the English language.  All certificates, reports, notices and other documents and  communications given or delivered pursuant to this Agreement (including any modifications or  supplements hereto) shall be in the English language or accompanied by a certified English  translation thereof.  In the case of any document originally issued in a language other than English,  the English language version of any such document shall for purposes of this Agreement, and  absent manifest error, control the meaning of the matters set forth therein.

Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the rights and  remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of  any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

No recourse under any  obligation, covenant or agreement of a Conduit Lender as contained in any Loan Document  shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, administrator, member, affiliate, officer,  employee, manager or director of a Conduit Lender (other than the related Designated Lender),  by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any  statute or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the agreements of each  Conduit Lender contained in any Loan Document are solely corporate or limited liability  company obligations of such Conduit Lender and that no personal liability whatsoever shall  attach to or be incurred by the incorporators, stockholders, administrators, members, affiliates,  officers, employees, managers or directors of such Conduit Lender, under or by reason of any  of the respective obligations, covenants or agreements of such Conduit Lender (other than the  related Designated Lender) contained in any Loan Document, or implied therefrom, and that  any and all personal liability of every such incorporator, stockholder, administrator, member,  affiliate, officer, employee, manager or director of such Conduit Lender (other than the related  Designated Lender) with respect to any such obligation, covenant or agreement (including  arising out of any breach thereof by such Conduit Lender), which liability may arise either at  common law or in equity, by statute or constitution, or otherwise, is hereby expressly waived  as a condition of and in consideration for the execution of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Agreement herein, but without limiting the liability and obligation  of the related Designated Lender for all such amounts and other obligations that would  otherwise be payable by such Conduit Lender, no Conduit Lender shall have any obligation to  pay any amount required to be paid by it hereunder, unless it has received such amounts from  payments on the Loans.  In addition, but without limiting the liability and obligation of the  related Designated Lender for all such amounts and other obligations that would otherwise be  payable by such Conduit Lender, all payment obligations of a Conduit Lender hereunder are  contingent upon the availability of funds received by it from payments on the Loans in excess  of the amounts necessary to pay commercial paper, and each party hereto agrees that it shall  not have a claim under Section 101(5) of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar  law in any other jurisdiction against such Conduit Lender unless the amounts received by it of  payments on the Loans are sufficient to pay such amounts and any such payment obligation  exceeds the amount available to a Conduit Lender to pay such amounts after paying or making  provision for the payment of its commercial paper and related amounts.  The provisions of this  Section 12.21 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

In the case of an Owned Asset, after giving effect to the making of the Loan for such Asset,  the Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term must be at least two years (measured by  reference to the Owned Assets subject to Operating Leases).  For the avoidance of doubt,  it is not required that any Asset be subject to a Lease at the Drawdown Date.  2. The Aircraft Equipment (and any Airframe to which an Engine is attached if such Owned  Asset is an Engine) is not subject to any mandatory grounding orders from the FAA  resulting in grounding of airframes or aircraft engines of the same model as such Aircraft  Equipment (excluding any such airframe or aircraft engine that has satisfied certain  conditions, which have been satisfied with respect to the relevant Aircraft Equipment).   3. If the Asset is an Owned Asset subject to an Operating Lease, the Operating Lease satisfies  the Minimum Provisions.     Schedule IX  -1-      SCHEDULE IX    MINIMUM PROVISIONS  Part A: Owned Assets  1.

Subleasing  The Asset Lessee under the Asset Lease shall only be entitled to sublease the Owned Asset on wet  lease or sublease terms which are expressly subject and subordinate in all respects to the Asset  Lease or with the consent of the applicable Lessor and in accordance with, and subject to such  exceptions as are consistent with, the Standard of Care.   4. Return of Owned Asset  The Asset Operating Lease shall contain provisions (consistent with the Standard of Care) for  redelivery of the Owned Asset, including, if applicable, replacement Aircraft Engines and Parts,  on expiry or termination of the leasing of the Owned Asset pursuant to the Asset Operating Lease,  specifying the required return condition and any obligation of the Asset Lessee to remedy or  compensate the lessor thereunder, directly or indirectly, for any material deviations from such  return condition, in each case, considering the other terms of the Asset Operating Lease and in  accordance with, and subject to such exceptions as are consistent with, the Standard of Care.  5. Termination Events  The Asset Lease shall contain provisions (consistent with the Standard of Care) setting forth the  conditions under which the lessor thereunder may terminate the Asset Lease and repossess the   Schedule IX  -2-      Owned Asset, at any time after the expiration of any agreed grace period or remedy period, in each  case, in accordance with the Standard of Care.  6. Net Lease; Hell-or-High Water Obligation  The Asset Lease will be a full recourse payment obligation of the lessee and under which the lessee  is required to pay all maintenance, insurance and taxes on the property subject to such lease in  addition to rent and other normal fees and contain a customary &#8220;hell or high water&#8221; clause under  which the Asset Lessee&#8217;s obligation to make payments shall be absolute and unconditional under  any and all circumstances without any right of set-off or counterclaim and regardless of other  events or similar provisions, but in each case subject to such exceptions as are consistent with the  Standard of Care.  7. Ownership  The Asset Lease shall contain provisions protecting the relevant owner&#8217;s ownership interest,  consistent with the Standard of Care.  8. Maintenance and Operations  The Asset Lease shall contain provisions requiring that the Asset Lessee will maintain the Owned  Asset in good airworthy condition in accordance with the standards of a first-class cargo or  passenger carrier, subject to the Standard of Care.  9. Registration  In the case of an Asset Lease in respect of an Airframe (or an Aircraft Engine solely to the extent  applicable thereto), the Asset Lease shall require that, throughout the term of the Asset Lease, the  Asset Lessee shall, at its sole cost and expense, register and maintain or procure the maintenance  of the registration of the Owned Asset in accordance with the laws of the applicable State of  Registration; and from time to time, take all of the steps then required by Applicable Law, subject  to such exceptions as are consistent with the Standard of Care.    10. Insurance  Such Asset Lease shall, in respect of the relevant Owned Asset, require the relevant Asset Lessee  to maintain insurances, which insurances satisfy the requirements of Section 6.03 of this  Agreement unless the Borrower shall have made alternative arrangements for insurance coverage  satisfying such requirements.    11. Cape Town Convention.  If the Owned Asset is an &#8220;aircraft object&#8221; (as defined in the Cape Town Convention) and  (a) &#8220;at the time of the conclusion&#8221; (as such phrase is used in the Cape Town  Convention) of the relevant Asset Lease, the Asset Lessee is &#8220;situated&#8221; (as such  term is used in the Cape Town Convention) in a Contracting State; or    Schedule IX  -3-      (b) the applicable Owned Asset is registered in a Contracting State,   an International Interest naming the Asset Lessee as debtor and the relevant lessor as creditor shall  be registered on the International Registry against the relevant Airframe and/or (in the case of (a)  only) the Engine(s) comprising the Owned Asset and the Asset Lease shall permit assignments of  such International Interest(s) shall be registered in favor of the Security Trustee, in each case  subject to exceptions consistent with the Standard of Care.   12. Financial Statements  To the extent consistent with the Standard of Care, the Asset Lease shall require that the related  Asset Lessee deliver annual audited and periodic unaudited financial statements of such Asset  Lessee or, if applicable, the related Underlying Obligor.  13. Revolving Credit Finance Lease  If the Asset Lease is a Revolving Credit Finance Lease, the revolving amount available to the  relevant Asset Lessee will not exceed the amount of supplemental rent or usage rent, however  described, paid and not reimbursed to such Asset Lessee.  </FONT></DIV>
