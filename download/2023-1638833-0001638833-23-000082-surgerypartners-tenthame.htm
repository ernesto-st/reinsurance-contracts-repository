Section 1.09.  Pro Forma Calculations. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, financial ratios and tests, including the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and the First Lien Leverage Ratio, and compliance with covenants determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA and Total Assets shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this Section 1.09; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.09, when calculating (i) the First Lien Leverage Ratio for purposes of the Applicable ECF Percentage of Excess Cash Flow, (ii) the First Lien Leverage Ratio for purposes of determining the &#8220;Applicable Margin&#8221; and (iii) the Total Leverage Ratio for the purposes of actual compliance with Section 7.11 (as opposed to a pro forma calculation in accordance with Section 7.11 for purposes of another provision), the events described in this Section 1.09 that occurred subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period shall not be given pro forma effect. (b) For purposes of calculating the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio, Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, Specified Transactions (and the incurrence or repayment of any Indebtedness in connection therewith) that have been made (i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming that all such Specified Transactions (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period.  If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.09, then the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio, Consolidated EBITDA and Total Assets, as applicable, shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in accordance with this Section 1.09. (c) Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of &#8220;run-rate&#8221; cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies related to such Specified Transaction (and related insourcing initiatives) projected by the Borrower in good faith to be realized as a result of specified actions taken or expected to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (calculated (i) on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies had been realized on the first day of the applicable EBITDA Determination Period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies were realized during the entirety of such EBITDA Determination Period and (ii) such that &#8220;run-rate&#8221; means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action either taken or expected to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (in each case, in the good faith determination of the Borrower)) relating to such Specified Transaction, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such EBITDA Determination Period from such actions; provided that (A) such amounts are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable in the good faith determination of the Borrower, (B) such actions are taken or substantial steps with respect to such actions 74 are or are expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of such Specified Transaction and (C) no amounts shall be added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to this Section 1.09(c) to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA, whether through a pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such EBITDA Determination Period. (d) In the event that the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantees) or repays (including by redemption, repayment, retirement, defeasance, discharge or extinguishment) any Indebtedness included in the calculations of the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio and the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as the case may be (in each case, other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business for working capital purposes), (i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio or test is made, then such ratio or test shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repurchase, redemption, repayment, retirement, discharge, defeasance or extinguishment of Indebtedness, in each case, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period (except in the case of the Consolidated Coverage Ratio (or similar ratio), in which case such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repurchase, redemption, repayment, retirement, discharge, defeasance or extinguishment of Indebtedness will be given effect as if the same had occurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period).  If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any interest hedging arrangements applicable to such Indebtedness).  Interest on a Capitalized Lease shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease in accordance with GAAP.  Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a London interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower or Restricted Subsidiary may designate. (e) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of any provision of this Agreement which requires that no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, have occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Borrower, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into.  Furthermore, in connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of: (i) determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement (other than the financial covenant set forth under Section 7.11 (except if being tested on a Pro Forma Basis)) which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including, without limitation, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio or the Total Leverage Ratio, but excluding the calculation of the First Lien Leverage Ratio for purposes of the Applicable ECF Percentage of Excess Cash Flow; or  (ii) testing availability under baskets set forth in this Agreement (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets); in each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower&#8217;s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an &#8220;LCT Election&#8221;), the date of determination of whether any 75 </FONT></DIV>

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the Borrower has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would have failed to have been satisfied as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets of the Borrower or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have failed to have been satisfied as a result of such fluctuations and (ii) such ratios, tests or baskets shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, unless the Borrower elects in its sole discretion to test such ratio, test or basket on the date such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated instead of the date of the related definitive agreement.  If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any event or transaction occurring after the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction (a &#8220;Subsequent Transaction&#8221;) in connection with which a ratio, test or basket availability calculation must be made on a Pro Forma Basis or giving Pro Forma Effect to such Subsequent Transaction, for purposes of determining whether such ratio, test or basket availability has been complied with under this Agreement, any such ratio, test or basket shall be required to be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio or the Total Leverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the &#8220;Fixed Amounts&#8221;) substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that requires compliance with any such financial ratio or test (any such amounts, the &#8220;Incurrence-Based Amounts&#8221;), it is understood and agreed that any Fixed Amount (and any cash proceeds thereof) shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the relevant Incurrence-Based Amount in connection with such substantially concurrent incurrence. Section 1.10.  Certain Accounting Matters.  Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, (a) without giving effect to any election under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 159 or Accounting Standards Codification 825-10-25 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries at &#8220;fair value&#8221;, as defined therein; (b) without giving effect to any treatment of Indebtedness in respect of convertible debt instruments under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a reduced or bifurcated manner as described therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount thereof; and (c) treating Unrestricted Subsidiaries as if they were not consolidated with any other member of the Restricted Group and otherwise eliminating all accounts of Unrestricted Subsidiaries.  For the avoidance of doubt, the principal amount 76 of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a consolidated balance sheet of the Restricted Group dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP, except as expressly set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of the immediately preceding sentence. Section 1.11.  Classification of Loans and Borrowings.  For purposes of this Agreement, Loans may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g., an &#8220;Initial Term Loan&#8221;) or by Type (e.g., a &#8220;Term Benchmark Rate Loan&#8221;) or by Class and Type (e.g., a &#8220;Term Benchmark Rate Term Loan&#8221;). Borrowings also may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g., a &#8220;Term Borrowing&#8221;) or by Type (e.g., a &#8220;Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing&#8221;) or by Class and Type (e.g., a &#8220;Term Benchmark Rate Term Borrowing&#8221;). Section 1.12.  Currency Equivalents Generally. (a) For purposes of determining compliance with Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03 with respect to any amount of Indebtedness or Investment in a currency other than Dollars, no Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of currency exchange occurring after the time such Indebtedness or Investment is incurred (so long as such Indebtedness or Investment, at the time incurred, made or acquired, was permitted hereunder). (b) For purposes of determining the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio and the Total Leverage Ratio, amounts denominated in a currency other than Dollars will be converted to Dollars at the currency exchange rates used in preparing the Borrower&#8217;s financial statements corresponding to the Test Period with respect to the applicable date of determination and will, in the case of Indebtedness, reflect the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of Swap Contracts permitted hereunder for currency exchange risks with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination of the Dollar equivalent of such Indebtedness. Section 1.13. Excluded Swap Obligations. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no Guarantee by any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall include a Guarantee of any Excluded Swap Obligation and no Collateral provided by any Loan Party shall secure any Excluded Swap Obligation.  In the event that any payment is made by, or any collection is realized from, any Loan Party for which there are Excluded Swap Obligations, or from any Collateral provided by such Loan Party, the proceeds thereof shall be applied to pay the Obligations of such Loan Party on a ratable basis determined without giving effect to such Excluded Swap Obligations and each reference in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the ratable application of such amounts as among the Obligations or any specified portion of the Obligations that would otherwise include such Excluded Swap Obligations shall be deemed so to provide. (b) Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under Article 11 and the Loan Documents in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 1.13 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 1.13, or otherwise under the Guaranty, as it relates to such Loan Party, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until its Guaranty under Article 11 is released.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 1.13 constitute, and this Section 1.13 shall be deemed to constitute, a &#8220;keepwell, support, or other agreement&#8221; for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of 77 Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act. Section 1.14. Term Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, with respect to all Term Loans other than the Initial Term Loans: (a) On March 5, 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), the regulatory supervisor of LIBOR&#8217;s administrator (&#8220;IBA&#8221;), announced in a public statement the future cessation or loss of representativeness of overnight/Spot Next, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12- month LIBOR tenor settings.  On the date that is the earlier of (the &#8220;Benchmark Transition Date&#8221;) (i) the date that all Available Tenors of LIBOR have either permanently or indefinitely ceased to be provided by IBA or have been announced by the FCA pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative and (ii) the Early Opt-in Effective Date, if the then-current Benchmark is the LIBO Rate, the Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any setting of such Benchmark on such day and all subsequent settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly or quarterly basis as determined by the Borrower from time to time prior to the commencement of the applicable interest payment period.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if another alternate benchmark rate that is a then prevailing or evolving market convention for determining a rate of interest for similar U.S. dollar credit facilities is available prior to, on or after the Benchmark Transition Date that does not constitute Daily Simple SOFR or Term SOFR, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to incorporate such alternate benchmark rate as the &#8220;Benchmark Rate&#8221; (including giving effect to any spread adjustment to such Benchmark Rate that is consistent with the prevailing market convention for similar U.S. dollar credit facilities) and make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection therewith. (a) [Reserved]. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current applicable Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any applicable Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. At any time that the administrator of the then-current applicable Benchmark has permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such Benchmark or such Benchmark has been announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative of the underlying market and economic reality that such Benchmark is intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored, the Borrower may revoke any request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans to be made, converted or continued that would bear interest by reference to such Benchmark until the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced such Benchmark, and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans.  During the period referenced in the foregoing sentence, the component of ABR based upon the applicable Benchmark will not be used in any 78 determination of the Alternate Base Rate. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, if a Term SOFR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred, then, at the election of the Borrower at any time thereafter, the Term SOFR Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that the foregoing under this clause (iii) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered a Term SOFR Notice to the Term Lenders (it being understood that upon the occurrence of a Term SOFR Transition Event, upon such mutual election of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall deliver a Term SOFR Notice to the Term Lenders). (c) [Reserved]. (d) In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time (in consultation with the Borrower) and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. (e) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower pursuant to this Section, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding  absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section. (f) At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the applicable then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or the LIBO Rate), then the Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is unavailable or non-representative for such Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (ii) the Administrative Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for such Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) clause (a) above shall not be deemed to apply with respect to the Revolving Facility and (y) the amendments set forth herein pursuant to the Eighth Amendment shall not be deemed to modify the application of clause (a) above in respect of the Term Facility. Section 1.15.Rates. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to the Alternate Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof, or any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or 79 </FONT></DIV>

The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of the Alternate Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, Adjusted Term SOFR, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain the Alternate Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, Adjusted Term SOFR or any other Benchmark, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service. ARTICLE 2 THE CREDITS Section 2.01.  Commitments.  Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties set forth herein: (a) each Term Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to (i) make an Initial Term Loan to the Borrower on the Closing Date in a principal amount not to exceed the initial amount of such Term Lender&#8217;s Term Loan Commitment (if any), (ii) make a 2018 Incremental Term Loan to the Borrower on the First Incremental Amendment Date in a principal amount not to exceed its 2018 Incremental Term Loan Commitment (if any), (iii) make a 2020 Incremental Term Loan to the Borrower on the Third Incremental Amendment Date in a principal amount not to exceed its 2020 Incremental Term Loan Commitment (if any) and (iv) make a 2021 Incremental Term Loan to the Borrower on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date in a principal amount not to exceed its 2021 Incremental Term Loan Commitment (if any); (b) each Revolving Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower, at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date until the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the termination of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment; provided that Revolving Loans shall only be made to the Borrower on the Closing Date (a) in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 to fund (i) the consideration for the Acquisition and Transaction Expenses, (ii) any original issue discount or upfront fees required to be funded on the Closing Date (including in connection with the issuance of the 2025 Unsecured Notes) and (iii) working capital, and (b) to cash collateralize letters of credit outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreements; and (c) each 2021 Extending Term Lender acknowledges that all of the Initial Term Loans held by such 2021 Extending Lender on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date were converted into 2021 Extended Term Loans as further set forth in the Sixth Amendment. 80 Amounts repaid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed. Within the limits set forth in clause (b) above and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, repay or prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. Section 2.02.  Loans. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their applicable Commitments; provided that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender).  Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 (except, with respect to any Incremental Term Loans or Other Term Loans, to the extent otherwise provided in the applicable Incremental Amendment or Refinancing Amendment) or (ii) equal to the remaining available balance of the applicable Commitments. (b) Subject to Sections 2.08, 3.02 and 3.04, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Term Benchmark Rate Loans as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03.  Each Lender may at its option make any Term Benchmark Rate Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Lender to make such Loan and the Borrower to repay such Loan to such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than ten Term Benchmark Rate Borrowings in the aggregate outstanding hereunder at any one time.  For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings. (c) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate from time to time not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an account as directed by the Borrower in the applicable Request for Credit Extension maintained with the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders within two Business Days. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(c) above and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error).  If such Lender shall 81 repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. Section 2.03.  Borrowing Procedure.  To request a Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing, the Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery or facsimile (or transmit by other electronic transmission, if arrangements for doing so have been approved in writing by the Administrative Agent), a duly completed and executed Request for Credit Extension to the Administrative Agent (i) in the case of a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing (or, in the case of the initial extension of credit on the Closing Date, one Business Day before) or (ii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing.  Each Request for Credit Extension for a Revolving Loan or a Term Loan shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  (a) whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Borrowing of Revolving Loans or Term Loans; (b) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing; (c) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; (d) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing; (e) in the case of a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221;; (f) the location and number of the Borrower&#8217;s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.02(c) and (g) if and to the extent required under Section 4.01, that the conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 4.01 are satisfied as of the date of the notice. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period with respect to any requested Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month&#8217;s duration.  Promptly following receipt of a Request for Credit Extension in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender&#8217;s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. Section 2.04.  Evidence of Debt; Repayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to (i) the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender, the principal amount of each Term Loan of such Term Lender as provided in Section 2.11 (or, in the case of Extended Term Loans, Incremental Term Loans or Other Term Loans, as provided for in the applicable Extension Offer, Incremental Amendment or Refinancing Amendment) and (ii) the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender, the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Revolving Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date (or, in the case of Extended Revolving Loans or Other Revolving Loans, as provided for in the applicable Extension Amendment or Refinancing Amendment). (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and Class thereof and, if applicable, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender&#8217;s share thereof. 82 (d) The entries made in the Register shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts pursuant to Sections 2.04(b) and 2.04(c) or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties to pay, and perform, the Obligations in accordance with the Loan Documents.  Subject to the Register, in the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such entries, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. (e) Any Lender by written notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) may request that Loans of any Class made by it hereunder be evidenced by a Note.  In such event, the Borrower shall promptly (and, in all events, within five Business Days of receipt of such written notice) prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender&#8217;s registered assigns in accordance with Section 10.04).  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and the interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment of all or part of such interests pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to such payee and its registered assigns. Section 2.05.  Fees. (a) Commitment Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee (a &#8220;Commitment Fee&#8221;) equal to 0.50% per annum of the average daily unused amount of each Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates.  Accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears (A) on the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and (B) on the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates. Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  For purposes of computing Commitment Fees, a Revolving Commitment of a Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Revolving Lender. (b) Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative fees set forth in the Fee Letter and such other fees payable in the amounts and at the times specified therein (the &#8220;Administrative Agent Fees&#8221;). (c) LC and Fronting Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to (i) the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee (&#8220;LC Participation Fee&#8221;) with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin from time to time used to determine the interest rate on Term Benchmark Rate Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 on the average daily amount of such Revolving Lender&#8217;s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to Reimbursement Obligations) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) each Issuing Bank a fronting fee (&#8220;Fronting Fee&#8221;), which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25%  per annum (or such lesser rate per annum as such Issuing Bank may from time to time agree) on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to Reimbursement Obligations) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank&#8217;s customary charges with respect to the administration, issuance, amendment, negotiation, renewal, payment or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.

Any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to each Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) shall be payable within five Business Days after demand therefor.  All LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (d) Payment of Fees. All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders, except that the Borrower shall pay the Fronting Fees directly to each Issuing Bank.  Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances. Section 2.06.  Interest on Loans.

The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Term Benchmark Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any Bankruptcy Proceeding. (e) In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR in respect of the Revolving Facility, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in 84 connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR in respect of the Revolving Facility.

Section 2.09.  Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Term Loan Commitments for the Initial Term Loans in effect on the Closing Date shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Initial Term Loans on the Closing Date.  The 2018 Incremental Term Loan Commitments for the 2018 Incremental Term Loans in effect on the First Incremental Amendment Date shall automatically terminate upon the making of the 2018 Incremental Term Loans on the First Incremental Amendment Date.

(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under Section 2.09(b) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction (which effective date shall be a Business Day), specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be irrevocable; provided that the Borrower may rescind or postpone any notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments if such termination or reduction would have resulted from a refinancing, which refinancing shall not be consummated or otherwise shall be delayed.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class. Section 2.10.  Conversion and Continuation of Borrowings. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Request for Credit Extension and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Request for Credit Extension.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.10.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Borrower shall be entitled to request any conversion or continuation that, if made, would result in more than ten Term Benchmark Rate Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any one time. (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.10, the Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery or facsimile (or transmit by other electronic transmission if arrangements for doing so have been approved in writing by the Administrative Agent), a duly completed and executed Interest Election Request to the Administrative Agent not later than the time that a Request for Credit Extension would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable. (c) Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, or if outstanding Borrowings are being combined, allocation to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing; and 86 (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term &#8220;Interest Period&#8221;; If any such Interest Election Request requests a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month&#8217;s duration. (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender&#8217;s portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) If an Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Rate Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.

(c) With respect to each Class of Term Loans, each prepayment pursuant to Section 2.13(a) shall be applied in direct order of maturity; and each such prepayment shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, subject to Section 2.13(d).  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.13(c) is applicable to any prepayment made with the Net Proceeds of Indebtedness permitted under clause (i) of Section 7.03(t) or clause (i) of Section 7.03(u).

Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of the contents of the Borrower&#8217;s prepayment notice and of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share of the prepayment.

If a Term Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of Term Loans unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree to an extension of time for such failure to be corrected.  Subject to the terms of the documentation evidencing any Second Lien Indebtedness, any Declined Proceeds shall be retained by the Borrower. (e) Funding Losses, Etc.  All prepayments under this Section 2.13 shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be prepaid to but excluding the date of payment and shall be made together with, in the case of any such prepayment of a Term Benchmark Rate Loan on a day prior to the last day of an Interest Period therefor, any amounts owing in respect of such Term Benchmark Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.05.

(g) In the event and on such occasion that the aggregate amount of Revolving Exposure exceeds the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments then in effect, then the Borrower shall immediately prepay the outstanding Revolving Loans and Cash Collateralize the aggregate amount of the LC Exposure in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. Section 2.14.  Pro Rata Treatment. (a) Subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing payment to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders and except as required under Section 3.02, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each payment of the LC Participation Fees, each reduction of the Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of the applicable Class in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans); provided that the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) in respect of any payment, assignment, sale or participation to Holdings or any of their respective Affiliates expressly permitted under Section 10.04.  Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender&#8217;s portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender&#8217;s percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, Reimbursement Obligations, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably 92 among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and Reimbursement Obligations then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and Reimbursement Obligations then due to such parties. Section 2.15.  Sharing of Setoffs.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim (including pursuant to Section 10.06) or otherwise (including by exercise of its rights under the Collateral Documents), obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.15 shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any Eligible Assignee or participant.  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Legal Requirements, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.  If under applicable Insolvency Law any Secured Party receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff or counterclaim to which this Section 2.15 applies, such Secured Party shall to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights to which the Secured Party is entitled under this Section 2.15 to share in the benefits of the recovery of such secured claim. Section 2.16.  Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or Reimbursement Obligations, or of amounts payable under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05, or otherwise) on or before the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 520 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10022 Attention: Surgery Partners Account Manager.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, unless specified otherwise, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars. 93 (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or each Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or each Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules or practices on interbank compensation. (c) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.16(b), 2.17(d), 2.17(e) or 10.05(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender&#8217;s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. Section 2.17. Letters of Credit. (a) General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request an Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank agrees, to issue Letters of Credit for its own account or the account of a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case to support payment and performance obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (provided that the Borrower shall be a co-applicant, and be jointly and severally liable, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for the account of its Restricted Subsidiary); provided that Letters of Credit may be issued on the Closing Date solely to backstop or replace Existing Letters of Credit and other guarantees and performance and similar bonds outstanding on the Closing Date and described in Schedule 2.17.  An Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue, and no Borrower shall request the issuance of, any Letter of Credit at any time if after giving effect to such issuance, the LC Exposure would exceed the LC Commitment or the total Revolving Exposure would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.  No Issuing Bank shall be required to issue Letters of Credit (or have Existing Letters of Credit outstanding) in excess of the amount set forth opposite its name on Schedule 2.02 (as may be amended from time to time).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Schedule 2.02 may be amended with the consent of Borrower and each Issuing Bank that would be directly affected by such amendment, with notice to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue commercial Letters of Credit and (y) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue a Letter of Credit in any currency other than Dollars.

If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank&#8217;s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit; provided that the provisions of this Section 2.17 shall apply in respect of all such applications.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and, upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Commitment, (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments and (iii) the conditions set forth in Article 4 in respect of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension shall have been satisfied.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">(c) Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (x) the date which is one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (y) the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided that this Section 2.17(c) shall not prevent any Issuing Bank from agreeing that a Letter of Credit will automatically be extended for one or more successive periods not to exceed one year each (and, in any case, not to extend beyond the Letter of Credit Expiration Date) unless each such Issuing Bank elects not to extend for any such additional period. (d) Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, any Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.17(e), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.17(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever (so long as such payment shall not cause such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Exposure to exceed such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment). (e) Reimbursement. (i) If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the next Business Day following the Business Day on which the Borrower shall have received notice from such Issuing Bank that payment of such draft will be made. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share thereof.  Each Revolving Lender shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date (or, if such Revolving Lender shall have received such notice later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on any day, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day), an amount equal to such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the unreimbursed LC Disbursement in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender, and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from the Borrower pursuant to the above paragraph prior to the time that any Revolving Lender makes any payment pursuant to the preceding sentence and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower thereafter will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made such payments and to such Issuing Bank, as appropriate. 96 (ii) If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, or if the amount is not financed pursuant to the proviso to Section 2.17(e)(i), the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share thereof.  Each Revolving Lender shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date (or, if such Revolving Lender shall have received such notice later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on any day, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day), an amount equal to such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the unreimbursed LC Disbursement in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender, and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from the Borrower pursuant to the above paragraph prior to the time that any Revolving Lender makes any payment pursuant to the preceding sentence and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower thereafter will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made such payments and to such Issuing Bank, as appropriate. (iii) If any Revolving Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata Share of such LC Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above, the Borrower and such Revolving Lender severally agree to pay interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date such amount is required to be paid in accordance with the foregoing to but excluding the date such amount is paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (i) of this Section 2.17(e), then the Default Rate shall apply and (ii) in the case of such Lender, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules or practices on interbank compensation. (f) Obligations Absolute.  The Reimbursement Obligations of the Borrower as provided in Section 2.17(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein; (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit being proved to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (iii) prepayment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that fails to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.17, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of the Borrower hereunder; 97 (v) the fact that a Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (vi) any material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise), material agreements, properties, solvency, business, management, prospects or value of any Company; or (vii) any other fact, circumstance or event whatsoever. None of the Agents, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank or any of their Affiliates shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential, exemplary, special, punitive or other indirect damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by any Issuing Bank&#8217;s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Bank (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable decision) with respect to such a determination, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (g) Disbursement Procedures.  Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly give written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its Reimbursement Obligation to such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement (other than with respect to the timing of such Reimbursement Obligation set forth in Section 2.17(e)). (h) Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is due, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest payable on demand, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is due to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the Default Rate.  Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 2.17(h) shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(e) to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (i) Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders 98 (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.17(i), the Borrower shall deposit in an account (the &#8220;LC Sub-Account&#8221;), in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 103% of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to Holdings or the Borrower described in Section 8.01(f) or 8.01(g).  Funds in the LC Sub-Account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of outstanding Reimbursement Obligations or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations of the Borrower in accordance with Article 9.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount plus any accrued interest with respect to such amounts (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall, in accordance with Article 9, be returned to the Borrower within 10 Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. (j) Additional Issuing Banks.  The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders or Affiliates of Revolving Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement, with the consent of each of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Revolving Lender(s).  Any Revolving Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this Section 2.17(j) shall be deemed (in addition to being a Revolving Lender) to be the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Revolving Lender, and all references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term &#8220;Issuing Bank&#8221; shall, with respect to such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Revolving Lender in its capacity as Issuing Bank, as the context shall require. (k) Resignation or Removal of the Issuing Bank.  Any Issuing Bank may resign as Issuing Bank hereunder at any time upon at least 30 days&#8217; prior written notice to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.  Following such resignation, such Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of such Issuing Bank or any such additional Issuing Bank.  At the time any such resignation or replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c).  From and after the effective date of any such resignation or replacement or addition, as applicable, (i) the successor or additional Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term &#8220;Issuing Bank&#8221; shall be deemed to refer to such successor or such addition or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor or such addition and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the resignation or replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  If at any time there is more than one Issuing Bank hereunder, the Borrower may, in its discretion, select which Issuing Bank is to issue any particular Letter of Credit. (l) Other.  No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: (i) any Order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Legal 99 </FONT></DIV>

(m) No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

Section 2.18 Defaulting Lenders.  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then (i) during any Default Period (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a &#8220;Lender&#8221;, and the amount of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment and Revolving Loans and/or Term Loan Commitments, 2018 Incremental Term Loan Commitments, 2020 Incremental Term Loan Commitments, 2021 Incremental Term Loan Commitments and Term Loans shall be excluded for purposes of voting, and the calculation of voting, on any matters (including the granting of any consents or waivers) with respect to any of the Loan Documents, except that the amount of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment and Revolving Loans and/or Term Loan Commitments, 2018 Incremental Term Loan Commitments, 2020 Incremental Term Loan Commitments, 2021 Incremental Term Loan Commitments and Term Loans shall be included for purposes of voting, and the calculation of voting, on the matters set forth in Section 10.08(b)(i) through 10.08(b)(ix) (including the granting of any consents or waivers) only to the extent that any such matter disproportionately affects such Defaulting Lender; (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, until such time as the Default Excess (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, (A) any voluntary prepayment of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall, if the Borrower so directs at the time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Loans and the Revolving Exposure of other Lenders in accordance with Section 2.10(a) as if such Defaulting Lender had no Loans outstanding and the Revolving Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were zero, and (B) any mandatory prepayment of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.10 shall, if the Borrower so directs at the time of making such mandatory prepayment, be applied to the Loans and Revolving Exposure of other Lenders (but not to the Loans and Revolving Exposure of such Defaulting Lender) in accordance with Section 2.10 as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender, it being understood and agreed that the Borrower shall be entitled to retain any portion of any mandatory prepayment of the Loans that is not paid to such Defaulting Lender solely as a result of the operation of the provisions of this clause (B); (iii) the amount of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment, Revolving Loans and LC Exposure shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the Commitment Fee payable to Revolving Lenders pursuant to Section 2.05(a) in respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee pursuant to Section 2.05(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Revolving 100 Commitment in respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender; (iv) if any LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:  (A) all or any part of such LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the Revolving Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments but, in any case, only to the extent the sum of the Revolving Exposures of all Revolving Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders does not exceed the total of the Revolving Commitments of all Revolving Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders; (B) if the reallocation described in clause (A) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.18(i) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; (C) if the Borrower Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s LC Exposure pursuant to this clause (iv), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any LC Participation Fee to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(c) with respect to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s LC Exposure is cash collateralized; (D) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this clause (iv), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders&#8217; reallocated LC Exposure; and (E) if any Defaulting Lender&#8217;s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this clause (iv), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Banks or any Lender hereunder, all Commitment Fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and LC Participation Fee payable under Section 2.05 with respect to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Banks until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; (v) except for purposes of calculating the aggregate Revolving Exposure pursuant to Section 2.09(b), the Revolving Exposure of all Lenders as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender; and (vi) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with clause (iv) of this Section 2.16(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (iv)(A) of this Section 2.16(c) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).  In the event that each of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, and the Issuing Banks agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure and Revolving Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender&#8217;s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Revolving Commitment. No amount of the Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 2.16(c), performance by the Borrower of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result of any Funding Default or the operation of Section 2.16(c).  The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under Section 2.16(c) are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default and that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default. The Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender upon not less than 10 Business Days&#8217; prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which will promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.14 will apply to all amounts 101 thereafter paid by the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts); provided, that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any non-Defaulting Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender. Section 2.19.  Incremental Credit Extensions. (a) The Borrower may at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent (whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly make a copy of such notice available to each of the Lenders), request one or more additional tranches or, in consultation with the Administrative Agent, additions to an existing tranche of term loans (the &#8220;Incremental Term Loans&#8221;; the commitments thereunder, the &#8220;Incremental Term Loan Commitments&#8221;) or one or more increases in the amount of the Revolving Commitment (any such increase, a &#8220;Revolving Commitment Increase&#8221;; the commitments thereunder, the &#8220;Incremental Revolving Commitments&#8221; and, collectively, with the Incremental Term Loan Commitments, the &#8220;Incremental Commitments&#8221;); provided that (i) after giving effect to the making of such Incremental Term Loans or the incurrence of any Revolving Commitment Increase, the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments incurred pursuant to this Section 2.19 (together with any Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred pursuant to Section 7.03(s) after the Closing Date) shall not exceed (x) $346,000,000 (provided that $35,000,000 of such amount under this clause (x) shall solely be available for Revolving Commitment Increases) plus (y) an unlimited additional amount, so long as on a Pro Forma Basis after the incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans and such Incremental Revolving Commitments (A) if such Incremental Loan ranks pari passu in right of security on the Collateral with the Obligations (other than any Obligations in respect of other Incremental Loans or Refinancing Facilities secured on a junior lien basis to other Obligations), the First Lien Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the most recently ended Test Period does not exceed 3.90:1.00 and (B) if such Incremental Loan ranks junior in right of security on the Collateral to the Obligations  (other than any Obligations in respect of other Incremental Loans or Refinancing Facilities secured on a junior lien basis to other Obligations), the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the most recently ended Test Period does not exceed 3.90:1.00 (it being understood that (1) any Incremental Loan may be incurred under clause (y) prior to clause (x) and regardless of whether there is capacity under clause (x), (2) to the extent that both clause (x) and clause (y) are available and the Borrower does not make an election, the Borrower will be deemed to have elected clause (y), (3) any amounts incurred under clause (x), the Revolving Facility, Sections 7.03(e), 7.03(m), 7.03(r), 7.03(t), 7.03(u), 7.03(z), 7.03(bb), 7.03(s)(x) or 7.03(w), in each case, together with any amounts incurred to fund original issue discount (&#8220;OID&#8221;) and upfront fees, that is concurrently incurred with, or incurred in a single transaction or series of related transactions with, amounts under clause (y) will not count as Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating the First Lien Leverage Ratio or Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, in clause (y) and (4) any portion of any Incremental Term Loans or any Incremental Revolving Commitments incurred in reliance on clause (x) may be reclassified, as the Borrower may elect from time to time, as incurred under clause (y) if the Borrower meets the applicable First Lien Leverage Ratio or Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, under clause (y) at such time on a Pro Forma Basis (for purposes of clarity, with any such reclassification having the effect of increasing the Borrower&#8217;s ability to incur Indebtedness under clause (x) on and after the date of such reclassification by the amount of Indebtedness so reclassified)); provided, further, that for purposes of the calculation of the First Lien Leverage Ratio and the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio used in determining the availability of Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Commitments under this Section 2.19(a), (i) any cash proceeds of any Incremental Term Loans or the Incremental Revolving Commitments, as applicable, then being incurred will not be netted for purposes of determining compliance with the First Lien Leverage Ratio or Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and (ii) the full amount of any Incremental Revolving Commitments then being incurred shall be deemed to be Indebtedness then outstanding (whether or not then incurred).

(b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise, property, intangible or mortgage recording taxes, or charges or levies of the same character, imposed by any Governmental Authority, which arise from any payment 110 made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (including additions to tax, penalties and interest related thereto) excluding in each case, such amounts that result from an Agent or Lender&#8217;s Assignment and Acceptance, grant of a Participation, transfer or assignment to or designation of a new applicable lending office or other office for receiving payments under any Loan Document (collectively, &#8220;Assignment Taxes&#8221;) except for Assignment Taxes resulting from assignments or participations that are requested or required in writing by the Borrower (all such non-excluded taxes described in this Section 3.01(b) being hereinafter referred to as &#8220;Other Taxes&#8221;). (c) The Borrower and each Guarantor agree to indemnify each Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes paid by such Agent or Lender and (ii) any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, provided such Agent or Lender, as the case may be, provides the Borrower with a written statement thereof setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) or by an Agent (on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Each Lender and Agent shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with any documentation prescribed by Law certifying as to any entitlement of such Lender or Agent to an exemption from, or reduction in, withholding tax with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender under the Loan Documents.  Each such Lender and Agent shall, whenever a lapse in time, a change in law, or change in circumstances renders any previously delivered documentation obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the applicable withholding agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to do so. Unless the applicable withholding agent has received forms or other documents satisfactory to it indicating that payments under any Loan Document to or for a Lender or Agent are not subject to withholding tax or are subject to such Tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent shall withhold amounts required to be withheld by applicable Law from such payments at the applicable statutory rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this clause (d) that such Lender is not legally able to deliver (other than the forms under Section 3.01(d)(i) and 3.01(d)(ii) below).  Without limiting the foregoing: (i) Each Lender and Agent that is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender or Agent (as the case may be) is exempt from federal backup withholding; provided, however, that if such Lender or Agent is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it shall provide the appropriate withholding form of its owner (together with appropriate supporting documentation). (ii) Each Lender and Agent that is not a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement whichever of the following is applicable: (A) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, and such other documentation as required under the Code, 111 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">(B) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms) and, in the case of an Agent that is not a United States person, a withholding certificate that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) and 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v) as applicable to a U.S. branch that has agreed to be treated as a U.S. person for withholding tax purposes, (C) in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1, G-2, G-3 or G-4, as applicable (any such certificate a &#8220;United States Tax Compliance Certificate&#8221;) and (B) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, or (D) to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Lender is a partnership, or is a participant holding a participation granted by a participating Lender), Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, a United States Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY or any other required information from each beneficial owner, as applicable (provided that, if one or more beneficial owners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United States Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such Lender on behalf of such beneficial owner). (E) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender&#8217;s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (E), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender and Agent shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further original copies of any previously delivered form or certification (or any applicable successor form) on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate and promptly after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is unable to do so.  Each Lender and Agent shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered form or certification to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. (e) Any Lender or Agent claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.01 shall use its reasonable efforts (at the request of the Borrower) to change the jurisdiction of its lending office (or take any other measures reasonably requested by the Borrower) if such a change or 112 other measures would reduce any such additional amounts (or any similar amount that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, result in any unreimbursed cost or expense or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender; provided that all costs relating to such change or other measures shall be borne by the Borrower. (f) If any Lender or Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid to it by the Borrower or Guarantor pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such refund to the Borrower or Guarantor, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund net of any Taxes payable by any Agent or Lender on such interest); provided that the Borrower and Guarantors, upon the request of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agree promptly to return such refund (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund to the relevant Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of such amount would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other person. (g) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(f) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Taxes excluded from the definition of Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (g). (h) Each party&#8217;s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 113 Section 3.02.  Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Term Benchmark Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the applicable Term Benchmark Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue the applicable Term Benchmark Rate Loans or to convert ABR Loans to the applicable Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all applicable Term Benchmark Rate Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Rate Loans to such day, or promptly, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Rate Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted and all amounts due, if any, in connection with such prepayment or conversion under Section 3.05.  Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Section 3.03.  [Reserved]. Section 3.04.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Term Benchmark Rate Loans. (a) If any Lender or Issuing Bank reasonably determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case after the Closing Date, or such Lender&#8217;s or Issuing Bank&#8217;s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Term Benchmark Rate Loans or maintaining any Letter of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.04(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01, or any Taxes excluded from the definition of Indemnified Taxes under exception (iii) thereof to the extent such Taxes are imposed on or measured by net income or profits or are franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of the foregoing taxes) or any Taxes excluded from the definition of Indemnified Taxes under exceptions (i), (ii), (iv), (v) or (vi) thereof or (ii) reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(c) or reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Term Benchmark Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligations to make any Loan), or the cost to such Issuing Bank of maintaining any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank, then from time to time within 15 days after demand by such Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank for such increased cost or reduction. (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its lending office) or Issuing Bank therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or Issuing Bank or any entity controlling such Lender or Issuing Bank as a consequence of its obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity and its desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the 114 Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or controlling entity for such reduction within 15 days after receipt of such demand. (c) Except to the extent already reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurodollar funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each applicable Eurodollar Loan of the Borrower equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of any Eurodollar Loans of the Borrower, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided that the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days&#8217; prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or cost from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or cost shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice. (c) [Reserved]. (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of its right to demand such compensation. (e) If any Lender or Issuing Bank requests compensation under this Section 3.04, then such Lender or Issuing Bank will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another lending office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or Issuing Bank, cause such Lender or Issuing Bank and its lending office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; provided, further, that nothing in this Section 3.04(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.04(a), 3.04(b), 3.04(c) or 3.04(d). Section 3.05.  Funding Losses.  Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by it as a result of: (i) any continuation or conversion of any Term Benchmark Rate Loan of the Borrower on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan, or any payment or prepayment of any Term Benchmark Rate Loan of the Borrower on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or (ii) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Term Benchmark Rate Loan of the Borrower on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; 115 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">including, to the extent applicable, an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (1) its cost of obtaining funds for the Term Benchmark Rate Loan that is the subject of such event for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan over (2) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason of such event for such period, but excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin. Section 3.06.  Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. (a) Any Agent or any Lender or Issuing Bank claiming compensation under this Article 3 shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. (b) With respect to any Lender&#8217;s or Issuing Bank&#8217;s claim for compensation under Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.04, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate it for any amount incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that it notifies the Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim; provided that, if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  If any Lender or Issuing Bank requests compensation by the Borrower under Section 3.04, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue from one Interest Period to another any applicable Term Benchmark Rate Loan, or, if applicable, to convert ABR Loans into Term Benchmark Rate Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.06(c) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. (c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or continue any Term Benchmark Rate Loan, or to convert ABR Loans into Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.06(b) hereof, such Lender&#8217;s applicable Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be automatically converted into ABR Loans (or, if such conversion is not possible, repaid) on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Term Benchmark Rate Loans (or, in the case of an immediate conversion required by Section 3.02, on such earlier date as required by Law) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.02 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist: (i) to the extent that such Lender&#8217;s Term Benchmark Rate Loans have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender&#8217;s applicable Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be applied instead to its ABR Loans; and (ii) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued from one Interest Period to another by such Lender as Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be made or continued instead as ABR Loans (if possible), and all ABR Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be converted into Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall remain as ABR Loans. (d) If any Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.02 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of any of such Lender&#8217;s Term Benchmark Rate Loans pursuant to this Section 3.06 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Term Benchmark Rate Loans made by other Lenders under the applicable Facility are outstanding, if applicable, such Lender&#8217;s ABR Loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) 116 for such outstanding Term Benchmark Rate Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Term Benchmark Rate Loans under such Facility and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments for the applicable Facility. (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall be deemed to have been adopted or made after the Closing Date, regardless of the date enacted or adopted. Section 3.07.  Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances. (a) If at any time (i) the Borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts or indemnity payments described in Section 3.01 or 3.04 as a result of any condition described in such Sections or any Lender ceases to make any Term Benchmark Rate Loans as a result of any condition described in Section 3.02 or Section 3.04 or (ii) any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender or a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, on 10 Business Days&#8217; prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (x) replace such Lender by causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to Section 10.04(b) (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) (it being understood that any such assignment shall become effective only in accordance with Section 10.04(e)), all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (in respect of any applicable Facility only in the case of clause (i) or, with respect to a Class vote, clause (ii)) to one or more Eligible Assignees; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender or other such Person; provided, further, that (A) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (B) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable Eligible Assignees shall have agreed to, and shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of, the applicable departure, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents; or (y) terminate the Commitment of such Lender and repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date; provided that, in the case of any such termination of a Non-Consenting Lender such termination shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of the applicable departure, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents and such termination shall be in respect of any applicable Facility only in the case of clause (i) or, with respect to a Class vote, clause (ii); (b) In the event that (i) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of each Lender, each affected Lender, each Lender with respect to a certain Class of Loans or each affected Lender with respect to a certain Class of Loans, in each case in accordance with Section 10.08, and (iii) the Required Lenders (in the case of a consent, waiver or amendment involving all Lenders or all affected Lenders of a certain Class, the Required Class Lenders) and, if applicable, the Required Revolving Lenders and the Required Term Lenders have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a &#8220;Non-Consenting Lender&#8221;. 117 (c) Any Lender being replaced pursuant to Section 3.07(a) above shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such Lender&#8217;s applicable Commitment and outstanding Loans, and (ii) deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or Administrative Agent. Pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (A) the assignee Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the assigning Lender&#8217;s outstanding Loans, (B) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the assigning Lender relating to the Loans and participations so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such assigning Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Acceptance and (C) upon such payment and, the assignment being recorded in the Register as provided in Section 10.04(e), the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender.  In connection with any such replacement, if any such Non-Consenting Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance reflecting such replacement within five Business Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Acceptance to such Non-Consenting Lender, then such Non-Consenting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance without any action on the part of the Non-Consenting Lender. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with Article 9. Section 3.08.  Survival.  All of the Borrower&#8217;s obligations under this Article 3 shall survive termination of the Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. ARTICLE 4 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS Section 4.01.  All Credit Extensions After The Closing Date.  The obligation of each Lender and Issuing Bank to honor any request for a Credit Extension (other than (i) a Request for Credit Extension requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation of Term Benchmark Rate Loans and (ii) any Request for Credit Extension under an Incremental Facility pursuant to Section 2.19) after the Closing Date is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with Section 10.08) of the following conditions precedent: (a) The representations and warranties set forth in Article 5 and in each other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such Credit Extension with the same effect as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date; provided that any such representation and warranty that is qualified by &#8220;materiality&#8221;, &#8220;material adverse effect&#8221; or similar language shall be true and correct in all respects (after giving effect to such qualification therein) on and as of the date of such Credit Extension with the same effect as though made on and as of such date or such earlier date, as applicable.

Section 6.14.  Designation of Subsidiaries.

The designation of any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date shall constitute an Investment by the Borrower therein at the date of designation in an amount equal to the fair market value of the aggregate investment therein of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable) investment therein. The designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary shall constitute (i) the incurrence at the time of designation of any Investment, Indebtedness or Liens of such Subsidiary existing at such time and (ii) a return on any Investment by the Borrower in Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the preceding sentence in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the fair market value at the date of such designation of the Borrower&#8217;s or its Restricted Subsidiary&#8217;s (as applicable) Investment in such Subsidiary and (y) the amount of the Investment originally made in respect of the designation of such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary. (b) If, at any time, a Restricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements set forth in the definition of &#8220;Qualified Restricted Subsidiary&#8221;, it will thereafter cease to be a Qualified Restricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Qualified Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 7.03, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred and be continuing. A Responsible Officer of the Borrower may at any time designate any Restricted Subsidiary to not be a Qualified Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by such Qualified Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 7.03 and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence upon or following such designation. In the event (x) a Restricted Subsidiary fails to meet the requirements to be a Qualified Restricted Subsidiary or (y) a Responsible Officer designates a Qualified Restricted Subsidiary not to be a Restricted Subsidiary, then all Investments in such Subsidiary since the Effective Date shall consequently reduce applicable basket amounts hereunder. The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer setting forth any such designation as a condition precedent to such designation. 138 (c) Except to the extent restricted pursuant to any Permitted Payment Restrictions, cause each Qualified Restricted Subsidiary to declare and pay regular monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual dividends or distributions to the holders of its Equity Interests in an amount equal to substantially all of the available cash flow of such Qualified Restricted Subsidiary for such period as determined in good faith by the board of directors of such Qualified Restricted Subsidiary, subject to fiduciary duties applicable to such board of directors and such ordinary and customary reserves and other amounts as, in the good faith judgment of such individuals, may be necessary so that the business of such Qualified Restricted Subsidiary may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times, including amounts for operations, Capital Expenditures and debt service of such Qualified Restricted Subsidiary. Section 6.15.  Maintenance of Ratings.  Use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain (i) a public corporate rating (but not any specific rating) and a public corporate family rating (but not any specific rating) from each of S&amp;P and Moody&#8217;s, in each case in respect of the Borrower and (ii) a public rating (but not any specific rating) from each of S&amp;P and Moody&#8217;s with respect to the &#8220;2021 New Term Loans&#8221;. Section 6.16.  Use of Proceeds.  Use the proceeds of the Loans only (i) for the purposes set forth in Section 5.21 and request the issuance of Letters of Credit only to support payment and performance obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and (ii) in the case of Existing Letters of Credit, for the purposes set forth in the documentation governing such Existing Letters of Credit. ARTICLE 7 NEGATIVE COVENANTS So long as any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder or any Loan, LC Disbursement or other Obligation (other than obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements or in respect of Secured Cash Management Services Obligations or contingent indemnification obligations as to which no claim has been asserted) hereunder which is accrued or payable shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied, or any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding (unless the obligations thereunder have been Cash Collateralized or as to which other arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank have been made) then from and after the Closing Date: Section 7.01.  Liens.  The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property, assets or revenues, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than the following: (a) Liens created pursuant to any Loan Document; (b) Liens existing on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date and listed on Schedule 7.01(b); provided that (i) the Lien does not extend to any additional property other than (A) after-acquired property that is affixed or incorporated into the property covered by such Lien and (B) proceeds and products thereof, and (ii) such Lien does not secure any obligation other than those it secured on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date or, to the extent constituting Indebtedness, any Permitted Refinancing of the Indebtedness secured thereby on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date; (c) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges that are not overdue for a period of more than 30 days and are not otherwise delinquent or that are being contested in good faith and by appropriate actions, if adequate reserves with respect thereto are maintained on the books of the applicable Person in accordance with GAAP; 139 </FONT></DIV>

Any material provision of any Loan Document, at any time after its execution and delivery and for any reason other than as expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder (including as a result of a transaction permitted under Section 7.04 or 7.05) or as a result of acts or omissions by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent or any Lender or the satisfaction in full of all the Obligations, ceases to be in full force and effect or legally valid, binding and enforceable against any party thereto (or against any Person on whose behalf any such party makes any covenants or agreements therein) (other than the Secured Parties); or any Loan Party contests in writing the validity or enforceability of any provision of any Loan Document or the validity or priority of a Lien as required by the Collateral Documents on a material portion of the Collateral; or any Loan Party denies in writing that it has any or further liability or obligation under any Loan Document (other than as a result of repayment in full of the Obligations), or purports in writing to revoke or rescind any Loan Document; or (j) Change of Control.

Section 8.03. Exclusion of Immaterial Subsidiaries.  Solely for the purpose of determining whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred under Section 8.01(f) or 8.01(g), any reference in any such clause to any Restricted Subsidiary or Loan Party shall be deemed not to include any Restricted Subsidiary affected by any event or circumstances referred to in any such clause that constitutes an Immaterial Subsidiary. Section 8.04. Application of Funds.  After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any amounts received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order (to the fullest extent permitted by mandatory provisions of applicable Law): First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (other than principal and interest, but including Attorney Costs payable under Section 10.05 and amounts payable under Article 3) payable to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as such; Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs payable under Section 10.05 and amounts payable under Article 3), ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to them; Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting (i) unpaid principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Term Loan, (ii) unpaid principal of, and accrued and unpaid 166 interest on, the Revolving Loans and LC Disbursements or in respect of any Secured Cash Management Services Obligations and any breakage, termination or other payments under Secured Hedge Agreements, and any fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments due under Secured Hedge Agreements or in respect of Secured Cash Management Services Obligations, ratably among the Secured Parties in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them; Fourth to the payment of all other Obligations of the Borrower that are due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such date; and Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amount received from any Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligation of such Guarantor. Section 8.05.  Holdings&#8217; Right to Cure. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.01 or 8.02, for the purpose of determining whether an Event of Default under the covenant set forth in Section 7.11 has occurred, the Borrower may on one or more occasions designate any Specified Equity Contribution made to Holdings (all of the cash proceeds of which shall, on or prior to the tenth Business Day after the date on which financial statements are required to be delivered with respect to the applicable Test Period hereunder, be advanced to the Borrower as a cash contribution to the common equity of the Borrower) as an increase to Consolidated EBITDA with respect to such applicable Test Period and each subsequent Test Period that includes the last fiscal quarter of the Test Period immediately prior to the net cash proceeds from such Specified Equity Contribution being received by the Borrower; provided that such net cash proceeds (i) are actually received by the Borrower as cash common equity (including through capital contribution of such net cash proceeds to the Borrower) no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which financial statements are required to be delivered with respect to such Test Period hereunder and (ii) are identified as a Specified Equity Contribution in a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent.  The parties hereby acknowledge that this Section 8.05 may not be relied on for purposes of calculating any financial ratios (or for any other purpose hereunder) other than solely for purposes of determining compliance with Section 7.11 and shall not result in any adjustment to any amounts other than the amount of the Consolidated EBITDA referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. (b) (i) In each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, there shall be at least two fiscal quarters in which no Specified Equity Contribution is made, (ii) no more than five Specified Equity Contributions may be made in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, (iii) the amount of any Specified Equity Contribution shall be no more than the amount required to cause the Borrower to be in compliance with Section 7.11 for the relevant fiscal quarter, (iv) all Specified Equity Contributions shall be disregarded for the purposes of determining any pricing, financial ratio-based conditions or availability or any baskets with respect to the covenants contained in this Agreement, (v) the net cash proceeds of any such Specified Equity Contribution shall have been contributed to the Borrower as cash equity and (vi) there shall be no pro forma reduction in Indebtedness or Consolidated Total Net Debt with the proceeds of any Specified Equity Contribution for determining compliance with Section 7.11 for any fiscal quarter in which such Specified Equity Contribution is included in Consolidated EBITDA.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">shall be in compliance with Section 7.11, the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of Section 7.11 as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable existing breach of Section 7.11 shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.01 or 8.02, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender may exercise any rights or remedies under Section 8.02 (or any other Loan Document) on the basis of any actual or purported Event of Default under Section 7.11 (or any other Default as a result thereof) until and unless the Cure Expiration Date has occurred without the Specified Equity Contribution having been designated and the cash proceeds thereof having been advanced to the Borrower as a cash contribution to the common equity of the Borrower. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default under Section 7.11 would have occurred and been continuing had Holdings not had the option to exercise the cure right as set forth in this Section 8.05 and not exercised such cure right pursuant to this Section 8.05, the Borrower shall not be permitted, at any time while such Event of Default under Section 7.11 has occurred and is continuing and prior to the earlier of (x) the receipt of the cash proceeds by the Borrower as provided in Section 8.05(a) or (y) the Cure Expiration Date, to request any Credit Extension (other than a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation of Term Benchmark Rate Loans) under this Agreement. ARTICLE 9 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT Section 9.01.  Appointment. (a) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (for purposes of this Article 9, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are referred to collectively as the &#8220;Agents&#8221;) as an agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank irrevocably authorizes each Agent, in such capacity, through its agents or employees, to take such actions on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are delegated to such Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Other than with respect to Section 9.05, 9.12 and 9.13, the provisions of this Article 9 are solely for the benefit of the Agents, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and no Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents are hereby expressly authorized to (i) execute any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the Collateral and any rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) negotiate, enforce or settle any claim, action or proceeding affecting the Lenders in their capacity as such, at the direction of the Required Lenders, which negotiation, enforcement or settlement will be binding upon each Lender.  In performing its functions and duties hereunder, each Agent shall act solely as an agent of the Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for Holdings, the Borrower or any of its respective Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; in this Agreement with reference to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. (b) Each Lender irrevocably appoints each other Lender as its agent and bailee for the purpose of perfecting Liens (whether pursuant to Section 8-301(a)(2) of the UCC or otherwise), for the 168 benefit of the Secured Parties, in assets in which, in accordance with the UCC or any other applicable Laws or regulations a security interest can be perfected by possession or control.  Should any Lender (other than the Collateral Agent) obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and, promptly following the Collateral Agent&#8217;s request therefor, shall deliver such Collateral to the Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Collateral Agent&#8217;s instructions.  The Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree that the Collateral Agent may act, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor or subordination agreement as the collateral agent for the Lenders. Section 9.02. Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  Each Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; or &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the person serving as an Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder and without duty to account therefor to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks. Section 9.03. Exculpatory Provisions.  No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.08); provided that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability, if the Agent is not indemnified to its satisfactory, or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Laws or regulations including, for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a foreclosure, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender under any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose nor shall any Agent be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as any Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.08) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment.  No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof describing such Default or Event of Default, as applicable, is given to such Agent by Holdings, the Borrower, the Issuing Banks or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.  Each party to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent may from time to time use one or more outside 169 service providers for the tracking of all UCC financing statements (and/or other collateral related filings and registrations from time to time) required to be filed or recorded pursuant to the Loan Documents and the notification to the Administrative Agent, of, among other things, the upcoming lapse or expiration thereof, and that each of such service providers will be deemed to be acting at the request and on behalf of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties.  No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by any such service provider.  Neither any Agent nor any of its officers, partners, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted by any Agent under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents. Section 9.04. Reliance by Agent.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent, or otherwise authenticated by a proper Person. Each Agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by a proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Bank unless each Agent shall have received written notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other advisors selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or advisors. Section 9.05. Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document by or through, or delegate any and all such rights and powers to, any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent; provided, however, that any such sub-agent receiving payments from the Loan Parties shall be a &#8220;U.S. person&#8221; and a &#8220;financial institution&#8221; within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1441-1.  Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties; provided, however, that any such Related Party of the Agent and sub-agent receiving payments from the Loan Parties shall be a &#8220;U.S. person&#8221; and a &#8220;financial institution&#8221; within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1441-1.  The exculpatory, indemnification and other provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply, without limiting the foregoing, to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.  The Agents shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent. Section 9.06. Successor Agent. (a) Each Agent may resign as such at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with, unless an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f) or 8.01(g) has occurred and is continuing, the approval of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a U.S. bank with an office in the United States to which all payments made by the Loan Parties hereunder shall be made.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which 170 shall be a U.S. bank with an office in New York, New York or an Affiliate of such bank in the United States to which all payments made by the Loan Parties shall be made.  If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence within 30 days after the date such notice of resignation was given by such Agent, such Agent&#8217;s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the retiring (or retired) Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents, and the Required Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent. (b) Upon the acceptance of its appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring (or retired) Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After an Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article 9 and Section 10.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent. Section 9.07. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent, Lender, Issuing Bank or any of their respective Affiliates and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, conducted its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries and made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender further represents and warrants that it has reviewed the Confidential Information Memorandum and each other document made available to it on the Platform in connection with this Agreement and has acknowledged and accepted the terms and conditions applicable to the recipients thereof (including any such terms and conditions set forth, or otherwise maintained, on the Platform with respect thereto).  Each Lender and Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender or any of their respective Affiliates and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Section 9.08. Name Agent.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, the parties hereto acknowledge that the Lead Arrangers are named as such for recognition purposes only, and in their capacities as such shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; it being understood and agreed that the Lead Arrangers shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Agents provided herein and in the other Loan Documents.

The agreements in this Section 9.09 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Section 9.10. Withholding Taxes.  To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, or if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement without deduction of applicable withholding tax from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred. Section 9.11. Lenders&#8217; Representations, Warranties and Acknowledgements. (a) Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Holdings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Credit Extensions hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Holdings, the Borrower and its respective Subsidiaries.  No Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to the Lenders.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank acknowledges that no Agent or Related Person of any Agent has made any representation or warranty to it.  Except for documents expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by an Agent to the Lenders or Issuing Banks, no Agent shall have any duty or responsibility (either express or implied) to provide any Lender or Issuing Bank with any credit or other information concerning any Loan Party, including the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness  of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party, that may come in to the possession of an Agent or any of its Related Persons. (b) Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement or an Assignment and Acceptance and funding its Loan, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and 172 approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be approved by any Agent, the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, on the Closing Date. Section 9.12. Collateral Documents and Guaranty. (a) Agents under Collateral Documents and Guaranty.  Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, on behalf of and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, to be the agent for and representative of the Secured Parties with respect to the Guaranty, the Collateral and the Loan Documents; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall owe any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of care, duty of disclosure or any other obligation whatsoever to any holder of Obligations with respect to any Secured Hedge Agreement. Subject to Section 10.08, without further written consent or authorization from any Secured Party, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, may execute any documents or instruments necessary to (i) in connection with a sale or disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement, release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of such sale or other disposition of assets or to which the Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 10.08) have otherwise consented or (ii) release any Guarantor from the Guaranty pursuant to Section 11.10 or with respect to which the Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 10.08) have otherwise consented. (b) Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guaranty.  Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, Holdings, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under any of the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, for the benefit of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure or similar enforcement action by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 363(k), Section 1129(b)(2)(a)(ii) or otherwise of the Bankruptcy Code), the Collateral Agent (or any Lender, except with respect to a &#8220;credit bid&#8221; pursuant to Section 363(k), Section 1129(b)(2)(a)(ii) or otherwise of the Bankruptcy Code,) may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities) shall be entitled, upon instructions from the Required Lenders, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale or disposition, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other disposition. Section 9.13. Release of Collateral and Guarantees, Termination of Loan Documents. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender, or any affiliate of any Lender that is a party to any Secured Hedge Agreement) shall (in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) immediately below) automatically release any Lien on and shall take such actions as shall be required to (i) release its security interest in any Collateral subject to any Disposition permitted hereunder or under any other  Loan Document to any Person other than a Person required to grant a Lien to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents (or, if such transferee is a Person required to grant a Lien to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent on 173 such asset, at the option of the applicable Loan Party, such Lien on such asset may still be released in connection with the transfer so long as (x) the transferee grants a new Lien to the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent on such asset substantially concurrently with the transfer of such asset, (y) the transfer is between parties organized under the laws of different jurisdictions and at least one of such parties is a Foreign Subsidiary and (z) the priority of the new Lien is the same as that of the original Lien), and to release any guarantee obligations under any Loan Document of any Person subject to such Disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such Disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents, (ii) subject to Section 10.08, release its security interest in any Collateral if the release of the Lien related to such Collateral is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, (iii) release its security interest in any Collateral if such Collateral is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to Section 11.10, (iv) release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 7.01(u) or 7.01(w) (in the case of Section 7.01(w), to the extent required by the terms of the obligations secured by such Liens) or (v) release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty as provided in Section 11.10. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when all Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements not yet due and payable, (y) obligations in respect of Secured Cash Management Services Obligations and (z) contingent obligations not yet accrued or payable) have been paid in full and all Commitments and Letters of Credit (unless the obligations thereunder have been Cash Collateralized or as to which other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank have been made) have terminated or expired, upon request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender, or any affiliate of any Lender that is a party to any Secured Hedge Agreement or provides Secured Cash Management Services Obligations) take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all Collateral, and to release all guarantee obligations provided for in any Loan Document, whether or not on the date of such release there may be outstanding Obligations in respect of Secured Hedge Agreements or Secured Cash Management Services Obligations.  Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such guarantee obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. (c) The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agent&#8217;s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Collateral Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. (d) Administrative Agent May File Bankruptcy Disclosure and Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 174 (i) to file a verified statement pursuant to rule 2019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure that, in its sole opinion, complies with such rule&#8217;s disclosure requirements for entities representing more than one creditor; (ii) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03 and 10.05) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and (iii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under this Agreement out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Lenders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. Section 9.14.Erroneous Payments. (a) If the Administrative Agent notifies a Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Party, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Party (any such Lender, Issuing Bank, Secured Party or other recipient, a &#8220;Payment Recipient&#8221;) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender, Issuing Bank, Secured Party or other Payment Recipient on its behalf)  (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an &#8220;Erroneous Payment&#8221;) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Party shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the 175 </FONT></DIV>

(d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender or Issuing Bank that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an &#8220;Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency&#8221;), upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s notice to such Lender or Issuing Lender at any time, (i) such Lender or Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) of the relevant Class with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the &#8220;Erroneous Payment Impacted Class&#8221;) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the &#8220;Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment&#8221;) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement 176 incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants) with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender or Issuing Bank shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Bank shall cease to be a Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Bank and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.  The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender or Issuing Bank (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf).  For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender or Issuing Bank and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other Loan Party for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.

Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to Section 10.04(e), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and (B) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 10.05.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to 182 ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Lenders.

No assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 10.04(e). (f) Each Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other Persons in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participating banks or other Persons shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if they were Lenders (but with respect to any particular participant, to no greater extent than the Lender that sold the participation to such participant and only if such participant has complied with the requirements of such provisions as if it were a Lender) and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of the Borrower relating to the Loans and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (provided that the agreement or instrument pursuant to which such Lender has sold a participation may provide that such Lender shall not agree to the following amendments without the consent of such participating bank or Person hereunder:  amendments, modifications or waivers decreasing any fees payable to such participating bank or Person hereunder or the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on the Loans in which such participating bank or Person has an interest, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of fees, amortization, or interest on the Loans in which such participating bank or Person has an interest, increasing or extending the Commitments in which such participating bank or Person has an interest, releasing all or substantially all of the Guarantors (other than in connection with the sale of any such Guarantor in a transaction permitted by Section 7.05) or releasing all or substantially all of the Collateral) or changes in voting thresholds).  To the extent permitted by law, each participating bank or other Person also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.06 as though it were a Lender, provided such participating bank or other Person agrees to be subject to Section 2.15 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 5f.103-1(c), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and interest thereon) and terms of each participant&#8217;s interest in the Loans or other Obligations under this Agreement (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

(h) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure extensions of credit to such Lender or in support of obligations owed by such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an &#8220;SPV&#8221;), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes remain the Lender hereunder; provided, further, that nothing herein shall make the SPV a &#8220;Lender&#8221; for the purposes of this Agreement, obligate the Borrower or any other Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to deal with such SPV directly, obligate the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any manner to any greater extent than they were obligated to the Granting Lender, or increase costs or expenses of the Borrower.  The making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.04, any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV. (j) The Borrower shall not (except as expressly permitted by Section 7.04) assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks and each Lender, and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void. (k) Any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Term Loans to any Affiliated Lender on a non-pro rata basis through (x) Dutch Auctions open to all Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Auction Procedures or (y) open market purchases, subject to the following limitations: 185 (i) in connection with each assignment pursuant to this Section 10.04(k), none of Holdings, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or an Affiliated Lender purchasing any Lender&#8217;s Term Loans shall be required to make a representation that it is not in possession of material non-public information with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or their respective securities, and all parties to such transaction may render customary &#8220;big boy&#8221; letters to each other (or to the auction agent, if applicable); (ii) [reserved]; (iii) each Affiliated Lender will acknowledge and agree that the Term Loans owned by it shall be non-voting under Sections 1126 and 1129 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event that any proceeding thereunder shall be instituted by or against the Borrower or any other Loan Party or, alternatively, to the extent that the foregoing non-voting designation is deemed unenforceable for any reason, each Affiliated Lender shall vote its interest as a Lender in such proceedings in the same proportion as the allocation of voting with respect to such matter by those Lenders who are not Affiliated Lenders  (in each case under this clause (iii), except with respect to any matter that affects the Affiliated Lender (in its capacity as a Lender) in a manner that is disproportionate in any material respect to the effect on any Lender in the same Class); (iv) Affiliated Lenders will not be entitled to receive, and will not receive, information provided solely to Lenders by the Administrative Agent or any Lender and will not be permitted to attend or participate in, and will not attend or participate in, meetings attended solely by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, other than the right to receive notices of Borrowings, notices of prepayments and other administrative notices in respect of its Loans or Commitments required to be delivered to Lenders pursuant to Article 2; and (v) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans held at any one time by Affiliated Lenders may not exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans (including any Incremental Term Loans and Other Term Loans) outstanding at such time under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations of the preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to assignments to Specified Debt Funds.  As a condition to the effectiveness of each assignment of Term Loans to an Affiliated Lender, such Affiliated Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an assignment agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and shall provide written notice to the Administrative Agent confirming compliance with the requirements of this Section 10.04(k) and specifying the aggregate amount of Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders after giving effect to such assignment. Following the acquisition of any Term Loan by an Affiliated Lender, the Sponsor or any of its Related Parties may contribute such Term Loan to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of cancelling such Term Loan, which may include contribution (with the consent of the Borrower) to the Borrower (whether through any of its direct or indirect parent entities or otherwise) in exchange for debt or equity securities of such parent entity or the Borrower that are otherwise permitted by the Loan Documents to be issued by the Borrower or such parent entity at such time.  Any Term Loan contributed to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries shall be automatically and permanently cancelled immediately upon receipt by Holdings or such Subsidiary.

(m) So long as no Event of Default has occurred or is continuing or would result therefrom, any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Term Loans to Holdings or the Borrower on a non-pro rata basis solely through Dutch Auctions open to all Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Auction Procedures, subject to the following limitations and other provisions: (i) Holdings and the Borrower shall represent and warrant as of the date of any such purchase and assignment that neither Holdings nor the Borrower nor any of their respective directors or officers has any material non-public information with respect to Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or securities that has not been disclosed to the assigning Lender (other than because such assigning Lender does not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to Holdings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or securities) prior to such date to the extent such information could reasonably be expected to have a material effect upon, or otherwise be material, to a Term Lender&#8217;s decision to assign Term Loans to Holdings or the Borrower as applicable or shall have delivered a written statement to the assigning Lender that such representation cannot be made; (ii) Holdings and the Borrower will not be entitled to receive, and will not receive, information provided solely to Lenders by the Administrative Agent or any Lender and will not be permitted to attend or participate in, and will not attend or participate in, meetings or conference calls attended solely by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent; (iii) no proceeds from any Revolving Loan shall be used to fund such assignment; (iv) any Term Loans purchased by Holdings or the Borrower shall be automatically and permanently cancelled immediately upon acquisition by Holdings or the Borrower; 187 </FONT></DIV>

No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement.  In the case of a claim, investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 10.05 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, any Subsidiary of any Loan Party, any Loan Party&#8217;s directors, stockholders or creditors or other Affiliates or an Indemnitee or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents are consummated.  For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall not apply with respect to Taxes that are the subject of, or excluded from, Section 3.01 or Section 3.04.  &#8220;Related Indemnified Person&#8221; of an Indemnitee means (1) any Controlling Person or Controlled Affiliate of such Indemnitee, (2) the respective directors, officers, or employees of such Indemnitee or any of its Controlling Persons or Controlled Affiliates and (3) the respective agents or representatives of such Indemnitee or any of its Controlling Persons or Controlled Affiliates, in the case of this clause (3), acting on behalf of or at the instructions of such Indemnitee, Controlling Person or such Controlled Affiliate; provided that each reference to a Controlled Affiliate in this sentence pertains to a Controlled Affiliate involved in the negotiation or syndication of this Agreement and the applicable Class of Loans or Commitments.  For the avoidance of doubt, payments under this Section 10.05(b) shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the relevant Indemnitee. (c) To the extent that any Loan Party fails to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks or any Related Party of the foregoing under Section 10.05(a) or (b), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender&#8217;s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank in connection with such capacity.  For purposes hereof, a Lender&#8217;s &#8220;pro rata share&#8221; shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments at the time. 189 (d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) no Loan Party shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee and (ii) no Indemnitee shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Loan Party, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof (whether before or after the Closing Date); provided, that this sentence shall not limit the indemnification obligations of any Loan Party to the extent such special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages are included in any claim by a third party with respect to which the applicable Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification in accordance with Section 10.05. (e) The provisions of this Section 10.05 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be payable within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor. Section 10.06.  Right of Setoff.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender, Issuing Bank and each of their respective Affiliates (and the Collateral Agent, in respect of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses payable hereunder) is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to any Loan Party, any such notice being waived by each Loan Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender, Issuing Bank or any such Affiliate or the Collateral Agent to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any and all Obligations (other than, with respect to any Guarantor, Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor) owing to such Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate or the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Collateral Agent or such Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness.  The Collateral Agent and each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Lender and Issuing Bank under this Section 10.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such Lender and Issuing Banks may have at Law. Section 10.07.  Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD APPLY THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. 190 Section 10.08.  Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender or Issuing Bank in exercising any power or right hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders and Issuing Banks hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 10.08(b) or (c) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand on the Borrower or Holdings in any case shall entitle the Borrower or Holdings to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, Holdings and the Required Lenders (except as provided to the contrary under Section 2.19, Section 2.20 or Section 2.21, clause (b)(i), clause (b)(ii), clause (b)(iv), clause (b)(viii) or clause (b)(ix) below, clause (b)(w) or clause (b)(z) below, or clause (c), clause (d) or clause (e) below, which, in each case, shall only require the consent of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, as expressly set forth therein and not Required Lenders) (provided that amendments to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall require the agreement of the Loan Parties (or any of them) only to the extent required pursuant to the terms thereof); provided, however, that no such agreement shall: (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the maturity of or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of any fee or any interest on any Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof (other than with respect to any default interest), or decrease the amount of any fee or the rate of interest on any Loan (other than with respect to any default interest), without the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby (it being understood that (x) the waiver of (or amendment to the terms of) any mandatory prepayment of the Loans shall not constitute a postponement of any date scheduled for the payment of principal or interest and (y) any change to the definition of &#8220;First Lien Leverage Ratio&#8221;, &#8220;Senior Secured Leverage Ratio&#8221; or &#8220;Total Leverage Ratio&#8221; or in the component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction or forgiveness in any rate of interest), (ii) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent or of any Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of any Lender), (iii) amend or modify the pro rata requirements of Section 2.13(c) or Section 2.14, the provisions of Section 10.04(j) or the provisions of this Section 10.08 or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors (other than in connection with the sale of such Guarantors in a transaction permitted by Section 7.04 or 7.05) or all or substantially all of the Collateral, without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (iv) (A) amend, waive or otherwise modify any term or provision of any Loan Document which directly affects Lenders under any Class of Revolving Commitments, 191 </FONT></DIV>

For the avoidance of doubt, the Lenders and each Affiliated Lender (other than any Specified Debt Fund) agree and acknowledge that the provisions set forth in this Section 10.08(f), and the related provisions set forth in each assignment agreement relating to an assignment to such Affiliated Lender, constitute a &#8220;subordination agreement&#8221; as such term is contemplated by, and utilized in, Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and, as such, would be enforceable for all purposes in any case where a Loan Party has filed for protection under any Debtor Relief Law applicable to the Loan Party.

Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the Fee Letter and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof.  Any other previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof are superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto and thereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent expressly provided in Section 10.04(f) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Section 10.11.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.11. Section 10.12.  Severability.  In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction).  The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. Section 10.13.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 10.03. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Section 10.14.  Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. Section 10.15.  Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties 195 </FONT></DIV>

The Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that if the Borrower or other Guarantor(s) shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantors will promptly pay the same in cash, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. Section 11.02.  Obligations Unconditional.  The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 11.01 shall constitute a guaranty of payment and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower or any other Guarantor under this Agreement, any Notes issued under this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or Guarantor (except for payment in full). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder which shall remain absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances as described above: (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Guarantors, to the extent permitted by Law, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted; (c) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be amended in any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be amended or waived in any respect or 200 any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; (d) any Lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, any Secured Party or Agent as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected; or (e) the release of any other Guarantor pursuant to Section 11.10. Section 11.03.  Certain Waivers, Etc..  The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and, to the extent permitted by Law, all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that any Secured Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against the Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes issued hereunder, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Guarantors waive, to the extent permitted by Law, any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured Party upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Guarantee, and all dealings between the Borrower and the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee.  This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time or from time to time held by Secured Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other person at any time of any right or remedy against the Borrower or against any other person which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto.  This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantors and the successors and permitted assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Secured Parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding.  Each Guarantor waives any rights and defenses that are or may become available to it by reason of &sect;&sect; 2787 to 2855, inclusive, and &sect;&sect; 2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code.  As provided in Section 10.07, the provisions of this Article 11 shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Section 11.04.  Reinstatement.  The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article 11 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or other Loan Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. Section 11.05.  Subrogation; Subordination.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that until the payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of the Lenders and the expiry or termination of all Letters of Credit (unless the obligations thereunder have been Cash Collateralized or as to which other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank have been made) under this Agreement it shall waive any claim and shall not exercise any right or remedy, direct or indirect, arising by reason of any performance 201 by it of its guarantee in Section 11.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against the Borrower or any other Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Any Indebtedness of any Loan Party to any Person that is not a Loan Party permitted pursuant to Section 7.03(b) or 7.03(d) shall be subordinated to such Loan Party&#8217;s Obligations in the manner set forth in the Intercompany Note evidencing such Indebtedness. Section 11.06.  Remedies.  The Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes issued hereunder, if any, may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 8.02 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Section 8.02) for purposes of Section 11.01, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 11.01. Section 11.07.  Instrument for the Payment of Money.  Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article 11 constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Secured Party or Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213. Section 11.08.  Continuing Guarantee.  The guarantee in this Article 11 is a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. Section 11.09.  General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations.  In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 11.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 11.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 11.11) that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding. Section 11.10.  Release of Guarantors.  If, in compliance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, (i) all or substantially all of the Equity Interests or property of any Subsidiary Guarantor are sold or otherwise transferred to a Person or Persons none of which is a Loan Party or (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor either becomes an Excluded Subsidiary or ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (any such Subsidiary Guarantor, and any Subsidiary Guarantor referred to in clause (i), a &#8220;Transferred Guarantor&#8221;), such Transferred Guarantor shall, upon the consummation of such sale or transfer or other transaction, be automatically released from its obligations under this Agreement (including under Section 10.05 hereof) and its obligations to pledge and grant any Collateral owned by it pursuant to any Collateral Document and, in the case of a sale of all or substantially all of the Equity Interests of the Transferred Guarantor, the pledge of such Equity Interests to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Documents shall be automatically released, and, so long as the Borrower shall have provided the Agents such certifications or documents as any Agent shall reasonably request, the Collateral Agent shall take such actions as are necessary to effect each release described in this Section 11.10 in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Collateral Documents; provided that no Guarantor shall be released as provided in this paragraph if such Guarantor continues to be a guarantor in respect of any 202 Incremental Equivalent Debt, any Permitted First Priority Refinancing Debt, any Permitted Second Priority Refinancing Debt, any Permitted Unsecured Refinancing Debt, any Junior Financing, the 2021 Unsecured Notes, the 2025 Unsecured Notes, the 2027 Unsecured Notes or any Permitted Refinancing of any of the foregoing. When all Commitments hereunder have terminated, and all Loans or other Obligations hereunder which are accrued and payable have been paid or satisfied, and no Letter of Credit remains outstanding (unless the obligations thereunder have been Cash Collateralized or as to which other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank have been made), this Agreement and the Guarantees made herein shall terminate with respect to all Obligations, except with respect to Obligations that expressly survive such repayment pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Section 11.11.  Right of Contribution.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Subsidiary Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor&#8217;s right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 11.05.  The provisions of this Section 11.11 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties, and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. Section 11.12.  Additional Guarantor Waivers and Agreements. (a) Each Guarantor understands and acknowledges that if the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party forecloses judicially or nonjudicially against any real property security for the Obligations, that foreclosure could impair or destroy any ability that such Guarantor may have to seek reimbursement, contribution, or indemnification from the Borrower or others based on any right such Guarantor may have of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnification for any amounts paid by such Guarantor under the Guaranty.  Each Guarantor further understands and acknowledges that in the absence of this Section 11.12, such potential impairment or destruction of such Guarantor&#8217;s rights, if any, may entitle such Guarantor to assert a defense to this Guaranty based on Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure as interpreted in Union Bank v. Gradsky, 265 Cal. App. 2d 40 (1968).  By executing this Guaranty, each Guarantor freely, irrevocably, and unconditionally:  (i) waives and relinquishes that defense and agrees that such Guarantor will be fully liable under this Guaranty even though the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may foreclose, either by judicial foreclosure or by exercise of power of sale, any deed of trust securing the Obligations; (ii) agrees that such Guarantor will not assert that defense in any action or proceeding which the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may commence to enforce this Guaranty; (iii) acknowledges and agrees that the rights and defenses waived by such Guarantor in this Guaranty include any right or defense that such Guarantor may have or be entitled to assert based upon or arising out of any one or more of &sect;&sect; 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or &sect; 2848 of the California Civil Code; and (iv) acknowledges and agrees that the Secured Parties are relying on this waiver in creating the Obligations, and that this waiver is a material part of the consideration which the Secured Parties are receiving for creating the Obligations. (b) Each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that such Guarantor may have because any of the Obligations is secured by real property.  This means, among other things:  (i) the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties may collect from such Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the other Loan Parties; and (ii) if the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by the 203 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">other Loan Parties: (A) the amount of the Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (B) the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties may collect from such Guarantor even if the Secured Parties, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, have destroyed any right such Guarantor may have to collect from the Borrower.  This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses such Guarantor may have because any of the Obligations is secured by real property.  These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon &sect; 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. (c) Each Guarantor waives any right or defense it may have at law or equity, including California Code of Civil Procedure &sect; 580a, to a fair market value hearing or action to determine a deficiency judgment after a foreclosure.
