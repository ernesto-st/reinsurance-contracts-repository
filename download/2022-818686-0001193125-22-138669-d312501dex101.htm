Percentage of such LC&nbsp;Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above, each of such Lender and such Borrower severally agrees to pay interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date such amount is required

Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures. Each of the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, and each Lender (collectively, each a
&#147;<B><U>Credit Party</U></B>&#148;) agrees that any Electronic Signature on or associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on such Person to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered
into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person enforceable against such Person in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered.
Any communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under
this paragraph may include, without limitation, use or acceptance of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed Communication converted into
another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Administrative Agent and each of the Credit Parties may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record
(&#147;<B><U>Electronic Copy</U></B>&#148;), which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of such Person&#146;s business, and destroy the original paper document. All Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an
Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Administrative Agent, the
Sustainability Coordinator, Issuing Bank nor Swingline Lender is under any obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by such Person pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further,
without limiting the foregoing, (a)&nbsp;to the extent the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator, Issuing Bank and/or Swingline Lender has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Credit
Parties shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Parties and/or any Credit Party without further verification and regardless of the appearance or form of such Electronic Signature, and
(b)&nbsp;upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Credit Party, any Communication executed using an Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed counterpart. </P>

Agent&#146;s, Issuing Bank&#146;s or Swingline Lender&#146;s reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted by telecopy, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means). The Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Coordinator, Issuing Bank and
Swingline Lender shall be entitled to rely on, and shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon, any Communication or any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to
