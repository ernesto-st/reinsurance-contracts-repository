                           ARTICLE 2 - GENERAL TERMS

      Section 2.1 Loan Commitment; Disbursement to Borrower

      (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Lender
hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby agrees to accept the Loan on the
Closing Date.

      (b) Borrower may request and receive only one borrowing in respect of the
Loan and any amount borrowed and repaid in respect of the Loan may not be
reborrowed.

      (c) The Loan shall be evidenced by the Note and secured by the Mortgages
and the other Loan Documents.

      (d) Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan to (i) pay certain costs
in connection with the acquisition and financing of the Properties, (ii) make
deposits into the Reserve Funds on the Closing Date in the amounts provided
herein, (iii) pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of
the Loan, as approved by Lender, (iv) fund any working capital requirements of
the Properties, and (v) distribute the balance, if any, to its partners, members
or shareholders, as applicable.

      Section 2.2 Loan Payments

      (a) The Loan shall bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to the
Note Rate. Interest shall be computed based on the daily rate produced assuming
a three

                                       20

<PAGE>

hundred sixty (360) day year, multiplied by the actual number of days elapsed.
Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, interest shall be paid in
arrears.

      (b) Borrower hereby agrees to pay sums due under the Note as follows: An
initial payment of $65,564.84 is due on the Closing Date for interest from the
Closing Date through and including April 30, 2004. Thereafter, except as may be
adjusted in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.2(c), consecutive
monthly installments of principal and interest in an amount equal to
$1,229,803.60 shall be payable pursuant to the terms of Section 2.2(d) (the
"MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT") on the first (1st) day of each month beginning on June
1, 2004 (each a "SCHEDULED PAYMENT DATE") until the entire indebtedness
evidenced hereby is fully paid, except that any remaining indebtedness, if not
sooner paid, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

      (c) The Monthly Payment Amount shall mean the amount of interest and
principal which would be due in order to fully amortize the principal amount of
the Loan, over an amortization term of twenty-five (25) years assuming an annual
interest rate equal to the Note Rate, computed on the basis of a three hundred
sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days each.
Borrower expressly understands and agrees that such computation of interest
based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months
of thirty (30) days each is solely for the purpose of determining the Monthly
Payment Amount, and, notwithstanding such computation, interest shall accrue on
the outstanding principal amount of the Loan as provided in Section 2.2(a)
above. Borrower understands and acknowledges that such interest accrual
requirement results in more interest accruing on the Loan than if either a
thirty (30) day month and a three hundred sixty (360) day year or the actual
number of days and a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year were used to
compute the accrual of interest on the Loan. Borrower recognizes that such
interest accrual requirement will not fully amortize the Loan within the
amortization period set forth above. Following any partial prepayment occurring
solely as a result of the application of Insurance Proceeds or Awards pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
adjust the Monthly Payment Amount to give effect to any such partial prepayment,
provided, however, that in no event will any such adjustment result in any such
installment becoming due and payable on any date after the Maturity Date.

      (d) Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be payable
at P.O. Box 515228, Los Angeles, California 90051-6528, Attn: Commercial
Mortgage Loan Servicing #1777, or at such other place as the Lender may
designate from time to time in writing, on the date such payment is due, to
Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may designate by written notice to
Borrower. Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Note shall be stated to be
due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
first Business Day preceding such scheduled due date.

      (e) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, all monthly payments
made as scheduled under this Agreement and the Note shall be applied first to
the payment of interest computed at the Note Rate, and the balance toward the
reduction of the principal amount of the Note. All voluntary and involuntary
prepayments on the Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to accrued but
unpaid interest on the amount prepaid, to the

                                       21

<PAGE>

remaining principal amount, and any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in
connection with the Loan, in such manner and order as Lender may elect in its
sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, application to
principal installments in inverse order of maturity. Following the occurrence of
an Event of Default, any payment made on the Note shall be applied to accrued
but unpaid interest, late charges, accrued fees, the unpaid principal amount of
the Note, and any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the
Loan, in such manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute
discretion.

      (f) All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the Note or the other
Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any deduction for, any
setoff, defense or counterclaims.

      Section 2.3 Late Payment Charge

      If any principal or interest payment is not paid by Borrower on or before
the date after the same is due, Borrower shall pay to lender upon demand an
amount equal to the lesser of four percent (4%) of such unpaid sum or the
maximum amount permitted by applicable law in order to defray the expense
incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent payment and to
compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent payment. Any such
amount shall be secured by the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

      Section 2.4 Prepayment; Defeasance

      Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 2.4 no voluntary
prepayments, whether in whole or in part, of the Loan or any other amount at any
time due and owing under the Note can be made by Borrower or any other Person
without the express written consent of Lender.

      (a) Lockout Period. Borrower has no right to make, and Lender shall have
no obligation to accept, any voluntary prepayment, whether in whole or in part,
of the Loan during the Lockout Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either
(i) Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, accepts a full or partial
voluntary prepayment during the Lockout Period or (ii) there is an involuntary
prepayment during the Lockout Period, then, in either case, Borrower shall, in
addition to any portion of the Loan prepaid (together with all interest accrued
and unpaid thereon), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in an amount calculated
in accordance with Section 2.4(e) hereof.

      (b) Defeasance.

            (i) Notwithstanding, any other provision of this Section 2.4 to the
      contrary, including, without limitation, subsection (a) of this Section
      2.4, at any time other than during a REMIC Prohibition Period, Borrower
      may (1) voluntarily defease in whole the Note and obtain releases from the
      Liens of the Mortgages of all of the Properties or (2) partially defease
      the Note and obtain a release from the Lien of the Mortgage of one or more
      Individual Property, but less than all of the Properties, in each case
      together with all improvements thereon and other

                                       22

<PAGE>

      property appurtenant thereto which is collateral for the Loan evidenced
      hereby (each Individual Property being released from the Lien of the
      Mortgage is referred to as a "DEFEASED PROPERTY", and the Individual
      Properties remaining subject to the Lien of the Mortgages are referred to
      collectively as the "REMAINING PROPERTY"), upon the satisfaction of the
      following conditions (a "DEFEASANCE EVENT"):

                  (A) Borrower shall give Lender not less than sixty (60) (but
            not more than ninety (90)) days prior written notice, specifying (i)

            such notice by providing Lender with notice of cancellation ten (10)
            days prior to the scheduled Defeasance Date, or (2) to extend the
            scheduled Defeasance Date until the next Scheduled Payment Date;
            provided that in each case, Borrower shall pay all of Lender's costs
            and expenses incurred as a result of such cancellation or extension,

            this Agreement, the Note and under the other Loan Documents up to
            the Defeasance Date, including, without limitation, all reasonable
            costs and expenses incurred by Lender or its agents in connection
            with such partial release (including, without limitation, any legal
            fees and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining and
            reviewing the Defeasance Collateral and the preparation of the
            Defeased Note, the Undefeased Note, the Defeasance Security
            Agreement and related documentation), shall be paid in full on or
            prior to the Defeasance Date;

                  (C) No Event of Default shall exist under any of the Loan
            Documents;

                  (D) In the event only a portion of the Note is the subject of
            a Defeasance Event, Lender, at Borrower's expense, shall prepare all
            necessary documents to sever the indebtedness evidenced by the Note
            into two substitute notes, one (the "DEFEASED NOTE") having a
            principal balance equal to the defeased portion of the original
            Note, and the other (the "UNDEFEASED NOTE") having a principal
            balance equal to the undefeased portion of the original Note as of
            the Defeasance Date. The Defeased Note and the Undefeased Note shall
            have identical terms as the original Note, except for the principal
            balance, and the Defeased Note or Defeased Notes and the Undefeased
            Note or Undefeased Notes shall be crossed-defaulted with each other.
            A Defeased Note cannot be the subject of any further Defeasance. An
            Undefeased Note may be the subject of a further Defeasance in
            accordance with the terms of this Section;

                        (1) a pledge and security agreement, in form and
                        substance which would be satisfactory to a prudent
                        lender, creating a first priority security interest in
                        favor of Lender in the Defeasance Collateral (the
                        "DEFEASANCE SECURITY AGREEMENT"), which shall provide,
                        among other things, that any excess received by Lender
                        from the Defeasance Collateral over the amounts payable
                        under the Note or the Defeased Note, as applicable,
                        which excess amounts are not required to cover all or
                        any portion of amounts payable on a Scheduled Payment
                        Date, shall be refunded to Borrower promptly after each
                        such Scheduled Payment Date;

                        (2) direct non-callable obligations of the United States
                        of America or other obligations which are "government
                        securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
                        the Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent the
                        applicable Rating Agencies rating the Securities have
                        confirmed in writing will not cause a downgrade,
                        withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if
                        higher, then applicable ratings of the Securities (the
                        "DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL"), which provide payments on or
                        prior to, but as close as possible to, all successive
                        scheduled payment dates after the Defeasance Date upon
                        which interest and principal payments are required under
                        the Note, in the case of a Defeasance Event for the
                        entire outstanding principal balance of the Note, or the
                        Defeased Note, in the case of a Defeasance Event for
                        only a portion of the outstanding principal balance of
                        the Note, as applicable and in amounts equal to the
                        scheduled payments due on such dates under the Note or
                        the Defeased Note, as applicable (including without
                        limitation scheduled payments of principal, interest and
                        the charges of the Rating Agencies) and assuming such
                        the Note or the Defeased Note, as applicable, is paid in
                        full on the Maturity Date, each of which shall be duly
                        endorsed by the holder thereof as directed by Lender or
                        accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form

                        required by the depository institution holding such
                        securities or the issuer thereof, as the case may be, to
                        effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the
                        book-entry facilities of such institution) in order to

                        requirements set forth in this Section have been
                        satisfied in all material respects;

                        (4) one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower in form
                        and substance and delivered by counsel which would be
                        satisfactory to a prudent lender stating, among other
                        things, that (i) Lender has a perfected first priority
                        security interest in the Defeasance Collateral and that
                        the Defeasance Security Agreement is enforceable against
                        Borrower in accordance with its terms, (ii) in the event
                        of a bankruptcy proceeding or similar occurrence with
                        respect to Borrower, none of the Defeasance Collateral
                        nor any proceeds thereof will be property of Borrower's
                        estate under Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code or any
                        similar statute and the grant of security interest
                        therein to Lender shall not constitute an avoidable
                        preference under Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code or
                        applicable state law, (iii) the release of the Lien of
                        the Mortgage and the pledge of Defeasance Collateral
                        will not directly or indirectly result in or cause any
                        REMIC Trust that then holds the Note to fail to maintain
                        its status as a REMIC Trust and (iv) the defeasance will
                        not cause any REMIC Trust to be an "investment company"
                        under the Investment Company Act of 1940;

                        (5) Lender has received written confirmation from any
                        Rating Agency rating any Securities that such
                        substitution of the Defeasance Collateral will not
                        result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of
                        the ratings then assigned to any of the Securities;

                        (6) a certificate in form and scope acceptable to Lender
                        in its sole discretion from an Acceptable Accountant
                        certifying that the Defeasance Collateral will
                        generate amounts sufficient to make all payments of
                        principal and interest due under the Note or the
                        Defeased Note, as applicable (including the scheduled
                        outstanding principal balance of the Note or the
                        Defeased Note, as applicable, due on the Maturity Date);

<PAGE>

                        (7) in the event only a portion of the Note is the
                        subject of a Defeasancs Event, evidence reasonably
                        acceptable to Lender that the Undefeased Note will
                        continue to be secured by the Mortgages; and

                        (8) such other certificates, opinions, documents or
                        instruments as Lender may reasonably require.

            (ii) Upon a defeasance in accordance with Section, Borrower shall,
      at Lender's sole and absolute discretion, assign all its obligations and
      rights under the Defeased Note to a special-purpose bankruptcy-remote
      entity ("SUCCESSOR BORROWER") to be formed by Borrower at its sole cost
      and expense. In connection therewith, the Successor Borrower shall execute
      an assumption agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in
      its sole discretion pursuant to which it shall assume Borrower's
      obligations under the Note or the Defeased Note, as applicable, and the
      Defeasance Security Agreement. The sole asset of Successor Borrower shall
      be the Defeasance Collateral. In connection with such assignment and
      assumption, Borrower and/or Successor Borrower shall:

                  (A) deliver to Lender an opinion of counsel in form and
            substance (but subject to customary qualifications and limitations)
            and delivered by counsel satisfactory to Lender in its sole
            discretion stating, among other things, that such assumption
            agreement is enforceable against Borrower and Successor Borrower, as
            applicable, in accordance with its terms and that the Note or the
            Defeased Note, as applicable, and the Defeasance Security Agreement
            and any other documents executed in connection with such defeasance
            are enforceable against Successor Borrower, and, in the event only a
            portion of the Note is the subject of a Defeasance Event, the
            Undefeased Note remains enforceable against Borrower, each in
            accordance with their respective terms, and

                  (B) pay all costs and expenses incurred by Lender or its
            agents in connection with such assignment and assumption (including,
            without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and
            disbursements).

Upon an assumption by Successor Borrower acceptable to Lender, (i) Borrower
shall be relieved of its obligations under the Note or the Defeased Note, as
applicable, and the Defeasance Security Agreement and, to the extent such
documents relate to the Defeased Property, the other Loan Documents, and (ii) in
the event only a portion of the Note is the subject of a Defeasance Event, if
the Defeased Property is owned other than by the owner of the Remaining
Property, then the owner of the Defeased Property shall be relieved of its
obligations under the Undefeased Note and the other Loan Documents for matters
occurring following the partial defeasance.

      (c) Upon compliance with the requirements of this Section, (1) in the
event the entire Note is the subject of a Defeasance Event, the Properties shall
be released from the Liens of the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, and
the Defeasance Collateral

                                       26

<PAGE>

shall constitute collateral which shall secure the Note or (2) in the event only
a portion of the Note is the subject of a Defeasance Event the Defeased Property
shall be released from the Lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents,
and the Defeasance Collateral shall constitute collateral which shall secure the
Defeased Note. Lender will, at Borrower's expense, execute and deliver any
agreements reasonably requested by Borrower to release the Lien of the Mortgage
from the Defeased Property.

      (d) For purposes of this Section 2.4, "REMIC PROHIBITION PERIOD" mean the
latest to occur of (i) two (2) years from the "startup day" within the meaning
of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of the REMIC Trust with respect to a
Securitization of Note A-1 and (ii) two (2) years from the "startup day" within
the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of the REMIC Trust with respect to
a Securitization of Note A-2, (iii) two (2) years from the "startup day" within
the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of the REMIC Trust with respect to
a Securitization of Note B or (iv) four (4) years from the Closing Date. In no
event shall Lender have any obligation to notify Borrower that a REMIC
Prohibition Period is in effect with respect to the Loan, except that Lender
shall notify Borrower if any REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with respect
to the Loan after receiving any notice described in this Section 2.4; provided,
however, that the failure of Lender to so notify Borrower shall not impose any
liability on Lender or grant Borrower any right to defease the Loan during any
such REMIC Prohibition Period.

      (e) Involuntary Prepayment During the Lockout Period. During the Lockout
Period, in the event of any involuntary prepayment of the Loan or any other
amount under the Note, whether in whole or in part, in connection with or
following Lender's acceleration of the Note or otherwise, and whether the
Mortgage is satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of sale or
judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means,
including, without limitation, repayment of the Loan by Borrower or any other
Person pursuant to any statutory or common law right of redemption, Borrower
shall, in addition to any portion of the principal balance of the Loan prepaid
(together with all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and in the event the
prepayment is made on a date other than a Scheduled Payment Date, a sum equal to
the amount of interest which would have accrued under the Note on the amount of
such prepayment if such prepayment had occurred on the next Scheduled Payment
Date), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in an amount calculated in accordance
with this Section 2.4(e). Such prepayment premium shall be in an amount equal to
the greater of:

            (i) 1% of the portion of the Loan being prepaid; or

            (ii) the product obtained by multiplying:

                  (A) the portion of the Loan being prepaid, times;

                  (B) the difference obtained by subtracting (I) the Yield Rate
            from (II) the Note Rate, times;

                  (C) the present value factor calculated using the following
            formula:

                                       27

<PAGE>

                  1-(1+r)-n
                  ---------
                      r

                  r =           Yield Rate

                  n =           the number of years and any fraction thereof,
                                remaining between the date the prepayment is
                                made and the Maturity Date of the Note.

As used herein, "YIELD RATE" means the yield rate for the 4.00% U.S. Treasury
Security due February 15, 2014, as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the
fifth Business Day preceding the Prepayment Calculation Date. If the Yield Rate
is not published for such U.S. Treasury Security, then the "Yield Rate" shall
mean the yield rate for the nearest equivalent U.S. Treasury Security (as
selected at Lender's sole and absolute discretion) as reported in The Wall
Street Journal on the fifth Business Day preceding the Prepayment Calculation
Date. If the publication of such Yield Rate in The Wall Street Journal is
discontinued, Lender shall determine such Yield Rate from another source
selected by Lender in Lender's sole and absolute discretion. The "PREPAYMENT
CALCULATION DATE" shall mean, as applicable, the date on which (i) Lender
applies any partial prepayment to the reduction of the outstanding principal
amount the Note, in the case of a voluntary partial prepayment which is accepted
by Lender, (ii) Lender accelerates the Loan, in the case of a prepayment
resulting from acceleration, or (iii) Lender applies funds held under any
Reserve Account, in the case of a prepayment resulting from such an application
(other than in connection with acceleration of the Loan).

      (f) Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds; Excess Interest. Notwithstanding
any other provision herein to the contrary, and provided no Event of Default
exists, Borrower shall not be required to pay any prepayment premium and no
Defeasance Collateral shall be due in connection with any prepayment occurring
solely as a result of (i) the application of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation
Proceeds (including any Termination Amount paid in accordance with the Operating
Lease) pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents or (ii) the application of
any interest in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law to the
reduction of the Loan.

      (g) After the Lockout Period. Commencing on the day after the expiration
of the Lockout Period, and upon giving Lender at least sixty (60) days (but not
more than ninety (90) days) prior written notice, Borrower may voluntarily
prepay (without premium) the Note in whole (but not in part) on a Scheduled
Payment Date. Lender shall accept a prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.4(g)
on a day other than a Scheduled Payment Date provided that, in addition to
payment of the full outstanding principal balance of the Note, Borrower pays to
Lender a sum equal to the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
Note if such prepayment occurred on the next Scheduled Payment Date.

                                       28

<PAGE>

      (h) Limitation on Partial Prepayments. Subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.4(e) and (f) hereof, in no event shall Lender have any obligation to
accept a partial prepayment.

      Section 2.5 Payments after Default

      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan,
(a) shall accrue at the Default Rate, and (b) Lender shall be entitled to
receive and Borrower shall pay to Lender all cash flow from the Operating Lease
in accordance with the terms of the Cash Management Agreement, such amount to be
applied by Lender to the payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall
determine in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, alternating
applications thereof between interest and principal. Interest at the Default
Rate shall be computed from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the
earlier of (i) the actual receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion
thereof that is then due) and (ii) the cure of such Event of Default; provided,
however, after payment in full of the Debt, any excess proceeds received by
Lender shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Cash Management Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest
at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall itself accrue interest at
the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the Mortgages. This paragraph
shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the date of the
payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right or remedy accruing to
Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default; the acceptance of
any payment from Borrower shall not be deemed to cure or constitute a waiver of
any Event of Default; and Lender retains its rights under this Agreement to
accelerate and to continue to demand payment of the Debt upon the happening of
and during the continuance any Event of Default, despite any payment by Borrower
to Lender.

      Section 2.6 Usury Savings

      This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that at
no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the principal
balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either civil or
criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If,
by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any
time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due
hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Note Rate or the
Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to
the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal (without
prepayment premium or penalty) and not on account of the interest due hereunder.
All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance, or
detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the
full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of
interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of
interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as
the Loan is outstanding.

      Section 2.7 Release of Property.

      Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at any time
other than during a REMIC Prohibition Period, Borrower may obtain the release of
an Individual Property from the Lien of the Mortgage thereon (and related Loan
Documents) and the release of Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents
with respect to such Individual Property (other than those expressly stated to
survive), but only upon the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

      (a) Borrower shall provide Lender with at least twenty (20) days but no
more than ninety (90) days prior written notice of its request to obtain a
release of the Individual Property;

      (b) A wire transfer to Lender of immediately available federal funds (or
the delivery to Lender of Defeasance Collateral, if applicable) in an amount
equal to the Release Price for the applicable Individual Property, together with
(i) all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of principal being prepaid on
the date of such prepayment and (ii) all other sums due under this Agreement,
the Note or the other Loan Documents in connection with a partial prepayment to
be calculated and applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4(b)
hereof;

      (c) Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than twenty (20) days prior
to the date of such release, a release of Lien (and related Loan Documents) for
such Individual Property for execution by Lender. Such release shall be in a

Properties and (ii) the aggregate loan-to-value ratio with respect to the
Properties remaining subject to the Lien of the Mortgages immediately prior to
the release of the Individual Property;

      (g) Lender shall have received evidence reasonably acceptable to Lender

      Section 2.8 Substitution of Properties.

      Subject to the terms of this Section, Borrower shall have the right to
obtain a release of the Lien of a Mortgage (and the related Loan Documents)
encumbering one or more Individual Properties (each, a "RELEASE PROPERTY") by
substituting therefor one or more self-storage facilities of like kind and
quality acquired by Borrower or an Affiliate of Borrower (provided, however, if
the Substitute Property shall be owned by an Affiliate of Borrower said
Affiliate (i) shall assume all the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement,
the Note and the other Loan Documents and (ii) shall become a party to the Note
and the other Loan Documents and shall be bound by the terms and provisions
thereof as if it had executed the Note and the other Loan Documents and shall
have the rights and obligations of Borrower thereunder) (individually, a
"SUBSTITUTE PROPERTY" and collectively, the "SUBSTITUTE PROPERTIES"), provided
that the following conditions precedent are satisfied:

      (a) Borrower's right to release and substitute Properties in accordance
with this Section shall terminate from and after the time Borrower has
substituted fifteen (15) Properties, provided, however, in no event may
Properties which represent, in the aggregate, more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the original aggregate Basic Rent be released and substituted in
accordance with this Section 2.8.

      (b) Lender shall have received at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice requesting the substitution and identifying the Substitute Property and
Release Property.

                                       31

<PAGE>

      (c) If the applicable Borrower continues to own an Individual Property
subject to the Lien of a Mortgage, Lender shall have received (i) a copy of a
deed conveying all of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the Release
Property to a Person other than Borrower, Borrower Principal, or any Affiliate
of either of the foregoing pursuant to an arms length transaction and (ii) a
letter from Borrower countersigned by a title insurance company acknowledging
receipt of such deed and agreeing to record such deed in the real estate records
for the county in which the Release Property is located.

      (d) Lender shall have received a current Appraisal of the Substitute
Property prepared within one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the release and
substitution (i) showing an appraised value equal to or greater than the
appraised value of the Release Property as of the Closing Date, and (ii) which
supports an aggregate loan-to-value ratio with respect to the Properties
remaining subject to the Lien of the Mortgages after the substitution not
greater than the lesser of (A) the aggregate loan-to-value ratio as of the
Closing Date with respect to all of the Properties and (B) the aggregate
loan-to-value ratio with respect to the Properties remaining subject to the Lien
of the Mortgages immediately prior to the date of the proposed substitution.

      (e) Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower certifying,
together with other evidence that would be satisfactory to a prudent
institutional mortgage loan lender that, after the substitution of a Substitute
Property and the release of the Release Property, (i) the Operations Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately
preceding the date of the substitution with respect to all Properties remaining
subject to the Lien of the Mortgages after the substitution shall be equal to or
greater than (A) 1.60:1.00 and (B) the lesser of (y) the Operations Debt Service
Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding
the substitution (including the Release Property and excluding the Substitute
Property) and (z) 1.85:1.00 and (ii) the Operations Debt Service Coverage Ratio
for the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the substitution with respect
to the Substitute Property is equal to or greater than 1.60:1.00.

      (f) Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower certifying,
together with other evidence that would be satisfactory to a prudent
institutional mortgage loan lender that, after the substitution of a Substitute
Property and the release of the Release Property, (i) the Debt Service Coverage
Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the date of
the substitution with respect to all Properties remaining subject to the Lien of
the Mortgages after the substitution shall be equal to or greater than (A)
1.69:1.00 and (B) the lesser of (y) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the substitution
(including the Release Property and excluding the Substitute Property) and (z)
1.90:1.00 and (ii) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) months
immediately preceding the substitution with respect to the Substitute Property
is equal or greater than 1.69:1.00.

      (g) If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender shall have received
confirmation in writing from the Rating Agencies to the effect that such release
and substitution will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of
the respective ratings in effect immediately prior to such release and
substitution for the Securities

                                       32

<PAGE>

issued in connection with the Securitization that are then outstanding. If the
Loan is not part of a Securitization, Lender shall have consented in writing to
such release and substitution, which consent shall be given in Lender's
reasonable discretion applying the requirements of a prudent institutional
mortgage loan lender with respect to real estate collateral of similar size,
scope and value of the Substitute Property.

      (h) No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and Borrower
shall be in compliance in all material respects with all terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in each other Loan Document on Borrower's part
to be observed or performed. Lender shall have received a certificate from
Borrower confirming the foregoing, stating that the representations and
warranties of Borrower contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
are true and correct on and as of the date of the release and substitution with
respect to Borrower, the Properties and the Substitute Property and containing
any other representations and warranties with respect to Borrower, the
Properties, the Substitute Property or the Loan as (i) Lender, if a
Securitization has not occurred, or (ii) the Rating Agencies, if a
Securitization has occurred, may reasonably require, unless such certificate
would be inaccurate, such certificate to be in form and substance satisfactory
to Lender or the Rating Agencies, as applicable.

      (i) Borrower shall have executed, acknowledged and delivered to Lender (I)
a Mortgage and two UCC-1 Financing Statements with respect to the Substitute
Property, together with a letter from Borrower countersigned by a title
insurance company acknowledging receipt of such Mortgage and UCC-1 Financing
Statements and agreeing to record or file, as applicable, such Mortgage and one
of the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the real estate records for the county in
which the Substitute Property is located and to file one of the UCC-1 Financing
Statements in the office of the Secretary of State (or other central filing
office) of the State in which the Substitute Property is located, so as to
effectively create upon such recording and filing valid and enforceable first
priority Liens upon the Substitute Property, in favor of Lender (or such other
trustee as may be desired under local law), subject only to the Permitted
Encumbrances and such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan
Documents and (II) an environmental indemnity with respect to the Substitute
Property from Borrower Principal. The Mortgage and UCC-1 Financing Statements
and environmental indemnity shall be the same in form and substance as the
counterparts of such documents executed and delivered with respect to the
related Release Property subject to modifications reflecting only the Substitute
Property as the Individual Property and such modifications reflecting the laws
of the State in which the Substitute Property is located. The Mortgage
encumbering the Substitute Property shall secure all amounts then outstanding
under the Note, provided that in the event that the jurisdiction in which the
Substitute Property is located imposes a mortgage recording, intangibles or
similar tax and does not permit the allocation of indebtedness for the purpose
of determining the amount of such tax payable, the principal amount secured by
such Mortgage shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
Allocated Loan Amount of the Substitute Property. The amount of the Loan
allocated to the Substitute Property (such amount being hereinafter referred to
as the "SUBSTITUTE ALLOCATED LOAN AMOUNT") shall equal the Allocated Loan Amount
of the related Release Property.

                                       33

<PAGE>

      (j) Lender shall have received (A) to the extent available in the
applicable jurisdictions, any "tie-in" or similar endorsement, together with a

the existing Mortgages as of the date of the substitution with respect to the
Title Insurance Policy insuring the Lien of the Mortgage with respect to the
Substitute Property and (B) a Title Insurance Policy (or a marked, signed and
redated commitment to issue such Title Insurance Policy) insuring the Lien of
the Mortgage encumbering the Substitute Property, issued by the title company
that issued the Title Insurance Policies insuring the Lien of the existing
Mortgages and dated as of the date of the substitution, with reinsurance and
direct access agreements that replace such agreements issued in connection with
the Title Insurance Policy insuring the Lien of the Mortgage encumbering the
Release Property. The Title Insurance Policy issued with respect to the
Substitute Property shall (1) provide coverage in the amount of the Substitute
Allocated Loan Amount if the "tie-in" or similar endorsement described above is
available or, if such endorsement is not available, in an amount equal to one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Substitute Allocated Loan Amount,
together with "last dollar endorsement," (2) insure Lender that the relevant
Mortgage creates a valid first Lien on the Substitute Property encumbered
thereby, free and clear of all exceptions from coverage other than Permitted

coverages as are then available and are contained in the Title Insurance

mortgage lender would require, and (4) name Lender as the insured. Lender also
shall have received copies of paid receipts or other evidence showing that all
premiums in respect of such endorsements and Title Insurance Policies have been

to the Rating Agencies in accordance with the 1999 Minimum Standard Detail
Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys. Such Survey shall reflect the
same legal description contained in the Title Insurance Policy relating to such
Substitute Property and shall include, among other things, a metes and bounds
description of the real property comprising part of such Substitute Property
(unless such real property has been satisfactorily designated by lot number on a
recorded plat). The surveyor's seal shall be affixed to each Survey and each
Survey shall certify whether or not the surveyed property is located in a
"one-hundred-year flood hazard area."

      (l) Lender shall have received valid certificates of insurance indicating
that the requirements for the policies of insurance required for an Individual
Property hereunder have been satisfied with respect to the Substitute Property
and evidence of the payment of all Insurance Premiums payable for the existing
policy period.

limitation, that the original Loan Documents were enforceable) as to the laws

insurance coverages, amounts and other

                                       47

Individual Property or impairs Borrower's ability to pay its obligations in a
timely manner.

Borrower's ability to pay its obligations in a timely manner.

Component Entity and, if an opinion letter pertaining to substantive
consolidation was required at closing, deliver a new opinion letter acceptable

      (c) In the event Borrower is a single member Delaware limited liability
company, the limited liability company agreement of Borrower (the "LLC
AGREEMENT") shall provide that (i) upon the occurrence of any event that causes
the sole member of Borrower ("MEMBER") to cease to be the member of Borrower
(other than (A) upon an assignment by Member of all of its limited liability
company interest in Borrower and the admission of the transferee in accordance
with the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement, or (B) the resignation of Member
and the admission of an additional member of Borrower in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement), any person acting as
Independent Director of Borrower shall, without any action of any other Person
and simultaneously with the Member ceasing to be the member of Borrower,
automatically be admitted to Borrower ("SPECIAL MEMBER") and shall continue
Borrower without dissolution and (ii) Special Member may not resign from
Borrower or transfer its rights as Special Member unless (A) a successor Special
Member has been admitted to Borrower as Special Member in accordance with
requirements of Delaware law and (B) such successor Special Member has also
accepted its appointment as an Independent Director. The LLC Agreement shall
further provide that (i) Special

                                       64
<PAGE>

Member shall automatically cease to be a member of Borrower upon the admission
to Borrower of a substitute Member, (ii) Special Member shall be a member of
Borrower that has no interest in the profits, losses and capital of Borrower and
has no right to receive any distributions of Borrower assets, (iii) pursuant to
Section 18-301 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "ACT"),
Special Member shall not be required to make any capital contributions to
Borrower and shall not receive a limited liability company interest in Borrower,
(iv) Special Member, in its capacity as Special Member, may not bind Borrower
and (v) except as required by any mandatory provision of the Act, Special
Member, in its capacity as Special Member, shall have no right to vote on,
approve or otherwise consent to any action by, or matter relating to, Borrower,
including, without limitation, the merger, consolidation or conversion of
Borrower; provided, however, such prohibition shall not limit the obligations of
Special Member, in its capacity as Independent Director, to vote on such matters
required by the Loan Documents or the LLC Agreement. In order to implement the
admission to Borrower of Special Member, Special Member shall execute a
counterpart to the LLC Agreement. Prior to its admission to Borrower as Special
Member, Special Member shall not be a member of Borrower.

      Upon the occurrence of any event that causes the Member to cease to be a
member of Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the personal
representative of Member shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of
the event that terminated the continued membership of Member in Borrower, agree
in writing (i) to continue Borrower and (ii) to the admission of the personal
representative or its nominee or designee, as the case may be, as a substitute
member of Borrower, effective as of the occurrence of the event that terminated
the continued membership of Member of Borrower in Borrower. Any action initiated
by or brought against Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws
shall not cause Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of Borrower and
upon the occurrence of such an event, the business of Borrower shall continue
without dissolution. The LLC Agreement shall provide that each of Member and
Special Member waives any right it might have to agree in writing to dissolve
Borrower upon the occurrence of any action initiated by or brought against
Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws, or the occurrence of
an event that causes Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of
Borrower.

      Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed (a) Borrower's name, (b)
Borrower's identity (including its trade name or names), (c) Borrower's
principal place of business set forth on the first page of this Agreement, (d)
the corporate, partnership or other organizational structure of Borrower, each
SPE Component Entity (if any), or Borrower Principal, (e) Borrower's state of
organization, or (f) Borrower's organizational identification number, without in
each case notifying Lender of such change in writing at least thirty (30) days
prior to the effective date of such change and, in the case of a change in
Borrower's structure, without first obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender. In addition, Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed any
organizational documents of Borrower or any SPE Component Entity (if any) if
such change would adversely impact the covenants set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.4

                                       65

statement amendment required by Lender to establish or maintain the validity,
perfection and priority of the security interest granted herein. At the request
of Lender, Borrower shall execute a certificate in form satisfactory to Lender
listing the trade names under which Borrower intends to operate the Properties,
and representing and warranting that Borrower does business under no other trade
name with respect to the Properties. If Borrower does not now have an
organizational identification number and later obtains one, or if the
organizational identification number assigned to Borrower subsequently changes,
Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of such organizational identification
number or change.

      (a) The organizational documents of each SPE Component Entity (if any)
shall provide that at all times there shall be, and Borrower shall cause there
to be, at least two duly appointed members of the board of directors (each an
"INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR") of such SPE Component Entity reasonably satisfactory to
Lender each of whom are not at the time of such individual's initial
appointment, and shall not have been at any time during the preceding five (5)
years, and shall not be at any time while serving as a director of such SPE
Component Entity, either (i) a shareholder (or other equity owner) of, or an

      (b) The organizational documents of each SPE Component Entity (if any)
shall provide that the board of directors of such SPE Component Entity shall not
take any action which, under the terms of any certificate of incorporation,
by-laws or any voting trust agreement with respect to any common stock, requires
an unanimous vote of the board of directors of such SPE Component Entity of
Borrower unless at the time of such action there shall be at least two members
of the board of directors who are Independent Directors. Such SPE Component
Entity will not, without the unanimous written consent of its board of directors
including each Independent Director, on behalf of itself or Borrower, (i) file

to take advantage of any applicable Creditors Rights Laws; (ii) seek or consent
to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator or any similar official; (iii) take

fee simple and/or leasehold title to the Properties, as applicable, is vested in
the Qualified Transferee

                                       69

documents relating to the organization and formation of Transferee and of the
entities, if any, which are partners or members of the Qualified Transferee. The

      (j) if required by Lender, Lender shall have received confirmation in
writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that the
transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

      (k) Transferee shall assume the obligations of Borrower under any
Management Agreement or provide a new management agreement with a new manager
which meets with the requirements of Section 5.14 hereof and assign to Lender as
additional security such new management agreement;

      (l) Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale pursuant to which
the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject to the satisfaction
of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.5; and

      (m) The Qualified Transferee shall, prior to such transfer, deliver a
substantive non-consolidation opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form,
scope and substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating

pursuant to this

                                       70
<PAGE>

consent to any subsequent transfer of the Properties or any part thereof.

obligations and liabilities in a manner acceptable to Lender, Borrower shall be
released from its obligations under the Loan and the Loan Documents from and

principal (which borrower principal shall be approved in writing by Lender)
shall have assumed all of the obligations and liabilities of Borrower Principal
in a manner acceptable to Lender, Borrower Principal shall be released from its
obligations under the Loan and the Loan Documents to which they are a party from
and after the date of sale or transfer.

      equal to the maximum amount of such insurance available under the National
      Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 or
      the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each may be amended;
      and (z) earthquake insurance in amounts and in form and substance
      reasonably satisfactory to Lender in the event the Individual Property is
      located in

<PAGE>

      an area with a high degree of seismic risk, provided that the insurance
      pursuant to clauses (y) and (z) hereof shall be on terms consistent with
      the comprehensive all risk insurance policy required under this subsection
      (i);

            (ii) Commercial General Liability insurance against claims for
      personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon,
      in or about the Individual Property, with such insurance (A) to be on the
      so-called "occurrence" form with a general aggregate limit of not less
      than $2,000,000 and a per occurrence limit of not less than $1,000,000;
      (B) to continue at not less than the aforesaid limit until required to be
      changed by Lender in writing by reason of changed economic conditions
      making such protection inadequate; and (C) to cover at least the following
      hazards: (1) premises and operations; (2) products and completed
      operations; (3) independent contractors; and (4) blanket contractual
      liability as described in a standard commercial general liability policy
      form CG00010798;

            (iii) loss of rents insurance or business income insurance, as
      applicable, (A) with loss payable to Lender; (B) covering all risks
      required to be covered by the insurance provided for in subsection (i)
      above; and (C)(I)(1) in an amount equal to 100% of the projected Business
      Income from each Individual Property (on an actual loss sustained basis)
      for a period continuing until the Restoration of the Individual Property
      is completed and income returns to the same level it was at prior to the
      loss (not to exceed eighteen (18) months), based on the greatest of: (x)
      Borrower's reasonable estimate of the Business Income from each Individual
      Property and (y) the highest Business Income received during the term of
      the Note for any full calendar year prior to the date the amount of such
      insurance is being determined and (2) which contains an extended period of
      indemnity endorsement which provides that after the physical loss to the
      Improvements and Personal Property has been repaired, the continued loss
      of income will be insured until such income either returns to the same
      level it was at prior to the loss, or the expiration of six (6) months
      from the date that such Individual Property is repaired or replaced and
      operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding that
      the policy may expire prior to the end of such period or (II) pursuant to
      a blanket insurance Policy which provides for such coverages set forth in
      (C)(I)(1) and (2) above for each Individual Property with per occurrence
      limits of not less than the highest amounts attributable to an Individual
      Property as calculated pursuant to (C)(I) above; in either case, the
      amount of such business income/loss of rents insurance shall be determined
      prior to the Closing Date and at least once each year thereafter based on
      Borrower's reasonable estimate of the gross income from such Individual
      Property for the succeeding period of coverage required above. All
      proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this subsection shall be held by
      Lender and shall be applied to the obligations secured by the Loan
      Documents from time to time due and payable hereunder and under the Note;
      provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
      relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations secured by the
      Loan Documents on the respective dates of payment provided for in the
      Note, this Agreement and

                                       72
<PAGE>

      the other Loan Documents except to the extent such amounts are actually
      paid out of the proceeds of such loss of rents or business income
      insurance, as applicable;

            (iv) at all times during which structural construction, substantial
      repairs or alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements,
      and only if the Individual Property coverage form does not otherwise
      apply, (A) owner's contingent or protective liability insurance covering
      claims not covered by or under the terms or provisions of the above
      mentioned commercial general liability insurance policy; and (B) the
      insurance provided for in subsection (i) above written in a so-called
      Builder's Risk Completed Value form (1) on a non-reporting basis, (2)
      against "all risks" insured against pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3)
      including permission to occupy the Individual Property, and (4) with an
      agreed amount endorsement waiving co-insurance provisions;

            (v) workers' compensation, subject to the statutory limits of the
      State, and employer's liability insurance in respect of any work or
      operations on or about the Individual Property, or in connection with such
      Individual Property or its operation (if applicable);

            (vi) comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if applicable, in
      amounts as shall be reasonably required by Lender on terms consistent with
      the commercial property insurance policy required under subsection (i)
      above;

            (vii) excess liability insurance in an amount not less than
      $25,000,000.00 per occurrence and $50,000,000.00 aggregate on terms
      consistent with the commercial general liability insurance required under
      subsection (ii) above;

            (viii) Customer Goods Liability for amounts of not less than
      $250,000; and

            (ix) upon sixty (60) days' written notice, such other reasonable
      insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to time may
      reasonably request against such other insurable hazards which at the time
      are commonly insured against for property similar to the Individual
      Property located in or around the region in which such Individual Property
      is located.

      With respect to the Policies required to be maintained pursuant to clauses
(i) through (ix) above, Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts,
consistent with those of prudent owners of institutional quality commercial real
estate, to maintain insurance coverage against Losses resulting from acts of
terrorism.

      (b) All insurance provided for in Section 8.1 (a) shall be obtained under
valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or in the singular,
the "POLICY"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to insurance
companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The Policies shall be
issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies authorized to do
business in the State and having a claims paying ability rating of "A+" or
better by at least two Rating Agencies, one of

                                       73
<PAGE>

which must be S&P or such other Rating Agencies approved by Lender, provided,
however, the Policies may be issued by a syndicate of insurers through which (1)
at least 75% of the coverage (if there are 4 or fewer members of the syndicate)
or at least 60% of the coverage (if there are 5 or more members of the
syndicate), shall be with one or more carriers having a claims paying ability
rating of "A+" or better by at least two Rating Agencies, one of which must be
S&P or such other Rating Agencies approved by Lender, (2) subject to the
requirements of subsection (1) above, no more than 15% of the coverage (if there
are 4 or fewer members of the syndicate) or no more than 30% of the coverage (if
there are 5 or more members of the syndicate), shall be with one or more
carriers having a claims paying ability rating of "A" or better by at least two
Rating Agencies, one of which must be S&P or such other Rating Agencies approved
by Lender and (3) the balance of the coverage not to exceed 10% of claims
coverage is with one or more carriers having a general policy rating of "A" or
better and a financial class of "XII" or better by A.M. Best Company, Inc. All
Policies described in Sections 8.1(a)(ii), (v) and (vii) shall be issued by
financially sound and responsible insurance companies having a claims paying
ability rating of "A" or better by at least two Rating Agencies approved by
Lender and a general policy rating of "A-" or better and a financial class of
"VIII" or better by A.M. Best Company, Inc. The Policies described in Section
8.1(a) shall designate Lender and its successors and assigns as additional
insureds, mortgagees and/or loss payee as deemed appropriate by Lender. To the
extent such Policies are not available as of the Closing Date, Borrower shall
deliver certified copies of all Policies to Lender not later than thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration
dates of the Policies theretofore furnished to Lender, renewal Policies
accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of payment of the premiums due
thereunder (the "INSURANCE PREMIUMS") shall be delivered by Borrower to Lender.

      (c) Any blanket insurance Policy required pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i)
hereof, shall specifically allocate to the Individual Property the amount of
coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall otherwise provide the
same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only such Individual
Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(a).

      (d) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 8.1(a), except
for the Policy referenced in Section 8.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as the
insured or the additional insured and Lender as the additional insured, as its
interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler and machinery,
flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called New York standard
non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss
thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

      (e) All Policies provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall contain clauses or
endorsements to the effect that:

            (i) no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower,
      or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with the
      provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of
      the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
      enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;

                                       74
<PAGE>

            (ii) the Policies shall not be materially changed (other than to
      increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at least
      thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender and any other party named
      therein as an additional insured;

            (iii) the issuers thereof shall give written notice to Lender if the
      Policies have not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to its expiration;
      and

            (iv) Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon
      or subject to any assessments thereunder.

      (f) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all
insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have the
right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems necessary
to protect its interest in any Individual Property, including, without
limitation, obtaining such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion
deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the
Mortgages and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

      Section 8.2 Casualty

      If any Individual Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in
part, by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower (to the extent Borrower
has received notice of such damage or destruction) shall give Lender prompt
notice of such damage and Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently
prosecute the Restoration of such Individual Property in accordance with Section
8.4, whether or not Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section
8.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs
are covered by insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Borrower shall adjust all claims for
Insurance Proceeds in consultation with, and approval of, Lender; provided,
however, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall
have the exclusive right to participate in the adjustment of all claims for
Insurance Proceeds.

      Section 8.3 Condemnation

      Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of any Individual Property
of which Borrower has received notice and shall deliver to Lender copies of any
and all papers served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may
participate in any such proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time
deliver to Lender all instruments requested by it to permit such participation.
Borrower shall, at its expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and
shall consult with Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in
the carrying on or defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking
by any public or quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise
(including but not limited to any transfer made in lieu of or

                                       75
<PAGE>

in anticipation of the exercise of such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay
the Debt at the time and in the manner provided for its payment in the Note and
in this Agreement and the Debt shall not be reduced until any Award shall have
been actually received and applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of
collection, to the reduction or discharge of the Debt, provided, however, after
payment in full of the Debt, any excess proceeds received by Lender shall be
distributed in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Cash Management
Agreement. Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the
condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award interest
at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note. If any Individual Property
or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority, Borrower shall
promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of such Individual
Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 8.4, whether or not
Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4. If an
Individual Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the
receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a
deficiency judgment on the Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to
receive the Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

      Section 8.4 Restoration

      The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration of
the Properties:

      (a) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than $9,000,000.00 (as the same may
be adjusted by increases in CPI in a manner consistent with increases in Base
Rent pursuant to the Operating Lease) and the costs of completing the
Restoration shall be less than $9,000,000.00 (as the same may be adjusted by
increases in CPI in a manner consistent with increases in Base Rent pursuant to
the Operating Lease), the Net Proceeds will be disbursed by Lender to Borrower
upon receipt, provided that all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i)
are met and Borrower delivers to Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously
commence and to satisfactorily complete with due diligence the Restoration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

      (b) If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than $9,000,000.00 (as the
same may be adjusted by increases in CPI in a manner consistent with increases
in Base Rent pursuant to the Operating Lease) or the costs of completing the
Restoration are equal to or greater than $9,000,000.00 (as the same may be
adjusted by increases in CPI in a manner consistent with increases in Base Rent
pursuant to the Operating Lease), Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available
for the Restoration in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4. The
term "NET PROCEEDS" for purposes of this Section 8.4 shall mean: (i) the net
amount of all insurance proceeds received by Lender pursuant to Section
8.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (ix) as a result of a Casualty, after deduction of its
reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel
fees), if any, in collecting the same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net
amount of the Award as a result of a Condemnation, after deduction of its
reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel
fees), if any, in collecting the same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the
case may be.

                                       76
<PAGE>

            (i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for
      Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                  (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

                  (B) (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance Proceeds,
            less than twenty percent (20%) of the total aggregate floor area of
            the Improvements on the Properties have been damaged, destroyed or
            rendered unusable as a result of a Casualty or (2) in the event the
            Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less than ten percent (10%)
            of the land constituting the Properties is taken;

                  (C) The Operating Leases shall remain in full force and effect
            during and after the completion of the Restoration without abatement
            of rent beyond the time required for Restoration;

                  (D) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as
            reasonably practicable (but, subject to Force Majeure, in no event
            later than sixty (60) days after such Casualty or Condemnation,
            whichever the case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the
            same to satisfactory completion;

                  (E) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits,
            including all scheduled payments of principal and interest under the
            Note, which will be incurred with respect to an Individual Property
            as a result of the occurrence of any such Casualty or Condemnation,
            whichever the case may be, will be covered out of the insurance
            coverage referred to in Section 8.1(a)(iii) above;

                  (F) Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
            completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) six (6) months
            prior to the Maturity Date, (2) the earliest date required for such
            completion under the terms of any Leases or material agreements
            affecting the Individual Property, (3) such time as may be required
            under applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or (4)
            the expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
            8.1(a)(iii);

                  (G) the Individual Property and the use thereof after the
            Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all Legal
            Requirements;

                  (H) the Restoration shall be done and completed by Borrower in
            an expeditious and diligent fashion and in compliance with all
            applicable Legal Requirements;

                                       77
<PAGE>

                  (I) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not
            result in the loss of access to the Individual Property or the
            Improvements;

                  (J) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
            Lender a signed detailed budget approved in writing by Borrower's
            architect or engineer stating the entire cost of completing the
            Restoration, which budget shall be acceptable to Lender; and

                  (K) the Net Proceeds together with any cash or cash equivalent
            deposited by Borrower or Operating Lessee with Lender are sufficient
            in Lender's reasonable judgment to cover the cost of the
            Restoration.

            (ii) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender until disbursements
      commence, and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this
      Section 8.4, shall constitute additional security for the Debt and other
      obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be held in an
      interest-bearing business savings account and interest shall be credited
      to Borrower, but such interest shall be held in such account. The Net
      Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from
      time to time during the course of the Restoration, upon receipt of
      evidence satisfactory to Lender that (A) all the conditions precedent to
      such advance, including those set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i), have been
      satisfied, (B) all materials installed and work and labor performed
      (except to the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested
      disbursement) in connection with the related Restoration item have been
      paid for in full, and (C) there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders,
      mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of intention to file same, or
      any other Liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever on the Individual
      Property which have not either been fully bonded to the satisfaction of
      Lender and discharged of record or in the alternative fully insured to the
      satisfaction of Lender by the title company issuing the Title Insurance
      Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Insurance Proceeds from the
      Policies required to be maintained by Borrower pursuant to Section
      8.1(a)(iii) shall be controlled by Lender at all times, shall not be
      subject to the provisions of this Section 8.4 and shall be used solely for
      the payment of the obligations then due and payable under the Loan
      Documents and for the payment of Operating Expenses.

            (iii) All plans and specifications required in connection with the
      Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in all
      respects by Lender and by an independent consulting engineer selected by
      Lender (the "RESTORATION CONSULTANT"), which approval shall not be
      unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Lender shall have the use
      of the plans and specifications and all permits, licenses and approvals
      required or obtained in connection with the Restoration. The identity of
      the contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the
      Restoration, as well as the contracts in excess of $50,000 under which
      they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review and acceptance by

                                       78
<PAGE>

      Lender and the Restoration Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by
      Lender in connection with making the Net Proceeds available for the
      Restoration, including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
      disbursements and the Restoration Consultant's fees, shall be paid by
      Borrower.

            (iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
      the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually
      incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration,
      as certified by the Restoration Consultant, minus the Restoration
      Retainage. The term "RESTORATION RETAINAGE" shall mean an amount equal to
      ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part
      of the Restoration, as certified by the Restoration Consultant, until the
      Restoration has been completed. The Restoration Retainage shall be reduced
      to five percent (5%) of the costs incurred upon receipt by Lender of
      satisfactory evidence that fifty percent (50%) of the Restoration has been
      completed. The Restoration Retainage shall in no event, and
      notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section
      8.4(b), be less than the amount actually held back by Borrower from
      contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration.
      The Restoration Retainage shall not be released until the Restoration
      Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in
      accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b) and that all
      approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the Individual
      Property have been obtained from all appropriate Governmental Authorities,
      and Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the
      Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the
      Restoration Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the
      portion of the Restoration Retainage being held with respect to any
      contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as of
      the date upon which the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that
      the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed
      all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions
      of the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the
      contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the Lien waivers and
      evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the contractor,
      subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender or
      by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy, and Lender
      receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy insuring the
      continued priority of the Lien of the Mortgages and evidence of payment of
      any premium payable for such endorsement. If required by Lender, the
      release of any such portion of the Restoration Retainage shall be approved
      by the surety company, if any, which has issued a payment or performance
      bond with respect to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

            (v) Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net
      Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

            (vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance
      thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in consultation
      with the Restoration Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance
      of the costs which are estimated by the Restoration Consultant to be
      incurred in connection with the

                                       79
<PAGE>

      completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the
      "NET PROCEEDS DEFICIENCY") with Lender before any further disbursement of
      the Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with
      Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually
      incurred in connection with the Restoration on the same conditions
      applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed
      pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) shall constitute additional security for
      the Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents.

            (vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
      balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender
      after the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration
      has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section
      8.4(b), and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that
      all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in
      full, shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of
      Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this
      Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

      (c) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 8.4(b)(vii) may (x) be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority
and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, (y) at
the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part,
to Borrower for such purposes and upon such conditions as Lender shall
designate.

      (d) In the event of foreclosure of any Mortgage, or other transfer of
title to any Individual Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the
Debt, all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in
force concerning such Individual Property and all proceeds payable thereunder
shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure, Lender or other
transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.

commercially reasonable after commencing to make each such Replacement.

      (b) Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent as security for Borrower's obligations to cause
Replacements to be completed (the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE ACCOUNT") into which
Borrower shall deposit on the date hereof $600,000.00. Amounts so deposited
shall hereinafter be referred TO as "REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUNDS".

      Section 9.3 Groundwater Monitoring Reserve Funds.

      (a) Borrower shall perform all testing, monitoring and other work,
including without limitation, the creation of three (3) monitoring wells and six
(6) semi-annual reviews of such wells (the "GROUNDWATER MONITORING EVENTS") in

services applicable to each Groundwater Monitoring Event have been paid in full,

Lender's disbursement of Groundwater Monitoring Reserve Funds or other
acknowledgment of completion of any Groundwater Monitoring Events shall not be
deemed a certification or warranty by Lender to any Person that the Groundwater
Monitoring Events has been completed in accordance with Legal Requirements.

      Section 9.4 Required Work

      Borrower shall diligently pursue all Required Repairs and Replacements
(collectively, the "REQUIRED WORK") to completion in accordance with the
following requirements:

      (a) Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all contracts or
work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors, contractors
or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the Required
Work to the extent

                                       81
<PAGE>

such contracts or work orders exceed the Threshold Amount. Upon Lender's
request, Borrower shall assign any contract or subcontract to Lender.

      (b) In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that any
Required Work is not being or has not been performed in a workmanlike or timely
manner, Lender shall have the option to proceed under existing contracts or to
contract with third parties to complete such Required Work and to apply the
Replacement Reserve Funds, as applicable, toward the labor and materials
necessary to complete such Required Work, without providing any prior notice to
Borrower and to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender upon an
Event of Default hereunder.

      (c) In order to facilitate Lender's completion of the Required Work,
Borrower grants Lender, subject to the rights of Operating Lessee, the right to
enter onto the Properties and perform any and all work and labor necessary to
complete the Required Work and/or employ watchmen to protect the Properties from
damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Reserve
Funds, shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and
secured by the Mortgages. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints
Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to
complete or undertake the Required Work in the name of Borrower upon Borrower's
failure to do so in a workmanlike and timely manner. Such power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any of the
Reserve Funds for the purpose of making or completing the Required Work; (ii) to
make such additions, changes and corrections to the Required Work as shall be
necessary or desirable to complete the Required Work; (iii) to employ such
contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be
required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills
and claims which are or may become Liens against any Individual Property, or as
may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Required Work, or for
clearance of title; (v) to execute all applications and certificates in the name
of Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the
Properties or the rehabilitation and repair of the Properties; and (vii) to do
any and every act which Borrower might do on its own behalf to fulfill the terms
of this Agreement.

      (d) Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall: (i) make Lender responsible for
making or completing the Required Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds in
addition to the Reserve Funds to make or complete any Required Work; (iii)
obligate Lender to proceed with the Required Work; or (iv) obligate Lender to
demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Required Work.

      (e) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and representatives
(including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or inspector) or
third parties performing Required Work pursuant to this Section 9.4 to enter
onto the Properties during normal business hours (subject to the rights of
tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Required Work and all
materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans and shop
drawings relating to such Required Work which are or may be kept at the
Properties, and to complete any Required Work made pursuant

                                       82
<PAGE>

to this Section 9.4. Borrower shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to
cooperate with Lender and Lender's representatives or such other persons
described above in connection with inspections described in this Section 9.4 or
the completion of Required Work pursuant to this Section 9.4.

      (f) Lender may, to the extent any Required Work would reasonably require
an inspection of the Properties, inspect the Properties at Borrower's expense in
order to verify completion of the Required Work for which reimbursement is
sought. Borrower shall pay Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding
$1,000 for each such inspection. Lender may require that such inspection be
conducted by an appropriate independent qualified professional selected by
Lender and/or may require a copy of a certificate of completion by an
independent qualified professional acceptable to Lender. Borrower shall pay the
expense of the inspection as required hereunder, whether such inspection is
conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified professional.

      (g) The Required Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any other
item comprising a part of any Required Work shall be constructed, installed or
completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialman's or
other Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

      (h) Intentionally Omitted.

      (i) All Required Work shall comply with all Legal Requirements and
applicable insurance requirements including, without limitation, applicable
building codes, special use permits, environmental regulations, and requirements
of insurance underwriters.

      (j) Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all rights and claims Borrower may
have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such rights or
claims unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured and Lender
grants to Borrower a revocable license with respect to all such Persons
supplying labor or materials in connection with the Required Work.

      Section 9.5 Release of Reserve Funds

      (a) Borrower shall have no right to receive any disbursements or
reimbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account; provided, however, upon the
payment in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if any, in the
Replacement Reserve Account shall be returned to Borrower or the Person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Properties and no other party shall
have any right or claim thereto.

      Section 9.6 Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds

      Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent sufficient to discharge Borrower's obligations for the
payment of Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1
hereof (the "TAX AND

                                       83
<PAGE>

INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT") into which Borrower shall deposit on the date hereof
$840,739.17, which amount, when added to the required monthly deposits set forth
in the next sentence, is sufficient to make the payments of Taxes and Insurance
Premiums as required herein. Borrower shall deposit into the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Account on each Scheduled Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes that
Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months or
such higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay
all such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of (i) the date
that the same will become delinquent and (ii) the date that additional charges
or interest will accrue due to the non-payment thereof, and (b) except to the
extent Lender has waived the insurance escrow because the insurance required
hereunder is maintained under a blanket insurance Policy acceptable to Lender in
accordance with Section 8.1(c), one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that
Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months for
the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof
or such higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to
pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called
the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS"). Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Funds to (a) payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be
made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof or (b) upon
delivery to Lender of evidence of the prior payment of such Taxes and/or
Insurance Premiums, to reimburse Borrower (or such other Person designated by
Borrower) for any such payments made by Borrower (or such other Person) from its
own funds. In making any disbursement from the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Account, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured
from the appropriate public office or tax lien service (with respect to Taxes)
or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into
the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any
tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the
amount of the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds shall exceed the amounts due for
Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof,
Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit
such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Account, In allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with the person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Properties. Any amount remaining in
the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account after the Debt has been paid in full shall
be returned to Borrower or the person shown on Lender's records as being the
owner of the Properties and no other party shall have any right or claim
thereto. If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Funds are not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance
Premiums by the dates set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify
Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall pay to Lender any amount
necessary to make up the deficiency within ten (10) days after notice from
Lender to Borrower requesting payment thereof.

      Section 9.7 Required DSCR Reserve.

      (a) Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent (the "REQUIRED DSCR RESERVE ACCOUNT") into which
Borrower shall deposit on the date hereof the amount of $30,000,000.00 to be
held in

                                       84
<PAGE>

escrow as additional security for the Loan. Amounts so deposited shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "REQUIRED DSCR RESERVE FUNDS".

      (b) Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, commencing on November 1, 2004, upon
written request from Borrower (not to exceed two (2) times per calendar year),
Lender shall disburse to Borrower any sums from the Required DSCR Reserve
Account which Lender determines are in excess of those amounts (factoring in all
accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid and any additional costs, if
any, as a result of such prepayment ) that if used to prepay the Loan would the
result in a Required DSCR Operations Debt Service Coverage Ratio of not less
than 1.60:1.00 assuming a loan constant equal to nine and one-quarter percent
(9.25%) based on the immediately preceding twelve (12) month period.

      Section 9.8 Reserve Account Balances.

      (a) Upon payment in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if
any, in the Reserve Accounts shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower and, in
either case, no other party shall have any right or claim thereto.

      Section 9.9 Reserve Funds Generally

      (a) Other than as provided in Section 9.9(b) below, neither Lender nor any
loan servicer that at any time holds or maintains the Reserve Accounts shall
have any obligation to keep or maintain such Reserve Accounts or any funds
deposited therein in interest-bearing accounts. Other than as provided in
Section 9.9(b) below, if Lender or any such loan servicer elects in its sole and
absolute discretion to keep or maintain any Reserve Account or any funds
deposited therein in an interest-bearing account, (i) such funds shall not be
invested except in Permitted Investments, and (ii) all interest earned or
accrued thereon shall be for the account of and be retained by Lender or such
loan servicer.

      (b) Funds deposited in the Replacement Reserve Account and the Required
DSCR Reserve Account shall be held in an interest-bearing business savings
account and interest shall be credited to Borrower, but such interest shall be
held in the applicable Account; provided, however, Borrower and Lender hereby
authorize and direct Agent to distribute on the first Payment Date of each
calendar year all income earned on the Required DSCR Reserve Funds (1) into the
Cash Management Account or (2) as otherwise directed by Borrower in order to
comply with Legal Requirements relating to security deposits; provided, however,
Agent shall not distribute any such income for so long as an Event of Default
exists. In no event shall Lender or any loan servicer that at any time holds or
maintains the Replacement Reserve Account and/or the Required DSCR Reserve
Account be required to select any particular interest-bearing account or the
account that yields the highest rate of interest, provided that selection of the
account shall be consistent with the general standards at the time being
utilized by Lender or the loan servicer, as applicable, in establishing similar
accounts for loans of comparable type. All such interest shall be and become
part of the Replacement Reserve Account or,

                                       85
<PAGE>

except as provided above, the Required DSCR Reserve Account; provided, however,
that Lender may, at its election, retain any such interest for its own account
during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default. Borrower agrees
that it shall include all interest on Replacement Reserve Funds and Required
DSCR Reserve Account as the income of Borrower (and, if Borrower is a
partnership or other pass-through entity, the partners, members or beneficiaries
of Borrower, as the case may be), and shall be the owner of the Replacement
Reserve Funds and Required DSCR Reserve Funds for federal and applicable state
and local tax purposes, except to the extent that Lender retains any interest
for its own account during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default
as provided herein.

      (c) Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security interest
in, and assigns and pledges to Lender, each of the Reserve Accounts and any and
all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts as
additional security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in
accordance herewith, the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. The provisions of this Section 9.9 are
intended to give Lender or any subsequent holder of the Loan "control" of the
Reserve Accounts within the meaning of the UCC.

      (d) The Reserve Accounts and any and all Reserve Funds now or hereafter
deposited in the Reserve Accounts shall be subject to the exclusive dominion and
control of Lender, which shall hold the Reserve Accounts and any or all Reserve
Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. Borrower shall have no right of withdrawal
from the Reserve Accounts or any other right or power with respect to the
Reserve Accounts or any or all of the Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited
in the Reserve Accounts, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

      (e) Lender shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Borrower, without
charge, an annual accounting of each Reserve Account in the normal format of
Lender or its loan servicer, showing credits and debits to such Reserve Account
and the purpose for which each debit to each Reserve Account was made.

      (f) As long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender
shall make disbursements from the Reserve Accounts in accordance with this
Agreement. All such disbursements shall be deemed to have been expressly
pre-authorized by Borrower, and shall not be deemed to constitute the exercise
by Lender of any remedies against Borrower unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and Lender has expressly stated in writing its intent
to proceed to exercise its remedies as a secured party, pledgee or lienholder
with respect to the Reserve Accounts.

      (g) If any Event of Default occurs, Borrower shall immediately lose all of
its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve Accounts until the earlier
to occur of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured to Lender's
satisfaction, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt. Upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default, Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies
as a secured party, pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Reserve Accounts.
Without limitation of the foregoing, upon any

                                       86
<PAGE>

Event of Default, Lender may use and disburse the Reserve Funds (or any portion
thereof) for any of the following purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt,
including, but not limited to, principal prepayments and the prepayment premium
applicable to such full or partial prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement
of Lender for all losses, fees, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of
such Event of Default; (C) payment of any amount expended in exercising any or
all rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under this
Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item from
any of the Reserve Accounts as required or permitted under this Agreement; or
(E) any other purpose permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that any
such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of
Default. Without limiting any other provisions hereof, each of the remedial
actions described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a
commercially reasonable exercise of Lender's rights and remedies as a secured
party with respect to the Reserve Funds and shall not in any event be deemed to
constitute a setoff or a foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in
this Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve
Funds to effect a cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any
specific order of priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's rights and
remedies under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents shall not
in any way prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate and complete a
foreclosure under the Mortgages.

      (h) The Reserve Funds shall not constitute escrow or trust funds and may
be commingled with other monies held by Lender. Notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, Lender may commingle in one or more Eligible Accounts
any and all funds controlled by Lender, including, without limitation, funds
pledged in favor of Lender by other borrowers, whether for the same purposes as
the Reserve Accounts or otherwise. Without limiting any other provisions of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Reserve Accounts may be established
and held in such name or names as Lender or its loan servicer, as agent for
Lender, shall deem appropriate, including, without limitation, in the name of
Lender or such loan servicer as agent for Lender. In the case of any Reserve
Account which is held in a commingled account, Lender or its loan servicer, as
applicable, shall maintain records sufficient to enable it to determine at all
times which portion of such account is related to the Loan. The Reserve Accounts
are solely for the protection of Lender. With respect to the Reserve Accounts,
Lender shall have no responsibility beyond the allowance of due credit for the
sums actually received by Lender or beyond the reimbursement or payment of the
costs and expenses for which such accounts were established in accordance with
their terms. Upon assignment of the Loan by Lender, any Reserve Funds shall be
turned over to the assignee and any responsibility of Lender as assignor shall
terminate. The requirements of this Agreement concerning Reserve Accounts in no
way supersede, limit or waive any other rights or obligations of the parties
under any of the Loan Documents or under applicable law.

      (i) Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the Reserve
Accounts or the Reserve Funds deposited therein or permit any Lien to attach
thereto, except for the security interest granted in this Section 9.9, or any
levy to be made thereon, or any UCC

                                       87
<PAGE>

Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be
filed with respect thereto.

      (j) Borrower will maintain the security interest created by this Section
9.9 as a first priority perfected security interest and will defend the right,
title and interest of Lender in and to the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve
Funds against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. At any time and
from time to time, upon the written request of Lender, and at the sole expense
of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and duly execute and deliver such further
instruments and documents and will take such further actions as Lender
reasonably may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

      Section 10.1 Cash Management Agreement

      On or prior to the Closing Date, Borrower, Manager, Lender and Agent shall

excess of $200,000 which is not vacated or discharged within one hundred twenty
(120) days;

      (k) if any default occurs under the Subordination Agreement, and such
default continues after the expiration of applicable grace periods, if any,
provided that if Borrower or Operating Lessee shall have commenced to cure such
default and thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same,
Borrower or Operating Lessee shall have such time as it shall require in the
exercise of Borrower's or Operating Lessee's due diligence to cure such default,
it being agreed that no such extension shall be for a period in excess of one

Property;

      (o) there shall occur any default under the Operating Lease, in the
observance or performance of any term, covenant or condition of the Operating

to Lender. In the event Lender has extended the Initial Cure Date as provided
herein, Lender shall on each Scheduled Payment Date, withdraw one-third (1/3) of
the Operating Lease Default Deposit and apply the same towards Debt Service and
such other sums then due under the Loan; or

      (p) if Borrower shall continue to be in default under any other term,
covenant or condition of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents for more
than ten (10) days after notice from Lender in the case of any default which can
be cured by the payment of a sum of money or for thirty (30) days after notice
from Lender in the case of any other default, provided that if such default
cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period and Borrower shall
have commenced to cure such default within such thirty (30) day period and
thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, such thirty
(30) day period shall be extended for so long as it shall require Borrower in

action, without notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect and
enforce its rights against Borrower and in the Properties, including, without
limitation, declaring the Debt to be immediately due and payable, and Lender may
enforce or avail itself of any or all rights or remedies provided

contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

      (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of
the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and

Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have
commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its
rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to the
Properties. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent
and may be pursued independently, singularly, successively, together or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its sole

Securitization including, without limitation, bifurcation of the Loan into two
or more components and/or separate notes and/or creating a senior/subordinate
note structure and/or creating two or more uncross-collateralized loans (which
would, among other things, require the creation of two or more

amendment would (i) change the interest rate, the stated maturity or the
amortization of principal set forth in the Note, except in connection with a
bifurcation of the Loan which may result in varying fixed interest rates and
amortization schedules, but which shall have the same initial weighted average
coupon of the original Note, or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of Borrower,
modify or amend any other material economic term of the Loan, or (iii) in the
reasonable judgment of Borrower, materially increase Borrower's obligations and
liabilities under the Loan Documents;

and expenses of the Rating Agencies) shall be paid by Borrower.

      In the event that Borrower requests any consent or approval hereunder and
the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Documents require the receipt of
written confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to the rating on the
Securities, or, in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents
relating to a Securitization, such a rating confirmation is required in order
for the consent of Lender to be given, Borrower shall pay all of the costs and
expenses of Lender, Lender's servicer and each Rating Agency in connection
therewith, and, if applicable, shall pay any fees imposed by any Rating Agency
as a condition to the delivery of such confirmation.

Securities, Borrower and Borrower Principal will cooperate with the holder of
the Note in updating the Disclosure Document by providing all current
information necessary to keep the Disclosure Document accurate and complete in
all material respects.

      (b) Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a
preliminary and a final offering memorandum or private placement memorandum or

Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as the Losses arise out of or are
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the Reviewed Sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency
"term sheets" or presentations relating to the Properties and/or the Loan) or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact required to be stated in the Reviewed Sections (including any
Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Properties and/or the Loan) or necessary in order to make the statements in the
Reviewed Sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or

the Loan) or in connection with the underwriting of the Loan, including, without
limitation, financial statements of Borrower or Borrower Principal, operating
statements, rent rolls, environmental site assessment reports and property
condition reports with respect to the Properties and (ii) Lender or such Issuer
Group or Investor Group did not have any actual independent knowledge of such
untrue statement or omission. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to
any liability which Borrower may otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification
provided for in Clauses (B) and (C) above shall be effective whether or not an
indemnification certificate described in (A) above is provided and shall be
applicable based on information previously provided by Borrower and

                                       99
<PAGE>

Borrower Principal or their Affiliates if Borrower or Borrower Principal do not
provide the indemnification certificate; provided, however, neither Borrower nor
Borrower Principal shall not be liable to the extent that any such Securities
Liabilities relate solely to errors and omissions which Borrower expressly
identified to Lender and remained uncorrected or with respect to any information
not contained in the Reviewed Sections.

      (c) In connection with filings under the Exchange Act or any information
provided to holders of Securities on an ongoing basis, Borrower agrees to
indemnify (i) Lender, the Issuer Group and the Underwriter Group for Losses to
which Lender, the Issuer Group or the Underwriter Group may become subject
insofar as the Securities Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state in the Provided Information a material
fact required to be stated in the Provided Information in order to make the
statements in the Provided Information, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made not misleading and (ii) reimburse Lender, the Issuer Group
or the Underwriter Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
Lender, the Issuer Group or the Underwriter Group in connection with defending
or investigating the Securities Liabilities provided, however, Borrower shall
not be liable to the extent that any such Securities Liabilities relate solely
to errors and omissions which Borrower expressly identified to Lender and
remained uncorrected or with respect to any information not contained in the
Reviewed Sections or as to which Lender or such Issuer Group or Investor Group
had actual independent knowledge of such untrue statement, error or omission.

      (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 13.5
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this
Section 13.5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have
to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify
causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with
any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
(or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party under this Section 13.5 the indemnifying party shall be responsible for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include
both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal defenses available to
it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to
those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties
shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses
and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such
indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for the
expenses of more than one such separate counsel unless an indemnified

                                       100
<PAGE>

party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available
to it that are different from or additional to those available to another
indemnified party.

      (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 13.5(c)
or Section 13.5(d) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
indemnifiable under Section 13.5(c) or Section 13.5(d), the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) the indemnified party's, Borrower's and Borrower Principal's relative
knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which
claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or
omission; and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the
circumstances. Lender, Borrower and Borrower Principal hereby agree that it
would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro
rata or per capita allocation.

      (f) The liabilities and obligations of Borrower and Lender under this
Section 13.5 shall survive the satisfaction of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

      Section 13.6 Rating Surveillance

      In the event Lender retains the Rating Agencies to provide rating
surveillance services on any certificates issued in a Securitization, such
rating surveillance will be at the expense of Borrower in an amount determined
by Lender in its reasonable discretion prior to the occurrence of a
Securitization and such expense will be paid at the closing of the
Securitization.

                          ARTICLE 14 - INDEMNIFICATIONS

      Section 14.1 General Indemnification

      Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties
from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted
against any Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out of or in
any way relating to any one or more of the following: (a) any accident, injury
to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on or
about the Properties or any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs,
adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (b) any use,
nonuse or condition (other than environmental matters which are governed by
Article 12 hereof) in, on or about the Properties or any part thereof or on the
adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets
or ways; (c) performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
materials or other property

                                       101
<PAGE>

in respect of the Properties or any part thereof; (d) any failure of the
Properties to be in compliance with any applicable Legal Requirements (other
than environmental matters which are governed by Article 12 hereof); (e) any and
all claims and demands whatsoever which may be asserted against Lender by reason
of any alleged obligations or undertakings on its part to perform or discharge
any of the terms, covenants, or agreements contained in any Lease; (f) the
holding or investing of the Reserve Accounts or the performance of the Required
Work, or (g) the payment of any commission, charge or brokerage fee to anyone
which may be payable in connection with the funding of the Loan (collectively,
the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower shall not have
any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such Indemnified
Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Lender or any other Indemnified Party. To the extent that the
undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding
sentence may be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy,
Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy
under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified
Liabilities incurred by Lender.

      Section 14.2 Mortgage and Intangible Tax Indemnification

      Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend, indemnify,
release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Parties
and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way relating to any tax on
the making and/or recording of the Mortgages, the Note or any of the other Loan
Documents, but excluding any income, gains, franchise or other similar taxes
imposed on any Indemnified Party.

      Section 14.3 ERISA Indemnification

      Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend, indemnify,
release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of Losses incurred in
correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited loan, and
in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA that
may be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur, directly or
indirectly, as a result of a default under Section 4.8 or Section 5.18 of this
Agreement.

      Section 14.4 Survival

      The obligations and liabilities of Borrower and Borrower Principal under
this Article 14 shall fully survive indefinitely notwithstanding any
termination, satisfaction, assignment, entry of a judgment of foreclosure,
exercise of any power of sale, or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of
any Mortgage.

                            ARTICLE 15 - EXCULPATION

      Section 15.1 Exculpation

      (a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan Documents,
Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or Borrower
Principal, as applicable, to perform and observe the obligations contained
herein or in the other Loan Documents by any action or proceeding wherein a
money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or Borrower Principal, except
that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, action for specific performance or
other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to enforce and realize
upon this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, and
the interest in the Properties, the Rents and any other collateral given to
Lender created by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and the other Loan
Documents; provided, however, that any judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be enforceable against Borrower or Borrower Principal, as applicable, only
to the extent of Borrower's or Borrower Principal's interest in the Properties,
in the Rents and in any other collateral given to Lender. Lender, by accepting
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, agrees
that it shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Section 15.1, sue for,
seek or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower or Borrower Principal in
any such action or proceeding, under or by reason of or under or in connection
with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents. The
provisions of this Section 15.1 shall not, however, (i) constitute a waiver,
release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or secured by this Agreement,
the Note, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents; (ii) impair the right of
Lender to name Borrower or Borrower Principal as a party defendant in any action
or suit for judicial foreclosure and sale under this Agreement and the
Mortgages; (iii) affect the validity or enforceability of any indemnity
(including, without limitation, those contained in Section 12.6, Section 13.5
and Article 14 of this Agreement), guaranty, master lease or similar instrument
made in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and the other
Loan Documents; (iv) impair the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a
receiver; (v) impair the enforcement of the assignment of leases provisions
contained in the Mortgages; or (vi) impair the right of Lender to obtain a
deficiency judgment or other judgment on the Note against Borrower or Borrower
Principal if necessary to obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to which
Lender would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement; provided however,
Lender shall only enforce such judgment to the extent of the Insurance Proceeds
and/or Awards.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.1 to the contrary,
Borrower and Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to Lender on a joint
and several basis for Losses actually sustained as a result of:

            (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower, Borrower
      Principal or any other Affiliate of Borrower or Borrower Principal in
      connection with the execution and the delivery of this Agreement, the
      Note, the Mortgages, any of the other Loan Documents, or any certificate,
      report, financial statement or other instrument or document prepared by or
      on behalf of Borrower, Operating Lessee or any Affiliate of either of them
      and furnished to Lender at the time of the

                                       103
<PAGE>

      closing of the Loan or during the term of the Loan; provided, however,
      neither Borrower nor Borrower Principal shall have any liability pursuant
      to this Section 15.1(b)(i) to the extent any such certificate, report,
      financial statement or other instrument or document was prepared by or on
      behalf of Operating Lessee or Manager or was prepared by or on behalf of
      Borrower in good faith reliance on such information provided by Operating
      Lessee or Manager;

            (ii) Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of Rents received
      by Borrower after the occurrence of an Event of Default;

            (iii) Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of tenant
      security deposits or Rents collected in advance;

            (iv) the misapplication or the misappropriation of Insurance
      Proceeds or Awards;

            (v) Borrower's failure to pay Taxes, Other Charges (except to the
      extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have been deposited in
      escrow with Lender pursuant to the terms hereof and there exists no
      impediment to Lender's utilization thereof), charges for labor or
      materials or other charges incurred in connection with work performed at
      any Individual Property that can create Liens on any Individual Property
      beyond any applicable notice and cure periods specified herein, but, in
      each case, only to the extent the Properties generated sufficient Net
      Operating Income to pay the same when due;

            (vi) Intentionally Omitted;

            (vii) any act of actual waste or arson by Borrower, any principal,
      Affiliate, member or general partner thereof or by Borrower Principal, any
      principal, Affiliate, member or general partner thereof;

            (viii) a default by Borrower, Borrower Principal or any SPE
      Component Entity (if any) of any of the material covenants set forth in
      Article 6;

            (ix) Borrower's failure during the existence of any Event of Default
      and upon the written request of Lender, to deliver (a) all Rents and (b)
      all books and records relating to the Properties to the extent the same
      are in Borrower's possession and control; or

            (x) the filing by any Person within ten (10) days (or on the next
      Business Day if the 10th day falls on a day the appropriate Court is
      closed) of the entry of an order by the United States Bankruptcy Court
      authorizing and approving the sale of the Properties to Borrower of any
      notice of appeal from or motion for reconsideration of such order.

      (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to pursue
recourse liability as set forth in subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL AND
VOID and shall be of no further force and effect and the Debt shall be fully
recourse to

                                       104
<PAGE>

Borrower and Borrower Principal in the event of (i) a default by Borrower,
Borrower Principal or any SPE Component Entity (if any) of any of the covenants
set forth in Article 7 hereof, or (ii) if the any Individual Property or any
part thereof shall become an asset in (A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of Borrower, or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of Borrower (and Borrower or Borrower Principal has joined with,
colluded in or failed to object to any such involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or
insolvency proceeding) which is not dismissed within ninety (90) days of filing.

      (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which
Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the indebtedness
secured by the Mortgages or to require that all collateral shall continue to
secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender in accordance with this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents.

                         ARTICLE 17 - FURTHER ASSURANCES

      Section 17.1 Replacement Documents

      Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of Lender as to the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of the Note or any other Loan Document which is
not of public record, and, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender
and cancellation of such Note or other Loan Document, Borrower will issue, in
lieu thereof, a replacement Note or other Loan Document, dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or other Loan Document in the same
principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.

      Section 17.2 Recording of Mortgages, Etc.

      Borrower forthwith upon the execution and delivery of the Mortgages and
thereafter, from time to time, will cause the Mortgages and any of the other
Loan Documents creating a Lien or security interest or evidencing the Lien
hereof upon the

                                       106
<PAGE>

Properties and each instrument of further assurance to be filed, registered or
recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by any present or
future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect and perfect the
Lien or security interest hereof upon, and the interest of Lender in, the
Properties. Borrower will pay all taxes, filing, registration or recording fees,
and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgment and/or
recording of the Note, the Mortgages, the other Loan Documents, any note, deed
of trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with respect
to the Properties and any instrument of further assurance, and any modification
or amendment of the foregoing documents, and all federal, state, county and
municipal taxes, duties, imposts, assessments and charges arising out of or in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Mortgages, any deed of trust
or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with respect to the
Properties or any instrument of further assurance, and any modification or
amendment of the foregoing documents, except where prohibited by law so to do.

      Section 17.3 Further Acts, Etc.

      Borrower will, at the cost of Borrower, and without expense to Lender, do,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every further acts, deeds, conveyances,
deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments, security agreements, control agreements,
notices of assignments, transfers and assurances as Lender shall, from time to
time, reasonably require, for the better assuring, conveying, assigning,
transferring, and confirming unto Lender the property and rights hereby
mortgaged, deeded, granted, bargained, sold, conveyed, confirmed, pledged,
assigned, warranted and transferred or intended now or hereafter so to be, or
which Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or assign to
Lender, or for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of the
terms of this Agreement or for filing, registering or recording the Mortgages,
or for complying with all Legal Requirements. Borrower, on demand, will execute
and deliver, and in the event it shall fail to so execute and deliver, hereby
authorizes Lender to execute in the name of Borrower or without the signature of
Borrower to the extent Lender may lawfully do so, one or more financing
statements and financing statement amendments to evidence more effectively,
perfect and maintain the priority of the security interest of Lender in the
Properties. Borrower grants to Lender an irrevocable power of attorney coupled
with an interest for the purpose of exercising and perfecting any and all rights
and remedies available to Lender at law and in equity, including without
limitation, such rights and remedies available to Lender pursuant to this
Section 17.3.

      Section 17.4 Changes in Tax, Debt, Credit and Documentary Stamp Laws

      (a) If any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of this
Agreement which deducts the Debt from the value of any Individual Property for
the purpose of taxation or which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly,
on the Debt or Lender's interest in an Individual Property, Borrower will pay
the tax, with interest and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by
counsel chosen by it that the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or
taxable to Lender or unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury
then Lender shall have the option by written notice of not less

                                       107
<PAGE>

than one hundred twenty (120) days to declare the Debt immediately due and
payable, without prepayment premium or penalty.

      (b) Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit or
credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other Charges
assessed against an Individual Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction
shall otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of an Individual
Property, or any part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by reason of the
Mortgages or the Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by
law, Lender shall have the option, by written notice of not less than one
hundred twenty (120) days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable.

      If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or any
subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to be
affixed to the Note, the Mortgages, or any of the other Loan Documents or impose
any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower will pay for the same, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any.

refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this
Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy

                              ARTICLE 18 - WAIVERS

      Section 18.1 Remedies Cumulative; Waivers

      The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's
rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's
sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power
accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power
or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power
may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A
waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by
Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

      Section 18.2 Modification, Waiver in Writing

      No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement, or of the Note, or of any other Loan Document,
nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against whom
enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall
entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or
other circumstances.

      Section 18.3 Delay Not a Waiver

      Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender in insisting upon
strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement, or exercising
any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note or under any
other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security therefor, shall
operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of any
other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due

                                       109
<PAGE>

of all other amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan
Documents, or to declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any
such other amount.

      Section 18.4 Trial by Jury

      BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT A
TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER
ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS
GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER, AND
IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. EACH OF LENDER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND BORROWER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN
ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND LENDER.

      Section 18.5 Waiver of Notice

      Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

      Section 18.6 Remedies of Borrower

      In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Lender
agrees that, in such event, it shall cooperate in expediting any action seeking
injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.

<PAGE>

      Section 18.7 Cross-Default; Cross-Collateralization; Waiver of Marshalling
of Assets

      (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan to Borrower upon
the security of its collective interest in the Properties and in reliance upon
the aggregate of the Properties taken together being of greater value as
collateral security than the sum of each Individual Property taken separately.
Borrower agrees that the Mortgages are and will be cross collateralized and
cross defaulted with each other so that (i) an Event of Default under any of the
Mortgages shall constitute an Event of Default under each of the other Mortgages
which secure the Note; (ii) an Event of Default under the Note or this Agreement
shall constitute an Event of Default under each Mortgage; (iii) each Mortgage
shall constitute security for the Note as if a single blanket Lien were placed
on all of the Properties as security for the Note; and (iv) such cross
collateralization shall in no event be deemed to constitute a fraudulent
conveyance.

      (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Properties, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Properties for the collection of the Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of an Individual Property in
preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition, Borrower, for itself
and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of any or all
of the Mortgages, any equitable right otherwise available to Borrower which
would require the separate sale of the Properties or require Lender to exhaust
its remedies against any Individual Property or any combination of the
Properties before proceeding against any other Individual Property or
combination of Properties; and further in the event of such foreclosure Borrower
does hereby expressly consents to and authorizes, at the option of Lender, the
foreclosure and sale either separately or together of any combination of the
Properties.

      Section 18.8 Waiver of Statute of Limitations

      Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to
payment of the Debt or performance of its Other Obligations.

      Section 18.9 Waiver of Counterclaim

      Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

                           ARTICLE 19 - GOVERNING LAW

      Section 19.1 Choice of Law

      This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract entered into pursuant to
the laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed,
construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, provided however, (a) that with respect to the creation, perfection,
priority and enforcement of any Lien created by the Loan Documents, and the
determination of deficiency judgments, the laws of the state where the
applicable Individual Property is located shall apply, and (b) with respect to
the security interest in each of the Reserve Accounts and the Lockbox Account,
the laws of the state where each such account is located shall apply.

      Section 19.2 Severability

      Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted
in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any
provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable
law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

      Section 19.3 Preferences

      Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse
and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion of the obligations
of Borrower hereunder. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or payments to
Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to
be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Creditors Rights
Laws, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent
of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or part thereof
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect,
as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Lender.

                           ARTICLE 20 - MISCELLANEOUS

      Section 20.1 Survival

      This Agreement and all covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made herein and in the certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the making by Lender of the Loan and the execution and delivery to
Lender of the Note, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as all
or any of the Debt is outstanding and unpaid unless a longer period is expressly
set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Whenever in this Agreement any
of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include
the legal representatives, successors and assigns of such party. All covenants,
promises and agreements in this Agreement, by or on behalf of Borrower, shall
inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of
Lender.

      Whenever pursuant to this Agreement, Lender exercises any right given to
it to approve or disapprove, or any arrangement or term is to be satisfactory to

with any appellate proceeding or post-judgment action involved therein, together
with all required service or use taxes.

      Section 20.5 Schedules Incorporated

may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated
counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any
action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any
such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or
defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender.

<PAGE>

tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor to grant Lender any
interest in the Properties other than that of mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

      (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the benefit
of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and Borrower
an right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of any of
the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the obligations
of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the
benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to require
satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be entitled to
assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of strict
compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any

which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

      (c) The general partners, members, principals and (if Borrower is a trust)
beneficial owners of Borrower are experienced in the ownership and operation of

operation of the Properties. Borrower is not relying on Lender's expertise,
business acumen or advice in connection with the Properties.

or fulfilled or to be given to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the Mortgages,
the Note or the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any
officer's certificate, balance sheet, statement of profit and loss or other
financial statement, survey, appraisal, or insurance policy, Lender shall not be
deemed to have warranted, consented to, or affirmed the sufficiency, the
legality or effectiveness of same, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall
not constitute any warranty or affirmation with respect thereto by Lender.

      (f) Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that in accepting this Agreement,
the Note, the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, Lender is expressly and
primarily relying on the truth and accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement without any obligation to
investigate the Properties and notwithstanding any investigation of the
Properties by Lender; that such reliance existed on the part of Lender prior to
the date hereof, that the warranties and representations are a material
inducement to Lender in making the Loan; and that Lender would not be willing to
make the Loan and accept this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgages and the other
Loan Documents in the absence of the warranties and representations as set forth
in Article 4 of this Agreement.

whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it under any
