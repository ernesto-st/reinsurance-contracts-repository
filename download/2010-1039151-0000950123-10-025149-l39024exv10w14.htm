Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the
Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender&#146;s
Applicable Percentage of the aggregate Dollar Amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank,
such Lender&#146;s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e)&nbsp;of this Section, or of any

Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative
Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date the
Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if the Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole
discretion by notice to the Borrower, in such other Agreed Currency which was paid by the Issuing
Bank pursuant to such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than
12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have
received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00&nbsp;a.m., Local Time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than
12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
<U>provided</U> that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent Dollar Amount of such LC Disbursement and, to the
extent so financed, the Borrower&#146;s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced
by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such
payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender&#146;s
Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to
the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in
the same manner as provided in Section&nbsp;2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.07 shall apply, <U>mutatis</U> <U>mutandis</U>, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and
the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from
the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may
appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for
any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as
contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Borrower&#146;s reimbursement of, or obligation to

whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of
this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against,
the Borrower&#146;s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the
Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by
reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or
failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the
preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or
delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit
(including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
<U>provided</U> that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from
liability to the Borrower to the extent of or constitute a waiver by the Borrower of any claim for
any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are
caused by the Issuing Bank&#146;s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto
expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall
be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and
without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such
documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information
to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not

telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made
or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; <U>provided</U> that any failure to give or delay in

shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the

using the applicable Exchange Rate on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered
to the Borrower. The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and
to the extent required by Section&nbsp;2.11(b). Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent
as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. The Administrative Agent
shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
account and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent a security interest in the LC
Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which
investments shall be made in Cash Equivalents at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the Borrower&#146;s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.

Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the

and punctual payment of such Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in
part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee
hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Guaranteed Obligation.

by (a)&nbsp;the failure of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to assert any claim
or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b)&nbsp;any extension or renewal of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (c)&nbsp;any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from,
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d)&nbsp;any
default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (e)&nbsp;the failure of the Administrative Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain
any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the
Guaranteed Obligations (including, without limitation, the Collateral), if any; (f)&nbsp;any change in

guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise
affecting any term of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (h)&nbsp;any other act, omission or delay to
do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Party
or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would
impair or eliminate any right of such Loan Party to subrogation.

Person.

is responsible for the release of volatile organic compounds. Northrop Grumman, under the
direction of the Regional Water Quality Control Board (&#147;RWQCB&#148;), has been in the process of
remediating the contamination since 1992. The RWQCB has provided in writing that they will not
look to future owners of the site for remedial requirements. Further, the lease agreement between
the Company and the current owner of the site includes an indemnification provision with respect to
this environmental matter.
