WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrower  consisting of the Term Loan in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000.

The Lenders are severally, and not  jointly, willing to extend such credit to the Borrower, subject to the terms and conditions  hereinafter set forth.  THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:  1. ACCOUNTING AND OTHER TERMS (a) Accounting terms not defined in this Agreement shall be construed in conformity with GAAP.  Subject to Section 1(c), calculations and determinations of accounting  terms must be made in conformity with GAAP.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this  Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in Section 13.    (b) For purposes of the Loan Documents, whenever a representation or warranty is made to the knowledge or awareness of the Borrower or any Responsible Officer of  the Borrower, to the &#8220;best of&#8221; the knowledge of the Borrower or any Responsible Officer of the  Borrower or with a similar qualification, it will be deemed to mean the actual knowledge, after  reasonable inquiry, of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower.  (c) If any change in GAAP occurs after the Effective Date by the promulgation of rules, regulations, pronouncements and opinions by, or otherwise as required by, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (or any  successor thereto or agencies with similar functions), or if any change in the application of GAAP  by White Mountains, the Borrower or their respective Subsidiaries occurs after the Effective Date,  in each case, which results in a change in the calculation of financial covenants, standards or terms  (including all applicable covenants, representations and warranties) contained in this Agreement  or any other Loan Document, the parties hereto agree to enter, promptly upon request therefor by  the Borrower or the Agent, into negotiations to amend such provisions so as equitably to reflect  such changes to the end that the criteria for evaluating financial and other covenants, financial  condition and performance will be the same after such changes as they were before such changes;  and pending the effectiveness of such amendment, the Borrower shall continue to provide  calculations for all financial covenants, perform all financial covenants and otherwise observe all  financial standards and terms (including all applicable covenants, representations and warranties)  in the Loan Documents in accordance with GAAP, or with the application thereof, as in effect  immediately prior to such changes.  </FONT></DIV>

Subject to Sections 2.3(b) and 2.10, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan shall bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR for the Interest Period  then in effect plus the Applicable Margin.  Accrued interest on the Term Loan shall be payable in  arrears at the end of each Interest Period; provided that in the event of any repayment or  prepayment of the Term Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be  payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment.  (b) Default Rate.  If any principal of or interest on the Term Loan or any Applicable Prepayment Premium payable hereunder is not, in each case, paid when due, whether  at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, the relevant overdue amount shall bear interest,  in accordance with the immediately following sentence, to the fullest extent permitted by  applicable Requirements of Law, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum (the  &#8220;Default Rate&#8221;) equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of the Term Loan, 2.0% per annum  plus the rate otherwise applicable to the Term Loan as provided in Section 2.3(a) or (ii) in the case  of any overdue interest or Applicable Prepayment Premium, 2.0% per annum plus the rate then  applicable to the Term Loan as provided in Section 2.3(a).  Interest at the Default Rate shall accrue  from the date on which an Event of Default for such failure to pay when due shall have occurred  and until such Event of Default is cured or waived and shall be payable upon demand.  Payment  or acceptance of the Default Rate is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not  constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies  of the Agent or the Lenders.  (c) Usury.  It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Agent and each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it.  Accordingly, if the transactions  contemplated hereby or by any other Loan Document would be usurious as to the Agent or any  Lender under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United States of America and the  State of New York or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily applicable to the  Agent or such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement), then, in that event,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any  agreement entered into in connection with or as security for the Obligations, it is agreed as follows:  the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to the Agent or  any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by the Agent or such Lender  under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreements or otherwise in connection with  the Obligations shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such  applicable law, any excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be credited  by the Agent or such Lender on the principal amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the  principal amount of the Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by  the Agent or such Lender, as applicable, to the Borrower).  If at any time and from time to time  (x) the amount of interest payable to the Agent or any Lender on any date shall be computed at the highest lawful rate applicable to the Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) and (y) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to the Agent or such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to the Agent or such Lender computed at the highest lawful rate applicable to the Agent or such Lender, then the amount of interest payable to the Agent or such Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the highest lawful rate applicable to the Agent or such </FONT></DIV>

(c) Fees Fully Earned.

(b) Payments of principal and/or interest received after 3:00 p.m., New York City time, are considered received at the opening of business on the next Business Day.  When a  payment is due on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment shall be due the next Business  Day, and additional interest, if applicable, shall continue to accrue until paid.  </FONT></DIV>

(a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the  Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for  any Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Requirements of Law.  If at any time any  Requirements of Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding  agent) requires the withholding or deduction for any Taxes from any such payment by a  withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction  or withholding and shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental  Authority in accordance with the applicable Requirements of Law and, if such Tax is an  Indemnified Tax, the Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that the amount due from the  Borrower with respect to such payment hereunder will be increased to the extent necessary to  ensure that, after the making of such required withholding or deduction for Indemnified Taxes, the  applicable Secured Party receives a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no  withholding or deduction for Indemnified Taxes been made.

In addition, each Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall  deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably  requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine  whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting  requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the  completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set  forth in Section 2.6(d)(ii)) shall not be required if in the applicable Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment  such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material  unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of  such Lender.

The powers conferred on the Agent  under this Section 4 are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty  upon it to exercise any such powers.  Except with respect to the exercise of reasonable care in the  custody of any Collateral in its possession, the Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as  to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights  pertaining to any Collateral.  The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the  custody and preservation of Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment  substantially equal to that which the Agent accords its own property.  The Agent shall not be liable  for failure to demand, collect or realize upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any delay in  doing so, and the Agent shall not have an obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral  upon the request of the Borrower or otherwise.  4.6 Certain Covenants as to the Collateral.

Upon consummation of any such sale of any Collateral  pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 4.7, the Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer  and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold.  Each such purchaser at  any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of  the Borrower, and the Borrower hereby waives and releases (to the extent permitted by law) all  rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal that the Borrower now has or may at any time  in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.   Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, any exercise of  rights or remedies by the Agent shall be subject to applicable Requirements of Law, including (if  applicable) the express written approval of any Applicable Insurance Regulatory Authority.  4.8 Sale Process.  The Agent shall give the Borrower ten (10) Business Days&#8217; written  notice (which the Borrower agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the  Code or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Agent&#8217;s intention to make any sale of Collateral  pursuant to Section 4.7.  Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for  such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker&#8217;s board or on a securities exchange, shall state the  board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion  thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange.  Any such public sale shall be held  at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Agent may  fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale.  At any such sale, the Collateral, or the portion  thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Agent may (in  its sole and absolute discretion) determine.  The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of  any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such  Collateral shall have been given.  The Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public  or private auction pursuant to Section 4.7 or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by  announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be  made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  In the case of any sale of all or  any part of the Collateral pursuant to Section 4.7 made on credit or for future delivery, the  Collateral so sold may be retained by the Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or  purchasers thereof, but the Agent shall not incur any liability in the event that any such purchaser  or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in the case of any such  failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon notice given in accordance with provisions above.   At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to Section 4.7, the  Agent may bid for or purchase for cash, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of  redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of the Borrower (all such rights being also  hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof  offered for sale, and the Agent may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and  dispose of such property without further accountability to the Borrower therefor.  For purposes of  this Section 4.8, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be  treated as a sale thereof; the Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement  and the Borrower shall not be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject  thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all  </FONT></DIV>

The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Agent as its  lawful attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full authority in the place and stead of the Borrower and in  the name of the Borrower or otherwise, from time to time in the Agent&#8217;s discretion, exercisable  only upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to take any action  and to execute any instrument that the Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the  purposes of this Agreement, including but not limited to:  (a) endorse the Borrower&#8217;s name on any  checks or other forms of payment or security; (b) pay, contest or settle any Lien and adverse claim  in or to the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise take any action to terminate or  discharge the same; and (c) transfer the Collateral into the name of the Agent or a third party as  the Code permits.

The Agent&#8217;s foregoing appointments as the Borrower&#8217;s  attorney in fact, and all of the Agent&#8217;s rights and powers, coupled with an interest, are irrevocable  until all the Term Loan Commitments shall have terminated and all Obligations (other than  Unasserted Contingent Claims) shall have been fully repaid and performed, but shall automatically  cease to be in effect thereafter.  9.3 Protective Payments.  If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries fails to obtain the  insurance required by Section 6.4 or fails to pay any premium thereon or fails to pay any other  amount which the Borrower is obligated to pay under this Agreement or any other Loan Document  or which may be required to preserve the Collateral, the Agent may obtain such insurance or make  such payment, and all amounts so paid by the Agent shall be Obligations and shall be secured by  the Collateral.  The Agent shall provide the Borrower with notice of the Agent obtaining such  insurance at the time it is obtained or within a reasonable time thereafter.  No such payments by  the Agent are deemed an agreement to make similar payments in the future or a Secured Party&#8217;s  waiver of any Event of Default.  9.4 Application of Payments and Proceeds upon Default.

The Agent shall pay any surplus to the Borrower or to other Persons legally entitled thereto; the  Borrower shall remain liable to the Secured Parties for any deficiency.

Subject to the foregoing,  the Borrower bears all risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Collateral.  9.6 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.  The Agent&#8217;s failure, at any time or times, to  require strict performance by the Borrower of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan  Document shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of any Secured Party thereafter to demand  strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith.  The Secured Parties&#8217; rights and  remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative.  The Secured  Parties have all rights and remedies provided under the Code, by law, or in equity.  A Secured  Party&#8217;s exercise of one right or remedy is not an election and shall not preclude any Secured Party  from exercising any other remedy under this Agreement or other remedy available at law or in  equity.  Any Secured Party&#8217;s delay in exercising any remedy is not a waiver, election, or  acquiescence.  9.7 Demand Waiver.  The Borrower waives demand, notice of default or dishonor,  notice of payment and nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity, release,  compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments, chattel paper,  and guarantees held by the Agent on which the Borrower is liable, in each case, in connection with  any exercise of remedies hereunder and except for any notice by the Agent or any Lender that is  expressly required or contemplated to be given to the Borrower under this Agreement or any other  Loan Document.  10.

The Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those  expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents.  The duties of the Agent  shall be mechanical and administrative in nature.  The Agent shall not have by reason of this  Agreement or any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender.  Nothing  in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, express or implied, is intended to or shall be  construed to impose upon the Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other  Loan Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.  Each Lender shall make its own  independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries  in connection with the making and the continuance of the Term Loan hereunder and shall make its  own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the value of the  Collateral, and the Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing  basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether  coming into its possession before the Effective Date or at any time or times thereafter; provided  that, upon the reasonable request of a Lender, the Agent shall provide to such Lender any  documents or reports delivered to the Agent by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement or any other Loan Document.  If the Agent seeks the consent or approval of the Lenders  to the taking or refraining from taking any action hereunder, the Agent shall send notice thereof to  each Lender.  14.3 Rights, Exculpation, Etc.  The Agent and its directors, officers, agents or  employees shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them under or in  connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for their own gross  negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent (i) may treat the payee of  the Term Loan as the owner thereof until the Agent receives written notice of the assignment or  transfer thereof, pursuant to Section 12.2, signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the  Agent; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Agent or  counsel to the Borrower), independent public accountants, and other experts selected by the Agent  and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by any of them in  accordance with the advice of such counsel or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation  to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, certificates, warranties  or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents;  (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any  of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on the part  of any Person, the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default, or to inspect  the Collateral or other property (including, without limitation, the books and records) of any  Person; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity,  enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents  or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (vi) shall not be  deemed to have made any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or  collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Agent&#8217;s Lien thereon, or  any certificate prepared by the Borrower in connection therewith, nor shall the Agent be  </FONT></DIV>

The Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made  by it in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, and if any such apportionment or distribution is  subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender to whom  payment was due but not made shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of  the amount which they are determined to be entitled.  The Agent may at any time request  instructions from the Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this  Agreement or of any of the other Loan Documents the Agent is permitted or required to take or to  grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, the Agent shall be absolutely entitled to  refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval under any of the Loan Documents until  it shall have received such instructions from the Lenders.  14.4 Reliance.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any written notices, statements,  certificates, orders or other documents or any telephone message believed by it in good faith to be  genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect  to all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and its duties  hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.  14.5 Indemnification.  To the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed and indemnified  by the Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Agent from and against any and  all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses,  advances or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred  by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of  the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement or  any of the other Loan Documents, in proportion to each Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share; provided,  however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,  damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or disbursements for  which there has been a final judicial determination that such liability resulted from the Agent&#8217;s  gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 14.5  shall survive the payment in full of the Term Loan and any other Obligation under this Agreement  and the cancellation of this Agreement.  14.6 Agent Individually.  With respect to its Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan  Commitment hereunder and the Term Loan made by it, the Agent shall have and may exercise the  same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities as and to  the extent set forth herein for any other Lender.  The term &#8220;Lenders&#8221; or any similar term shall,  unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity as a  Lender (as applicable).  The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and  generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries as if it were not acting as the Agent pursuant hereto without any duty to account to  the other Lenders.  14.7 Collateral Matters.  The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent to release  any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon any Collateral upon all the Term Loan Commitments  having been terminated and all the Obligations (other than Unasserted Contingent Claims) having  been paid in full in cash.

Each Lender hereby appoints the Agent and each other  Lender as agent and bailee for the purpose of perfecting or establishing the priority of the security  interests in and liens upon the Collateral in assets which, in accordance with applicable  Requirements of Law, can be perfected only by possession or control (or where the security interest  of a secured party with possession or control has priority over the security interest of another  secured party) and the Agent and each Lender hereby acknowledges that it holds possession of or  otherwise controls any such Collateral for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders as secured  party.  Should any Lender obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall  notify the Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Agent&#8217;s request therefor shall deliver such  Collateral to the Agent or in accordance with the Agent&#8217;s instructions.  The Borrower by its  execution and delivery of this Agreement hereby consents to the foregoing.  14.9 No Reliance on Agent&#8217;s Customer Identification Program.  Each Lender  acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or  assignees, may rely on the Agent to carry out such Lender&#8217;s, Affiliate&#8217;s, participant&#8217;s or assignee&#8217;s  customer identification program, or other requirements imposed by the USA PATRIOT Act or the  regulations issued thereunder, including the regulations set forth in 31 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 1010.100(yy),  (iii), 1020.100, and 1020.220 (formerly 31 C.F.R. &sect; 103.121), as hereafter amended or replaced  (&#8220;CIP Regulations&#8221;), or any other anti-terrorism Requirements of Law, including any programs  involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with the Borrower, its Affiliates  or their agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby:  (a) any  identity verification procedures, (b) any recordkeeping, (c) comparisons with government lists,  (d) customer notices or (e) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or other  regulations issued under the USA PATRIOT Act.  Each Lender, Affiliate, participant or assignee  subject to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act will perform the measures necessary to satisfy  its own responsibilities under the CIP Regulations.  14.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries.  The provisions of this Article (other than Section  14.7, which shall also be for the benefit of the Borrower) are solely for the benefit of the Secured  Parties, and neither the Borrower nor its Subsidiaries shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary  of any of such provisions.  14.11 No Fiduciary Relationship.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term  &#8220;agent&#8221; herein or in any other Loan Document (or any other similar term) with reference to the  Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising  under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead such term is used as a matter of market  custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting  parties.  14.12 Reports; Confidentiality; Disclaimers.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any  Event of Default, the Agent or its designee may at any time and from time to time employ and  maintain on the premises of the Borrower a custodian selected by the Agent or its designee who  shall have full authority to do all acts necessary to protect the Agent&#8217;s and the Lenders&#8217; interests.  The Borrower hereby agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with any such custodian  and to do whatever the Agent or its designee may reasonably request to preserve the Collateral.  All costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or its designee by reason of the employment of the  custodian shall be the responsibility of the Borrower and shall be Obligations.  14.14 Agent May File Proofs of Claim.
