to be made on such date, in Dollars and in immediately available funds and (ii)

made available by the Banks on such day at its Payment Office.

            Section 2.05 Notes. The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal
of, and interest on, the Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced by a
promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the
form of Exhibit B with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith
(each a "Note" and, collectively, the "Notes"). Each Note shall (i) be payable

a party hereto on the Effective Date or the effective date of the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a party hereto if such Bank
shall become a party hereto after the Effective Date, (ii) be in a stated
principal amount equal to such Bank's Commitment and be payable in the principal
amount of the Loans evidenced thereby, (iii) mature, with respect to each Loan
evidenced thereby, on the Expiry Date, (iv) bear interest as provided in the
appropriate clause of Section 2.06 in respect of the Loans evidenced thereby and
(v) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and be secured by the Security

<PAGE>
its internal records the amount of each Loan made by it and each payment in
respect thereof and will prior to any transfer of its Note endorse on the
reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced
thereby. Failure to make any such notation shall not affect the Borrower's
obligations in respect of such Loans.

            Section 2.06 Interest. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in
respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Loan from the date the proceeds
thereof are made available to the Borrower until the maturity thereof (whether
by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall be equal to the
Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin.

            (b) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest in respect of each Loan and any other overdue amount payable by the
Borrower hereunder shall bear interest from the date payment thereof was due
until (but not including) the date of actual payment at a rate per annum equal
to 4.0% per annum in excess of the Base Rate in effect from time to time.

            (c) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i)
in respect of each Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
March, June, September and December, and (ii) in respect of each Loan, on any
prepayment (on the amount prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

            Section 2.07 Capital Adequacy. If any Bank determines at any time
that any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order or request
(whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any
change in interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank based
on the existence of its Commitment hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then
the Borrower shall pay to such Bank, upon its written demand therefor, such
additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Bank for the
increased cost to such Bank as a result of such increase of capital. In
determining such additional amounts, such Bank will act reasonably and in good
faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable,
provided that such Bank's determination of compensation owing under this Section
2.07 shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all
the parties hereto. Each Bank, upon determining that any additional amounts will
be payable pursuant to this Section 2.07, will give prompt written notice
thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show the basis for the calculation
of such additional amounts. The failure to give any such notice shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any of the Borrower's obligations to pay additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.07, provided that the Borrower shall not be
required to pay any such amounts until it receives written notice from a Bank in
accordance with this Section 2.07.

extended by one calendar year. Such Extension Request (a copy of which shall be
forwarded by the Agent to each of the Banks) shall include a certification by a
senior officer of the Borrower that no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and all representations and warranties contained herein and
the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all material aspects on and
as of the date of the Extension Request (it being understood and agreed that any
representation or warranty which expressly refers by its terms to a specified
date shall be required to be true only as of such date). If by the date
occurring 30 days next succeeding the Agent's receipt of such Extension Request,
any Bank agrees thereto in writing by so indicating on counterparts of the
Extension Request and delivering such counterpart to the Borrower, "Expiry Date"
as to such Bank shall mean the February 27 occurring in the calendar year next
succeeding the Expiry Date then in effect, provided that any failure to so
notify the Borrower shall be deemed to be a disapproval by such Bank of the
Borrower's Extension Request. The Commitment of any Bank which does not so
agree, shall terminate upon the Expiry Date then in effect. No Bank shall be
obligated to grant any extension pursuant to this Section 3.04(a), and any such
extension shall be in the sole discretion of each Bank. The Borrower shall pay
to each Bank which does not so agree all amounts owing under its Note and this
Agreement on the effective date of the termination of such Bank's Commitment.

            (b) If fewer than all of the Banks consent to an Extension Request
(each Bank that has not so consented being a "Declining Bank", and each other
Bank being an "Extending Bank"), the Borrower shall have the right to require
any Declining Bank to assign in full its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (i) to any one or more Extending Banks designated by the Borrower that
have offered in their returned counterpart of the Extension Request to increase
their respective Commitments in an aggregate amount at least equal to the amount
of such Declining Bank's Commitment (each such Extending Bank being an
"Increasing Extending Bank") and (ii) to the extent of any shortfall in the
aggregate amount of extended Commitments to any one or more Eligible Transferees
designated by the Borrower that agree to assume all of such rights and
obligations (each such Eligible Transferee being a "Replacement Bank"), provided
that (1) such Declining Bank shall have received payment of all amounts owing
under its Note and this Agreement on the effective date of such assignment, (2)
such assignment shall otherwise have occurred in compliance with Section 12.04
including, without limitation, clauses (iii) and (iv) of subsection (b) thereof
and (3) the effective date of such assignment shall be the


                                      -14-
<PAGE>
date specified by the Borrower and agreed to by the Replacement Bank or
Increasing Extending Bank, as the case may be, which date shall be on or prior
to the applicable Expiry Date.

SECTION 4. PREPAYMENTS; PAYMENTS.

            Section 4.01 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
right to prepay the Loans, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part from
time to time, provided that the Borrower shall give the Agent at its Notice
Office at least three Business Days' prior notice of its intent to prepay the
Loans.

            Section 4.02 Mandatory Prepayments. On each Pledged Reserve
Repayment Date, an amount equal to 100% of the Pledged Reserves Account Funds
with respect to which the Borrower has delivered a Pledged Reserve Release
Notice as required by Section 8.11 shall be applied as a mandatory prepayment of
principal of outstanding Loans.

            Section 4.03 Method and Place of Payment. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement or any Note
shall be made to the Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date
when due and shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds at the
Agent's Payment Office. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under the
Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due
date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with
respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable
rate during such extension.

            Section 4.04 Net Payments. All payments made by the Borrower
hereunder or under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other
defense. All such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any
jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein with respect to such payment (but excluding any tax imposed on or
measured by the net income or gross income or gross receipts of any Bank (other
than withholding taxes or taxes in lieu of withholding taxes) pursuant to the
laws of the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein) in which the principal office or lending office of such Bank
is located or in which such Bank is organized or in which such Bank is doing
business through a branch or office from which such jurisdiction treats a Loan
as having been made) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with
respect thereto (collectively, "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed,
the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes and such additional
amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due hereunder
or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any
Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. The
Borrower shall also reimburse each Bank, upon its written request, which request
shall show the basis for calculation of such reimbursement, for taxes imposed on
or measured by the net income of such Bank pursuant to the laws of the
jurisdiction (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein) in which its principal office or lending office is located or in which
such Bank is organized or in which such Bank is doing business through a branch
or office from which such jurisdiction treats a Loan as having


                                      -15-
<PAGE>
been made as it shall determine are payable by it in respect of amounts paid to
or on behalf of such Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Borrower will
furnish to the applicable Bank within 45 days after the date the payment of any
Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of any tax receipts
available to the Borrower evidencing such payment by the Borrower. The Borrower
will indemnify and hold harmless each Bank, and reimburse each Bank upon its
written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by
such Bank.

            Section 4.05 Limitations on Sources of Payment. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or of any other Credit Document, the
obligations of the Borrower to make payments of principal and interest on the
Loans and the Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Borrower payable
solely from the Pledged Recoveries, the Pledged Premiums, the Pledged Reserves
Account Funds and the other Collateral, and none of the Agent, the Collateral
Agent, any Bank or any other Person shall be entitled to procure any money
judgment against or to levy or foreclose upon or attach any other assets or
properties of the Borrower for payment of such obligations; provided, however,
that nothing herein contained shall limit, restrict or impair the lien created
by the Security Agreement or the right of any Bank to exercise any of its rights
herein or in any of the other Credit Documents upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default or otherwise, or to bring suit and obtain a judgment against the
Borrower (recourse thereon being limited as to payment of principal and interest
on the Loans and the Notes as provided in this Section 4.05).

            In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement, the
Borrower makes the following representations, warranties and agreements as of

<PAGE>
effect on the business, operations, property, assets, liabilities, prospects or

corporate power to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each
of the Credit Documents to which it is party and has taken all necessary
corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of

Documents other than this Agreement, by the Effective Date will have, duly
executed and delivered each of the Credit Documents to which it is party, and
each of such Credit Documents constitutes or, in the case of each such other
Credit Document when executed and delivered, will constitute, its legal, valid
and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the
qualifications that enforcement of the rights and remedies created hereby or
thereby is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

            Section 7.03 No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance by the Borrower of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, nor
compliance by it with the terms and provisions thereof, nor the use of the

rule or regulation or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or

indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit agreement, loan agreement or any
other agreement, contract or instrument to which the Borrower is a party or by

heretofore furnished to the Banks, present fairly the financial condition of the
Borrower at December 31, 1999, and the results of the operations of the Borrower
for the fiscal year ended on such date. All such financial statements have been
prepared in accordance


                                      -19-
<PAGE>
with generally accepted accounting principles and practices consistently applied

except as may be set forth in any unaudited quarterly financial statements
prepared by the Borrower since the date of the audited financial statements or
in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A filed by Enhance with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (all of which have heretofore been furnished to the Banks).

            (b) Except as fully reflected in the financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 7.05(a), there are no liabilities or obligations with
respect to the Borrower of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in
aggregate, would be material to the Borrower. The Borrower does not know of any
basis for the assertion against the Borrower of any liability or obligation of
any nature whatsoever that is not fully reflected in the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 7.05(a) which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would be material to the Borrower. At December 31, 2000, Average
Annual Debt Service was $591,495,481.

the Borrower in writing to the Banks (including without limitation all
information contained in the Credit Documents) for purposes of or in connection
with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein is, and all other
such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf
of the Borrower in writing to the Banks will be, true and accurate in all
material respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified
and not incomplete by omitting to state any fact necessary to make such
information (taken as a whole) not misleading at such time in light of the
circumstances under which such information was provided.

            Section 7.08 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. All proceeds of
each Loan shall be used by the Borrower only to establish and/or maintain
Permitted Reserves in the Pledged Reserves Account and/or to pay or reimburse
itself for the payment of Losses in respect of the Covered Portfolio, and no
part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used by the Borrower to purchase or
carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. Neither the making of any Loan nor the
use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent with the provisions
of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

            Section 7.09 Tax Returns and Payments. The Borrower has filed all
tax returns required to be filed by it and has paid all income taxes payable by
it which have become due pursuant to such tax returns and all other taxes and
assessments payable by it which have become


                                      -20-
<PAGE>
due, other than those not yet delinquent and except for those contested in good
faith and for which adequate reserves have been established. The Borrower has
paid, or has provided adequate reserves (in the good faith judgment of the
management of the Borrower) for the payment of, all federal and state income

502(i), 515, 4201, 4204, 4212, 4062, 4063, 4064 or 4069 of ERISA or Section
401(a)(29), 4971 or 4975 of the Code which has not been satisfied in full or
expects to incur any material liability under any of the foregoing sections with
respect to any such Plan or Multiemployer Plan; no condition exists which
presents a material risk to the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a
material liability to or on account of a Plan pursuant to the foregoing

employees or other former employees (other than as required by Section 601 of

ERISA) the obligations with respect to which would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Borrower to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

capital stock of the Borrower consists of 100,000 shares of common stock,
$150.00 par value per share, all of which are issued and outstanding. All such

non-assessable. The Borrower does not have outstanding any securities

Obligations in the Covered Portfolio are insured or reinsured by the Borrower
under Insurance Contracts in the form or forms heretofore supplied to the Agent

Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as specified herein
and in the other Credit Documents. Each Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes, and
each holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed

provisions of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any other
instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such
powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically
delegated to or required of the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent may perform any of
its duties hereunder by or through its officers, directors, agents or employees.

or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Security Agreement. Neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors, agents
or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them

therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The duties of the Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the
Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Credit Document a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Bank or the holder of any Note; and
nothing in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, expressed or implied, is
intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Agent any obligations
in respect of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except as expressly
set forth herein or therein.

            Section 11.03 Lack of Reliance on the Agent. Independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, each Bank and the holder of each Note, to the
extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower
in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the taking or
not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of
the creditworthiness of the Borrower and, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially
or on a continuing basis, to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the
making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The Agent shall not be
responsible to any Bank or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements,
information, representations or warranties herein or in any document,
certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the
execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection,
collectability, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit

inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the
financial condition of the Borrower or the existence or possible existence of
any Default or Event of Default.

request instructions from the Banks with respect to any act or action (including
failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
the Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action
unless and until the Agent shall have received instructions from the Majority
Banks or all the Banks to the extent required by Section 12.11; and the Agent
shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without
limiting the foregoing, no Bank or the holder of any Note shall have any right
of action whatsoever against the Agent as a result of the Agent acting or
refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Credit Document in
accordance with the instructions of the Majority Banks or the Banks, as the case
may be.

            Section 11.05 Reliance. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice,
statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram,
radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by
any Person that the Agent believed to be the proper Person, and, with respect to
all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Credit Document and
its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by the
Agent.

disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted
against or incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder or under any
other Credit Document, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document; provided that no Bank shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            Section 11.07 The Agent in Its Individual Capacity. With respect to
its obligation to make Loans under this Agreement, the Agent shall have the
rights and powers specified herein for a "Bank" and may exercise the same rights
and powers as though it was not performing the duties specified herein; and the
term "Banks," "holders of Notes" or any similar terms shall, unless the context
clearly otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The
Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind
of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower or any Affiliate of the
Borrower as if they were not performing the duties specified herein, and may
accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection
with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Banks.

from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and/or under the
other Credit Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written
notice to the Borrower and the Banks. In the case of the resignation by the

            (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by the Agent, the Banks
shall appoint a successor Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Borrower (it being
understood and agreed that any Bank is deemed to be acceptable to the Borrower).

            (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed within
such 15 Business Day period, the Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, shall
then appoint a successor Agent who shall serve as Agent hereunder or thereunder
until such time, if any, as the Banks appoint a successor Agent as provided
above.

            (d) If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to Section
11.08(b) or 11.08(c) by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice of
resignation was given by the Agent, the Agent may appoint any other Bank which
agrees to such appointment to act as successor Agent.

            Section 12.02 Right of Setoff. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 4.05, in addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights and
to the extent permitted by applicable law, during the continuance of an Event of
Default, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to the Borrower
or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set
off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special), and
any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Bank (including without
limitation by branches and agencies of such Bank wherever located) to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower against and on account of the Obligations
and liabilities of the Borrower to such Bank under this Agreement or under any
of the other Credit Documents, and all other claims of any nature or description
arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
irrespective of whether or not the Bank shall have made any demand hereunder and
although said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be
contingent or unmatured, provided however that (i) except to the extent provided
in the next succeeding clause (ii), no Bank is authorized hereunder to take any
of the foregoing actions, nor shall any Bank exercise any other right of setoff
or bankers' lien or any other right now or hereafter granted under applicable
law with respect to the Pledged Reserves Account or any portion of the Pledged
Reserves Account Funds or any Collateral contained in the Pledged Reserves
Account (each of the Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Bank hereby waiving,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such right) and (ii) from and
after receipt by the Agent or the Collateral Agent of any Pledged Reserve
Release Notice, the Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Bank is authorized to and
may exercise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any of such foregoing
actions or such rights only with respect to the amount of Pledged Reserves
Account Funds described in such Pledged Reserve Release Notice and the other
Collateral contained in the Pledged Reserves Account in an amount equal to the
interest and other earnings on such Pledged Reserves Account Funds.

            Section 12.03 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing (including telegraphic, telex, facsimile or cable communication) and
mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered: if to the
Borrower or any Bank, at its address listed opposite its name on the signature
page hereto; and if to the Agent at its Notice Office; or, as to any Bank or the
Agent, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written
notice to the other parties hereto and, as to each other party, at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the Borrower
and the Agent. All such notices and communications shall not be effective until

            Section 12.04 Benefit of Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective
successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the
Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Banks and, provided further, that, no
Bank may transfer or assign its rights or obligations hereunder or under any of
the other Credit Documents, except as provided in this Section 12.04, provided
further, that no Bank shall transfer, grant or assign any participation under
which the participant shall have rights to approve


                                      -34-
<PAGE>
any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any of the other Credit
Documents (i) except to the extent such amendment or waiver (A) extends the
final maturity of any Loan or Note other than in accordance with Section 3.04,
or reduces the rate or extends the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon,
or reduces the principal amount thereof, or increases the Commitment of any Bank
over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any
Default or Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of any
Commitment of any Bank), (B) releases any material portion of the Collateral
under the Security Agreement except as shall be otherwise provided in any Credit
Document, (C) consents to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of
its rights and obligations under any Credit Document, (D) amends the definition
of Loss Threshold Incurrence Date other than to increase the dollar amount or
the percentage specified therein, (E) reduces the percentage specified in the
definition of Majority Participants or (F) amends, modifies or waives any
provision of this Section 12.04 or (ii) except to the extent that a Bank may
permit its Majority Participants to approve any material written amendment,
modification, waiver or release of any other provision of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document which would, if effected, materially adversely affect the
interests of its participants. "Majority Participants" for purposes of this
Section 12.04 shall mean, with respect to each Bank, at any time participants of
such Bank participating in at least 51% of the aggregate principal amount of
Loans made by such Bank and outstanding at such time, or if no such Loans are
outstanding at such time, participants of such Bank participating in at least
51% of the Commitment of such Bank at such time. In the case of any such
participation, the participant shall not constitute a "Bank" hereunder and shall
not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents
(the participant's rights against any Bank in respect of such participation to
be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Bank in favor of the
participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder
shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation, except that
the participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.07 or 4.04 of
this Agreement to the extent that such Bank would be entitled to such benefits
if the participation had not been transferred, granted or assigned.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Bank (or any Bank together
with one or more other Banks) may (and, at the direction of the Borrower
following a rating downgrade of such Bank, shall) assign all or a portion of its
Commitment and related outstanding rights and Obligations hereunder to one or
more Eligible Transferees, each of which assignees shall become a party to this
Agreement as a Bank by execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement and
delivery of such Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Borrower and the
Agent, provided that (i) new Notes will be issued to such new Bank in the stated
amount of its assumed Commitment, and to the assigning Bank in the stated amount
of the Commitment if any, retained by it, upon the request of such new Bank or
assigning Bank and the surrender of the Note previously issued to the assigning
Bank (or the execution and delivery to the Borrower of an indemnity satisfactory
to the Borrower), such new Notes to be in conformity with the requirements of
Section 2.05 to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments, (ii)
unless such assignment is to an Affiliate of such assigning Bank with the same
or higher unsecured senior debt rating, and so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists at the time of such assignment, the Borrower shall have consented
to such assignment, (iii) at the time of such assignment, the


                                      -35-
<PAGE>
new Bank or (except to the extent the new Bank is an affiliate of the assigning
Bank) its parent shall have an unsecured senior debt rating (or shadow rating as
reflected in a letter) by each of Moody's and S&P (A) acceptable to the Borrower
(if such assignment is at the direction of the Borrower) or (B) no lower than
the unsecured senior debt rating (or shadow rating as reflected in a letter) by
each of Moody's and S&P of the assigning Bank or its parent (if such assignment
is not at the direction of the Borrower), (iv) such assignment shall not result
in a downgrading of the Borrower's Rating by Moody's or S&P from that in effect
immediately prior to such assignment, (v) the assigning Bank shall provide
notice of any such assignment to the Agent and the Borrower and the Borrower
shall provide notice of same to Moody's and S&P and (vi) the new Bank shall
deliver a legal opinion addressed to each of the Borrower, Moody's and S&P dated
the effective date of the applicable assignment to the effect that this
Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar laws generally affecting creditor's rights and by equitable
principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law) as
the same may be applied in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings with
respect to such new Bank. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this
Section 12.04(b), the assigning Bank shall be relieved of its obligations
hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitment. To the extent that an
assignment of all or any portion of a Bank's Commitment and related outstanding
Obligations pursuant to this Section 12.04(b) would at the time of such
assignment, result in increased costs under Section 2.07 or 4.04 from those
being charged by the respective assigning Bank prior to such assignment, then
the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type
described above resulting from changes in applicable law, or government rules,
regulations, orders or requests after the date of the respective assignment).

            (c) Upon the execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement in accordance with, and subject to the restrictions of, Section
12.04(b), the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents have
been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have
the rights and obligations of a "Bank" hereunder and thereunder.

            (d) Any Bank claiming any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.04
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions
and subject to overall policy considerations of such Bank) to designate another
lending office for its Commitment or Loans or take such other action to minimize
such amounts, as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower, provided that such
designation is made or such other action is taken on such terms that such Bank
and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage.

            (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Bank
from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support
of borrowings made by such Bank from such Federal Reserve Bank.


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
            (f) Each Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of any change in
the location of its applicable lending office.

            Section 12.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on
the part of any Bank or the holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing
between the Borrower and any Bank or the holder of any Note shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any
other Credit Document, the rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other
Credit Document expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, powers or remedies which any Bank would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of any Bank or the holder of any Note to any other or
further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

            Section 12.06 Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial
statements to be furnished to the Banks pursuant to Section 8.01(a) and (b)
shall be made and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States consistently applied throughout the periods
involved (except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in
writing by the Borrower to the Banks).

            (b) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first
day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest
is payable.

            Section 12.07 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue. (a)
This Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the rights and obligations of
the parties hereunder and thereunder shall be construed in accordance with and
be governed by the law of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict
of law provisions thereof. Any legal action or proceeding against the Borrower
with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit Document may be brought in
the courts of the State of New York or of the United States for the Southern
District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Borrower hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property,
generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The
Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Borrower at its
address set forth opposite its signature below (or to such other address as the
Borrower may from time to time notify the Agent in writing), such service to
become effective 30 days after such mailing. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 4.05, nothing herein shall affect the right of the Agent or any Bank
under this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Borrower in any
other jurisdiction.


                                      -37-
<PAGE>
            (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions
or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in Section 12.07(a) and hereby
further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

            Section 12.08 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of
counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the
Borrower and the Agent.

            Section 12.09 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective
on the date (the "Effective Date") on which the Borrower and the Banks shall
have signed a copy hereof (whether the same or different copies) and shall have
delivered the same to the Agent at its Notice Office and the conditions set
forth in Section 5 shall have been satisfied or waived by the Banks, as
evidenced by a written notice by the Agent to the Borrower confirming that the
Agreement has become effective and setting forth the Effective Date.

            Section 12.10 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several
sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this
Agreement.

            Section 12.11 Amendment or Waiver. Neither this Agreement nor any
other Credit Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or termination is
in writing signed by the Borrower and the Majority Banks and the Agent;
provided, however, that no such change, waiver, discharge or termination shall,
without the consent of each Bank (other than any Bank that is, at the time of
the proposed extension, release, amendment, reduction or consent, a Defaulting
Bank; provided, however, that, with respect to any matter described in clause
(i) or (ii) of this Section 12.11, the consent of each Defaulting Bank which at
such time has a Loan outstanding shall also be required) (i) extend the final
maturity of any Loan or Note other than in accordance with Section 3.04 or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon, or
reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the Commitment of any Bank over
the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any
Default or Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of any
Commitment of any Bank), (ii) release any material portion of the Collateral
under any Security Document except as shall be otherwise provided in any Credit
Document, (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 12.11, (iv)
reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Majority Banks, (v) consent
to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and
obligations under any Credit Document or (vi) amend the definition of Loss

            Section 12.12 Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including,
without limitation, in Sections 2.07, 4.04 and 12.01 shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the making and repayment of the

any Bank (or any participant to whom such Bank has transferred, granted or
assigned any participation in its rights and obligations hereunder and under the
other Credit Documents) is, or upon the occurrence of any contingency would be,
obligated under the terms of a line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement,
letter of credit, liquidity agreement or similar agreement or arrangement to
purchase any Insured Obligation listed in a certificate delivered by the
Borrower to the Agent pursuant to Section 5.06 or 8.01(d), such Bank (or such
participant) shall promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower, that such Bank (or such participant) is or would be so
obligated to purchase such Insured Obligation. Upon delivery by the Agent to the
Borrower of any such notice with respect to an Insured Obligation, such Insured
Obligation shall, effective upon delivery of such notice by the Agent to the
Borrower, be excluded from the Covered Portfolio.

            Section 12.14 Confidentiality. Each of the Agent and each Bank
agrees to take and cause its respective Affiliates to take normal and reasonable
precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentially of all
financial information and all other information reasonably identified as
"confidential" or "secret" by the Borrower and provided to it by the Borrower or
by the Agent on the Borrower's behalf, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates
shall use such information other than is connection with or in enforcement of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents or in connection with other
business now or hereafter existing or contemplated with the Borrower, except to
the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure by the Agent or any Bank or (ii) was or
becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Borrower, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
with the Borrower known to the Agent or such Bank; provided, however, that the
Agent or any Bank may disclose such information (a) at the request or pursuant
to any requirement of any authority to which the Agent or such Bank is subject
or in connection with an examination of the Agent or such Bank by any such
authority; (b) pursuant to subpoena or other court process, provided that if not
prohibited by law, the Agent or such Bank will make reasonable efforts to
provide notice to the Borrower of the receipt of such subpoena prior to
delivering confidential material in response thereto, and the Agent and the
Banks will cooperate with the Borrower in any attempt to obtain a protective
order, at the Borrower's expense, as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrower; (c) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any
applicable law or regulation; (d) to the extent reasonably required in
