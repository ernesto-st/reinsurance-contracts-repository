The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii)
above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election, together with
the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii)&nbsp;above will not, or will cease to, apply to such
Transactions from such date). This election may be made separately for different groups of
Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of branches or offices through which the
parties make and receive payments or deliveries.

Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance
of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section&nbsp;6(c), be
required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other
party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including)
the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default
Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of
days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in
respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required
to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent
provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date
thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference
to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant markets.

the determination, an amount determined on the basis of quotations from Reference Market-makers.
Each quotation will be for an amount, if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a
negative number) or by such party (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement
between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document with respect to the
obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the
&#147;Replacement Transaction&#148;) that would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic
equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent
and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section
2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that would,
but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required after that date.
For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated
Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but
for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each
applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included. The
Replacement Transaction would be subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference
Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent) will
request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably practicable
as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those
quotations are to be obtained will be selected in good faith by the party obliged to make a
determination under Section&nbsp;6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the
other. If more than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean
of the quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If
exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining
after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this purpose, if more than one quotation
has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If
fewer than three quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of
such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.
