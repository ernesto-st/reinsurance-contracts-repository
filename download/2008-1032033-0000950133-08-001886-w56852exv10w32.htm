Purchaser to assign, participate, grant security interests in, or otherwise transfer any portion of
the Note.

obligation) at any time to assign, transfer or syndicate or to grant participation interests in all
or any part of the Note, the Advances, the Pledged Collateral and its other rights and obligations
hereunder to one or more institutions consented to by the Administrator on behalf of the Trust,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being understood that the existence of
a contractual restriction not permitting such assignments entered into by an Affiliate of SLM
Corporation with another lender or prospective lender or financing provider shall, in and of
itself, constitute reasonable grounds for the withholding or delaying of consent to the Note
Purchaser&#146;s proposed assignment or participation);<U> provided</U><I>, </I><U>however</U>, that the Note
Purchaser shall have the right to so assign, transfer or syndicate and to so participate in its
sole discretion and not subject to the aforementioned restrictions on the earliest to occur of (a)
the 180<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> day following the last occurring closing in respect of the other financing
facilities of SLM Corporation or its Affiliates referred to in Section <U>4.02(c)(vi)</U> above,
(b)&nbsp;the 180<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> day following February&nbsp;29, 2008 or (c)&nbsp;the date that a successful
syndication (as described below) shall have occurred in respect of such other financing facilities.
The Administrative Agent shall use its best efforts to execute any assignment or participation
with minimal or no cost to the Trust. The Trust agrees, if requested by the Administrative Agent
in connection with an assignment of the Note in compliance with this Section&nbsp;10.04(b), to execute
or cause the execution of one or more Notes in exchange for the existing Note, reflecting the
outstanding principal amount of the Advances being assigned and retained, and to cause the holders
thereof to be appropriately registered on the note register of the Trust. In the event of such
assignment and issuance of Notes, any references to &#147;the Note&#148; in this Agreement shall be deemed to
refer to all such Notes and holders thereof, except where the context shall otherwise require. It
is further understood that the Note Purchaser shall retain its obligations under the Transaction
Documents notwithstanding any aforementioned participation. As used above, &#147;successful
syndication&#148; means that there shall have occurred assignments and assumptions of the commitments of
the initial lenders/financing providers under the above-referenced other financing facilities, to
an extent at least meeting the applicable target hold levels for such syndication as in effect on
the Closing Date. The Administrator shall notify the Administrative Agent promptly upon completion
of a successful syndication.

rights under this Agreement and under the Transaction Documents to any Federal Reserve Bank within
the United States, without notice to or consent of the Trust or any other Note Purchaser;
<U>provided</U> that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Note Purchaser
from any of its obligations under this Agreement, or substitute any such pledgee or grantee for
such Note Purchaser as a party to this Agreement.
