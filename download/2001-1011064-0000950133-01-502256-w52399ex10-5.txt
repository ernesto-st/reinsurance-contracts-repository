                                    BORROWING

      Section 2.1 The Loan

                  (a) The Lenders agree to lend to the Borrowers pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement from the date hereof until the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, and the Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree to
borrow on a revolving basis from the Lenders from time to time the principal
amount (the "Loan") not to exceed at any time outstanding the lesser of (i) the
Credit Facility Committed Amount, or (ii) the Borrowing Base minus the aggregate
face amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding.

                  (b) The obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loan shall be
evidenced by the Third Amended and Restated Master Promissory Note of even date
herewith (as further amended, restated, substituted, extended, renewed and
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Note") payable to the Administrative
Agent in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A. The Note shall bear interest and
shall be repaid by the Borrowers in the manner and at the times set forth in
Section 2.4 (Interest Rate Matters).

                  (c) The conditions precedent for making an advance under the
Loan shall be as set forth in this Agreement. Sums borrowed and repaid may be
readvanced under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Advances shall be
made by the Lenders on a pro rata basis based on their pro rata shares of the
Credit Facility Committed Amount.

                  (d) No advances may be made or be outstanding under the Credit
Facility and no Letters of Credit may be issued until and during such times as
there are at least six (6) Eligible Projects in the Borrowing Base. The
Borrowers will prepare a Borrowing Base Report (each a "Borrowing Base Report")
in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B which must also be certified by the
Borrowers listing for each of the Eligible Projects (i) the applicable Deed of
Trust Lien Amount, (ii) the Costs Incurred to Date, and (iii) its status as of
the most recent reporting date as a Pool A, Pool B, Pool C or Pool D Project
within thirty (30) days after the end of each month. The Borrowing Base Report
will be based on the outcome of the requisition procedures hereinafter
described, appraisals obtained by the Administrative Agent


                                       24
<PAGE>   31
and other information on the Eligible Projects provided by the Borrowers or
obtained by the Administrative Agent. The Borrowing Base shall be computed based
on the Borrowing Base Report most recently prepared by the Borrowers and
reviewed and accepted by the Administrative Agent. In the event the Borrowers
shall fail to furnish other current reports or information as reasonably
required by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Financing Documents, or in
the event the Administrative Agent believes that a Borrowing Base Report is no
longer accurate, the Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion
exercised from time to time and without limiting its other rights and remedies
under the Financing Documents, upon notice to the Borrowers and the expiration
of a cure period of five (5) Banking Days, designate any Eligible Project as a
Pool D Project or suspend the making of or limit advances under the Loan. The
Borrowing Base shall be subject to reduction as a result of the following
events: (i) the release of an Eligible Project from the lien of the applicable
Deed of Trust, (ii) by the change of any Eligible Project's status as a Pool A
or B Project to a Pool B or C Project or a Pool A, B or C Project to a Pool D
Project respectively, as determined by the Administrative Agent quarterly, or
(iii) the change in appraised value of an Eligible Project pursuant to Section
7.28 (Updated Appraisals). The Borrowing Base shall be subject to increase as a
result of the following events: (i) addition of Eligible Projects, (ii) increase
in the Costs Incurred to Date as determined by the Administrative Agent
quarterly, or (iii) the change of an Eligible Project's status as a Pool B, C or
D Project to a Pool A Project as determined by the Administrative Agent
quarterly. The Borrowers may request and the Requisite Lenders (as defined in
the Agency Agreement) may in their sole discretion agree to include as an
Eligible Project a Completed Facility which a Borrower has acquired which meets
the conditions precedent to including a Completed Facility as an Eligible
Project.

                  (e) The Borrowers shall furnish to the Administrative Agent
such schedules, certificates, lists, records, reports, information and documents
as required by the Administrative Agent from time to time so that the
Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, determine the Borrowing
Base.

                  (f) If at any time the aggregate principal amount of the Loan
outstanding and the Outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds the
Borrowing Base, a borrowing base deficiency ("Borrowing Base Deficiency") shall
exist. Each time a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, the Borrowers shall within
three (3) Banking Days of notice thereof from the Administrative Agent either
pay the amount and/or add Eligible Projects to increase the Borrowing Base to an
amount which is at least equal to the aggregate principal amount outstanding
under the Loan and the Outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations.

                  (g) The current Borrowing Base Report is attached hereto as
EXHIBIT C.

                  (h) As of the date hereof the Borrower has designated and the
Administrative Agent have accepted certain Facilities into the Borrowing Base as
Eligible Projects. This Agreement shall govern the procedures for verification
by the Administrative Agent of Costs Incurred to Date on each Eligible Project
other than an Acquisition Project. This Agreement shall also govern the terms,
conditions and procedures under which Eligible Projects may be added to the
Borrowing Base.

                        (i) The Borrower will give notice to the Administrative
Agent in writing in advance of its intention to add a particular Facility as an
Eligible Project under the Credit Facility. Each Total Development Budget for an
Eligible Project shall include an interest reserve (the "Interest Reserve"), an
Operating Reserve, a hard cost contingency reserve of not less than five percent
(5%) of the total budgeted construction costs and a development fee payable to
SDI (the "Development Fee") each in amounts acceptable to the Administrative
Agent and shall demonstrate to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction in its
sole discretion that the Eligible Project will be designated as a Pool A
Project.

                        (j) Such notice shall include the status of the Facility
as a Construction Project, a Completed Project and/or an Acquisition Project.

      Section 2.2 Procedure for Advances

                  (a) The Administrative Agent will make advances from time to
time upon receipt of written request from the Borrowers in the form designated
by the Administrative Agent, provided that after giving effect to the Borrowers'
request, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan would not exceed the
lesser of the Credit Facility Committed Amount or the Borrowing Base minus the
aggregate face amounts of all Letters of Credit outstanding. Each advance under
the Loan shall be in an amount of not less than $1,000,000, and in increments of
$250,000 in excess thereof. Advances or the renewal of a Interest Period shall
be requested by the Borrowers orally or in writing by 10:00 A.M. (Eastern Time)
three (3) Banking Days prior to the Banking Day on which the funds will be
advanced. The Borrowers shall advise the Administrative Agent at the time of
such notice which Interest Period they are selecting or whether they are
selecting the Base Rate. The Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to
make any advance if at the time such advance is requested and/or is proposed to
be funded, there exists an Event of Default or an event which upon notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute an Event of Default under the Financing
Documents.

                  (b) In addition, if the Administrative Agent has reason to
believe a Default or an Event of Default has occurred, the Borrowers hereby
irrevocably authorize the Lenders to make advances of the Loan at any time and
from time to time, without further request from or notice to the Borrowers,
which the Lenders, in their sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or
appropriate to protect the Lenders' interests under this Agreement or otherwise,
including, without limitation, advances of the Loan made to cover interest on
the Loan, fees, and/or Enforcement Costs, prior to, on, or after the termination
of this Agreement, regardless of whether the aggregate amount of the advances of
the Loan which the Lenders may make hereunder exceeds the Credit Facility
Committed Amount. The Lenders shall have no obligation whatsoever to make any
advance under this subsection and the making of one or more advances under this
subsection shall not obligate the Lenders to make other similar advances. Any
such advances will be evidenced by the Note secured by the Collateral and the
Deeds of Trust.

      Section 2.3 Fees

      The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent the following fees:


                                       26
<PAGE>   33
                        (a) Unused Line Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders beginning on the date set
forth below a quarterly revolving credit facility fee (the "Unused Line Fee") in
an amount equal to twenty-five (25) basis points per annum of the average daily
unused and undisbursed portion of the Loan. The accrued and unpaid portion of
the Unused Line Fee shall be paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent as
of the Credit Facility Closing Date and on the first day of each fiscal quarter
and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

                        (b) Appraisal Fees. Upon the receipt of an appraiser's
invoice from the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall pay the fee of the
appraiser for an Eligible Project or for any Facility appraised at the request
of the Borrowers whether or not a Facility Closing is completed for such
Facility.

      Section 2.4 Interest Rate Matters and Payments

                        (a) Lender Tax Adjustment. Each payment made by the
Borrowers under the Note shall either (i) be exempt from, and be made without
reduction by reason of, any Lender Tax or (ii) to the extent that any such
payment shall be subject to any Lender Tax, be accompanied by an additional
payment by the Borrowers of such amount as may be necessary so that the net
amount received by each Lender (after deducting all applicable Taxes) is the
same as such Lender would have received had such payment not been subject to
such Lender Tax. Upon any payment of Lender Tax by the Borrowers, the Borrowers
shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days) furnish to the Administrative
Agent and applicable Lender such tax receipts, certificates an other evidence of
such payment as the Borrowers may have or the Administrative Agent or the
applicable Lender may reasonably request.

                        (b) Inability to Determine Eurodollar Base Rate. In the
event that the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
London interbank market, quotation of Eurodollar Base Rates for any portion of
the Note are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant
maturities for the purpose of determining a Eurodollar Base Rate for any portion
of the principal sum, the Administrative Agent will give notice of such
determination to the Borrowers and each Lender at least one day prior to the
date of an advance or any subsequent Interest Period for the Loan. If any such
notice is given, no Lender shall have any obligation to make any advance or
maintain any principal sum outstanding at a Eurodollar Base Rate. Until the
earlier of the date any such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative
Agent or the date when the Lenders and the Borrowers have mutually agreed upon
an alternate method of determining the rates of interest payable on the Loan, as
the case may be, the Borrowers shall not have the right to have additional
advances or maintain any portion of the Credit Facility at a Eurodollar Base
Rate, whereupon the Lenders and the Borrowers shall mutually agree upon an
alternate method of determining the rates of interest payable on the Loan or
such Lender's portion of the principal outstanding under the Note shall be
immediately due and payable.

                        (c) Applicable Interest Rates.


                                       27

            (Inability to Determine Eurodollar Base Rate).

                              (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
            occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the
            option of the Administrative Agent, the Loan and all other
            Obligations shall bear interest at the Post-Default Rate.

                              (iii) The Applicable Margin for (i) Eurodollar
            Loans shall be two hundred (200) basis points per annum, and (ii)
            Base Rate Loans shall be zero (0) basis points per annum.

            Interest Rate Election Notice furnished to the Administrative Agent
            in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4(d)(v) (Selection of
            Interest Rates) , the Borrowers may select an initial Applicable

            Loan or may convert the Applicable Interest Rate and, when

            Loan to any other Applicable Interest Rate or, when applicable, any
            other Interest Period.

                              (iii) The Borrowers' selection of an Applicable
            Interest Rate and/or an Interest Period, the Borrowers' election to

            otherwise include a selection of an Applicable Interest Rate and, if
            applicable, an Interest Period, or if, after having made a selection
            of an Applicable Interest Rate and, if applicable, an Interest
            Period, the Borrowers fail or are not otherwise entitled under the
            provisions of this Agreement to continue such Applicable Interest
            Rate or Interest Period, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
            selected the Base Rate as the Applicable Interest Rate until such
            time as the Borrowers have selected a different Applicable Interest
            Rate and specified an Interest Period in accordance with, and
            subject to, the provisions of this Section.

                              (v) The Administrative Agent will not be obligated
            to make advances of the Loan, to convert the Applicable Interest
            Rate on Loans to another Applicable Interest Rate, or to change
            Interest Periods, unless the Administrative Agent shall have
            received an irrevocable written or telephonic notice (an "Interest
            Rate Election Notice") from the Borrowers specifying the following
            information:

                                    (aa)  the amount to be borrowed or
            converted;


                                       29
<PAGE>   36
                                    (bb)  a section of the Base Rate or the
            Eurodollar Rate;

                                    (cc)  the length of the Interest Period if
            the Applicable Interest Rate selected is the Eurodollar Rate; and

                                    (dd)  the requested date on which such
            election is to be effective.

      Any telephonic notice must be confirmed in writing within three (3)
Business Days. Each Interest Rate Election Notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern Standard Time) on the
Business Day of any requested borrowing or conversion in the case of a selection
of the Base Rate and not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern Standard Time) on the
third Business Day before the effective date of any requested borrowing or
conversion in the case of a selection of the Eurodollar Rate.

                        (e) Indemnity. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree
to indemnify and reimburse the Administrative Agent and to hold the
Administrative Agent harmless from any loss, cost (including administrative
costs) or expense which the Administrative Agent may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) a default by the Borrowers in payment when due of the
principal amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan, (b) the failure of the
Borrowers to make, or convert the Applicable Interest Rate of any portion of the
Loan after the Borrowers have given a request for an advance or an Interest Rate
Election Notice, (c) the failure of the Borrowers to make any prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan after the Borrowers have given notice of such intention to make
such a prepayment, and/or (d) the making by the Borrowers of a prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Loan, breakage costs calculated by the Administrative Agent,
including, without limitation, any such loss or expense arising from the
reemployment of funds obtained by the Administrative Agents to maintain any
Eurodollar Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such
funds were obtained. This agreement and covenant of the Borrowers shall survive
termination or expiration of this Agreement and payment of the other
Obligations.

                        (f) Payment of Interest.

                              (i) Unpaid and accrued interest on any portion of
            the Loan which consists of a Base Rate Loan shall be paid monthly,
            in arrears, on the first day of each calendar month, commencing on
            the first such date after the date of this Agreement, and on the
            first day of each calendar month thereafter, and at maturity
            (whether by acceleration, declaration, extension or otherwise).

                              (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all
            unpaid and accrued interest on any Base Rate Loan converted to a
            Eurodollar Loan or prepaid shall be paid immediately upon such
            conversion and/or prepayment, as appropriate.


                                       30
<PAGE>   37
                              (iii) Unpaid and accrued interest on any
            Eurodollar Loan shall be paid monthly and on the last Business Day
            of each Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan and at maturity
            (whether by acceleration, declaration, extension or otherwise);
            provided, however that any and all unpaid and accrued interest on
            any Eurodollar Loan prepaid prior to expiration of the then current
            Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan shall be paid immediately
            upon prepayment.

                        (g) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Financing Documents to the contrary, in the event that it shall become
unlawful for any Lender to obtain funds in the London interbank market or for
such Lender to maintain the Loan at the Eurodollar Base Rate, then, by written
notice to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may declare
that advances will not thereafter be made or the Loan maintained by such Lender
hereunder at the Eurodollar Base Rate, whereupon the rate of interest payable on
the Loan or such Lender's portion of the principal outstanding under the Note
shall be calculated at the Base Rate.

                        (h) Increased Costs and Reduced Return.

                              (i) If any event shall occur (whether in the form
            of a reserve requirement (not included in the definition of the
            Eurodollar Base Rate), exchange control regulations, governmental
            charges, compliance with any guideline or request from any central
            bank or other Governmental Authority, changes in the London
            interbank market or the position of any Lender in such market or
            otherwise) and the result of any such event is, in such Lender's
            reasonable judgment, to increase the costs which such Lender
            determines are attributable to its making or maintaining the Loan at
            the Eurodollar Base Rate in excess of those costs already in effect
            as of June 1, 2001, or its obligation to make available the Loan at
            the Eurodollar Base Rate or to reduce the amount of any sum received
            or receivable by such Lender under the Note, then, within ten (10)
            days after demand by such Lender, Borrowers hereby agree to pay to
            such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
            such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

                              (ii) In addition to any amounts payable pursuant
            to Section (i), if any Lender shall have determined that the
            applicability of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted
            pursuant to or arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle
            Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
            "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
            Standards," or the adoption after the date hereof of any other law,
            rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any
            change in any of the foregoing or in the enforcement or
            interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any
            court or any central bank or other Governmental Authority, charged
            with the enforcement or interpretation or administration thereof, or
            compliance by such Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or
            such Lender's


                                       31
<PAGE>   38
            holding company with any request or directive regarding capital
            adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
            authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the
            effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on
            the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a
            consequence of its making or maintaining the Loan or its incurring
            any obligations under this Agreement to a level below that which
            such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but
            for such applicability, adoption, change or compliance (taking into
            consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such
            Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an
            amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon demand by
            such Lender, the Borrowers hereby agree to pay to such Lender from
            time to time such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
            such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction
            suffered.

                              (i) Notice of Amounts Payable to Lenders. If any
Lender shall seek payment of any amounts from Borrowers pursuant to this Section
or under Section 2.4 (Interest Rate Matters), it shall notify the Borrowers and
the Administrative Agent of the amount payable by the Borrowers to such Lender
hereunder. A certificate of such Lender seeking payment setting forth in
reasonable detail the factual basis for and the computation of the amount
specified, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties for all purposes,
absent manifest error, as to the amounts owned. The Borrowers' obligations under
this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment
of the Obligations.

      Section 2.5 Computation of Interest and Fees

      All applicable fees and interest shall be calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 days for the actual number of days elapsed pursuant to the terms of
the Note and interest shall be payable monthly in arrears.

      Section 2.6 Extensions

      The Borrowers may request that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
in their sole discretion, agree to extend the Revolving Credit Expiration Date
one or more times for a period of twelve (12) months each.

      Section 2.7 The Letter of Credit Facility

                        (a) Letters of Credit. Subject to and upon the
provisions of this Agreement, and as a part of the Credit Facility Committed
Amount, the Borrowers may, upon the prior approval of the Administrative Agent,
obtain standby letters of credit (as the same may from time to time be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified, each a "Letter of Credit" and collectively
the "Letters of Credit") from any Lender selected by the Borrowers from time to
time until the Banking Day preceding the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Each
Letter of Credit shall be issued for a business purpose of any Borrower, any
Accommodator Borrower, SALI or any Affiliate, provided that one or more
Borrowers is a co-obligor with SALI or any Affiliate for the Obligations arising
under such Letter of Credit and executes the applicable


                                       32
<PAGE>   39
Letter of Credit Application to evidence such liability. The Borrower will not
be entitled to obtain a Letter of Credit hereunder unless (a) after giving
effect to the request, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and of the
Letter of Credit Obligations would not exceed the lesser of (i) the Credit
Facility Amount, or (ii) the most current Borrowing Base and (b) the sum of the
aggregate face amount of the then outstanding Letters of Credit (including the
face amount of the requested Letter of Credit) does not exceed Ten Million
Dollars ($10,000,000).

                        (b) Letter of Credit Fees. Prior to or simultaneously
with the opening of each Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent or the other issuing Lender for the benefit of all the
Lenders, a letter of credit fee (each a "Letter of Credit Fee" and collectively
the "Letter of Credit Fees") in an amount equal to one hundred fifty (150) basis
points per annum of the amount of the Letter of Credit and a facing fee of 1/8th
of 1% of the amount of the Letter of Credit for the benefit of the issuing
Lender only. The Letter of Credit Fee but not the facing fee will be pro-rated
if the initial term of a Letter of Credit is less than twelve (12) months. Such
Letter of Credit Fees shall be paid upon the opening of the Letter of Credit and
upon each anniversary thereof, if any. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to
the Lender any and all additional issuance, negotiation, processing, transfer or
other fees to the extent and as and when required by the provisions of any
Letter of Credit Agreement; such additional fees are included in and a part of
the "Fees" payable by the Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement.

                        (c) Terms of Letters of Credit. Each Letter of Credit
shall (a) be opened pursuant to a Letter of Credit Agreement, and (b) expire on
a date not later than the Banking Day preceding the Revolving Credit Expiration
Date; provided, however, if any Letter of Credit does have an expiration date
later than the Banking Day preceding the Revolving Credit Termination Date, as
of the Banking Day preceding the Revolving Credit Termination Date an advance of
the Loan shall be made by the Lender in the face amount of such Letter of Credit
(or Letters of Credit) and the proceeds thereof shall be deposited in an account
titled in the name of the Administrative Agent as trustee for the Borrower. The
proceeds of the trustee account referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be held as collateral for the Letter of Credit (or Letters of
Credit) and in the event of a draw under the Letter of Credit (or Letters of
Credit), used to pay any such draw. The aggregate face amount of all Letters of
Credit at any one time outstanding and issued by the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, plus the amount of
any unpaid Letter of Credit Fees accrued or scheduled to accrue thereon, and
less the aggregate amount of all drafts issued under or purporting to have been
issued under such Letters of Credit that have been paid by the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender, is herein called the "Outstanding Letter of Credit
Obligations".

                        (d) Procedure for Letters of Credit. The Borrower shall
give the Administrative Agent written notice at least three (3) Banking Days
prior to the date on which a Letter of Credit is requested to be opened of their
request for a Letter of Credit. Such notice shall specify if a Lender other than
the Administrative Agent is requested to be the issuing bank for such Letter of
Credit shall be accompanied by a duly executed and delivered Letter of Credit
Agreement. Upon receipt of the Letter of Credit Agreement and the Letter of
Credit Fee, the Administrative Agent or other issuing Lender shall process such
Letter of Credit Agreement


                                       33
<PAGE>   40
in accordance with its customary procedures and open such Letter of Credit on
the Banking Day specified in such notice.

      Section 2.8 Permitted Costs

      Advances under the Borrowing Base shall be made available by the Lenders
pursuant to a Borrowing Base Report issued quarterly by the Administrative Agent
or more frequently in the Administrative Agent's discretion and certified by the
Borrowers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. That portion of the
Borrowing Base composed of Costs Incurred to Date shall be related to
expenditures for each Eligible Facility described in the applicable Total
Development Budget. Each Total Development Budget may include the cost of (i)
the acquisition by the Borrowers of the Land which is the site of such Facility,
(ii) the construction on the Premises of a Facility containing residential units
and common facilities (iii) marketing, staffing and similar pre-opening expenses
and (iv) an Operating Reserve. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative
Agent and to the extent specifically permitted by the Administrative Agent, the
process of verification of Requisitions shall confirm the payment by any of the
Borrowers of the following costs and expenses related to the development of the
Premises and the construction of the Improvements and no others may be included
in a Total Development Budget: (i) the payment of interest when due without
further authorization or consent of the Borrowers; (ii) the actual cost of the
Land and all labor, services, materials, supervision, construction fees and the
like reasonably incurred by any of the Borrowers in connection with the
construction upon the Land of the Improvements in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications; (iii) for the actual cost of pre-opening expenses, marketing
expenses and operations of the Facility to the extent of operating deficits;
(iv) for the actual cost of commitment fees, extension fees, appraisal fees,
closing or settlement costs, fees of attorneys, engineers, architects and
accountants, insurance and bond premiums, ad valorem real estate taxes and other
costs directly related to the development of the Land and the construction,
marketing, initial start-up operating of the Improvements and (v) for the
Development Fee and other pre-opening fees.

      Section 2.9 Requisitions Demonstrating Expenses

      Verification of the Borrowers' Costs Incurred to Date will be administered
by the Administrative Agent's Real Estate Loan Administration Group.
Requisitions for each Eligible Project shall be submitted by the Borrowers from
time to time setting forth costs incurred by or on behalf of the Borrowers shall
be in the form approved by the Administrative Agent (each a "Requisition"
collectively, the "Requisitions") signed by James S. Pope, Larry Hulse,
Christian B. A. Slavin or Jay Beckhorn on behalf of the Borrowers and approved
by the Architect, showing the percentage of completion and setting forth in
trade breakdown form and in such detail as may be required by the Administrative
Agent the amounts expended and/or costs incurred for work done and necessary
materials incorporated in the Improvements. The Requisition shall also show the
percentage of completion of each line item on the applicable Borrower's cost
breakdown approved by the Administrative Agent. The Borrowers shall submit with
each Requisition a statement that the work completed to the date of such
Requisition is of quality consistent with the applicable Plans and
Specifications. In addition, at the time of delivery of each Requisition by the
Borrowers, the Borrowers shall furnish to the Administrative Agent such
additional information (such as paid receipts, invoices, statements of accounts,
etc.)


                                       34
<PAGE>   41
as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require to assure that amounts shown
in the Requisition have been paid by or on behalf of the Borrowers. Requisitions
verified by the Real Estate Loan Administration Group during the course of a
fiscal quarter will be included in the calculation of the next Borrowing Base
Report.

      Section 2.10 Co-Borrower Obligations

      Each Person included in the term "Borrowers", including each Additional
Borrower, hereby covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Lenders as follows:

                        (a) The Obligations include all present and future
indebtedness, duties, obligations, and liabilities, whether now existing or
contemplated or hereafter arising, of any one or more of the Additional
Borrowers or the Existing Borrowers in connection with the Loan.

                        (b) Reference in this Agreement and the other Financing
Documents to the "Borrowers" or otherwise with respect to any one or more of the
Persons now or hereafter included in the definition of "Borrowers" shall mean
each and every such Person and any one or more of such Persons, jointly and
severally, unless the context requires otherwise.

                        (c) For administrative convenience, each Person included
in the term "Borrowers" hereby irrevocably appoints the Primary Borrower as the
Borrowers' attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution (with the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent in the exercise of its sole and absolute
discretion), in the name of the Primary Borrower or in the name of any of the
Borrowers or otherwise to take any and all actions with respect to this
Agreement, the other Financing Documents, the Obligations and/or the Collateral
(including, without limitation, the proceeds thereof) as the Primary Borrower
may so elect from time to time, including, without limitation, actions to (i)
request advances under the Loan, and direct the Administrative Agent to disburse
or credit the proceeds of any advance under the Loan directly to an account of
the Primary Borrower, any one or more of such Persons or otherwise, which
direction shall evidence the making of such advance and shall constitute the
acknowledgment by each such Person of the receipt of the proceeds of the Loan,
(ii) enter into, execute, deliver, amend, modify, restate, substitute, extend
and/or renew this Agreement, any Additional Borrower Joinder Supplement, any
other Financing Documents, security agreements, mortgages, deposit account
agreements, instruments, certificates, waivers, letter of credit applications,
releases, documents and agreements from time to time, and (iii) endorse any
check or other item of payment in the name of such Person or in the name of the
Primary Borrower. The foregoing appointment is coupled with an interest, cannot
be revoked without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, and
may be exercised from time to time through the Primary Borrower's duly
authorized officer, officers or other Person or Persons designated by the
Primary Borrower to act from time to time on behalf of the Primary Borrower.

                        (d) Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to make advances to any one or
more or to all of such Persons, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
upon the written, oral or telephonic request any one or more of the Persons who
is from time to time a Responsible Officer of a Borrower under the provisions of
the most recent certificate of corporate resolutions and/or


                                       35
<PAGE>   42
incumbency of the Person included in the term "Borrowers" on file with the
Administrative Agent and also upon the written, oral or telephone request of any
one of the Responsible Officers.

                        (e) The Administrative Agent assumes no responsibility
or liability for any errors, mistakes, and/or discrepancies in the oral,
telephonic, written or other transmissions of any instructions, orders, requests
and confirmations between the Administrative Agent and any one or more of the
Persons included in the term "Borrowers", any advance under the Loan or any
other transaction in connection with the provisions of this Agreement except
those resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

      Section 2.11 Agreement Among Borrowers

      Without implying any limitation on the joint and several nature of the
Obligations, the Administrative Agent agrees that, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Persons included in the term "Borrowers" may
create reasonable inter-company indebtedness between or among the Persons
included in the term "Borrowers" with respect to the allocation of the benefits
and proceeds of the advances under this Agreement. The Persons included in the
term "Borrowers" agree among themselves, and the Administrative Agent consents
to that agreement, that each such Person shall have rights of contribution from
all of the such Persons to the extent such Person incurs Obligations in excess
of the proceeds of the Loan received by, or allocated to purposes for the direct
benefit of, such Person. All such indebtedness and rights shall be, and are
hereby agreed by the Persons included in the term "Borrowers" to be, subordinate
in priority and payment to the indefeasible repayment in full in cash of the
Obligations, and, unless the Administrative Agent agrees in writing otherwise,
shall not be exercised or repaid in whole or in part until all of the
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Each Person included in
the term "Borrowers" agrees that all of such inter-company indebtedness and
rights of contribution are part of the Collateral and secure the Obligations.
Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby waives all rights of
counterclaim, recoupment and offset between or among themselves arising on
account of that indebtedness and otherwise. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Administrative Agent, no Person included in the term "Borrowers"
shall evidence the inter-company indebtedness or rights of contribution by note
or other instrument, and shall not secure such indebtedness or rights of
contribution with any Lien or security.

      Section 2.12 Benefits to Borrowers

      Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby represents and
warrants to the Administrative Agent that each of them will derive benefits,
directly and indirectly, from each advance under the Loan, both in their
separate capacity and as a member of the integrated group to which each such
Person belongs and because the successful operation of the integrated group is
dependent upon the continued successful performance of the functions of the
integrated group as a whole, because (i) the terms of the consolidated financing
provided under this Agreement are more favorable than would otherwise be
obtainable by such Persons individually, and (ii) the additional administrative
and other costs and reduced flexibility associated with individual financing
arrangements which would otherwise be required if obtainable would substantially
reduce the value to such Persons of the financing.

      Section 2.13 Guaranty

                        (a) Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the Administrative Agent:

                              (i) the due and punctual payment in full (and not
            merely the collectibility) by the other Persons included in the term
            "Borrowers" of the Obligations, including unpaid and accrued
            interest thereon, in each case when due and payable, all according
            to the terms of this Agreement, the Note and the other Financing
            Documents;

                              (ii) the due and punctual payment in full (and not
            merely the collectibility) by the other Persons included in the term
            "Borrowers" of all other sums and charges which may at any time be
            due and payable in accordance with this Agreement, the Note or any
            of the other Financing Documents;

                              (iii) the due and punctual performance by the
            other Persons included in the term "Borrowers" of all of the other
            terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Financing
            Documents;

                              (iv) all the other Obligations of the other
            Persons included in the term "Borrowers";

                        (b) The obligations and liabilities of each Person
included in the term "Borrowers" as a guarantor under this Section shall be
absolute and unconditional and joint and several, irrespective of the

            Obligations.

                        (c) The obligations and liabilities of each Person
included in the term "Borrowers", as guarantor under this Section shall be

recoupment, set off, reduction or defense based upon any claim that such Person

"Borrowers", the Administrative Agent and/or any other guarantor and shall not
be conditional or contingent upon pursuit or enforcement by the Administrative
Agent of any remedies it may have against Persons included in the term
"Borrowers" with respect to this Agreement, the Note or any of the other
Financing Documents, whether pursuant to the terms thereof or by operation of
law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to make any demand upon any of the Persons included in the
term "Borrowers", or to sell the Collateral or otherwise pursue, enforce or
exhaust its or their remedies against the Persons included in the term

deem expedient or advisable. Without limiting the foregoing, it is specifically
understood that any modification, limitation or discharge of any of the
liabilities or obligations of any one or more of the Persons included in the
term "Borrowers", any other guarantor or any obligor under any of the Financing
Documents, arising out of, or by virtue of, any bankruptcy, arrangement,

state law initiated by or against any one or more of the Persons included in the
term "Borrowers", in their respective capacities as borrowers and guarantors
under this Section, or under any of the Financing Documents shall not modify,
limit, lessen, reduce, impair, discharge, or otherwise affect the liability of
each Borrower under this Section in any manner whatsoever, and this Section
shall remain and continue in full force and effect. It is the intent and purpose
of this Section that each Person included in the term "Borrowers" shall and does
hereby waive all rights and benefits which might accrue to any other guarantor
by reason of any such proceeding, and the Persons included in the term
"Borrowers" agree that they shall be liable for the full amount of the
obligations and liabilities under this Section regardless of, and irrespective
to, any modification, limitation or discharge of the liability of any one or
more of the Persons included in the term "Borrowers", any other guarantor or any
obligor under any of the Financing Documents, that may result from any such
proceedings.

            portion of or all of the indebtedness guaranteed by this Section;

                              (v) demand for observance, performance or

            required by law which such Person may lawfully waive.

Administrative Agent to do so, each Person included in the term "Borrowers" will
furnish the Administrative Agent and such other persons as the Administrative
Agent may direct with a written certificate, duly acknowledged stating in detail
whether or not any credits, offsets or defenses exist with respect to this
Section.

      Each Person included in the Term "Borrowers" hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guaranties to the Administrative Agent in its role as administrative

                                  ARTICLE III
                                   COLLATERAL

      Section 3.1 Collateral

      As security for the payment of any and all of the Obligations and for the
Borrowers' performance of, and compliance with, all of the terms, covenants,
conditions, stipulations and agreements contained in the Financing Documents,
the Borrowers hereby assign, grant and convey to the Lenders, and agree that the
Lenders shall have, to the extent permitted by law a perfected, continuing
security interest in, all of the Collateral. The Borrowers further agree that
the Lenders shall have in respect of the Collateral all of the rights and
remedies of a secured party under the Virginia Uniform Commercial Code and the

interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the proceeds of the Collateral
constitute a part of the Collateral, the Borrowers may not dispose of the

business or as otherwise may be permitted by this Agreement or other Security
Agreements. The Borrowers also assign, grant and convey any excess Collateral

obligations of the Accommodator Borrowers under the Accommodator Credit Facility
as security for their Guaranty set forth in Section 2.14 (Limited Guaranty of
Accommodator Credit Facility).

      Section 3.2 Eligible Projects

      The Borrowers shall from time to time designate Facilities owned by any of
the Borrowers as Eligible Projects included in the Borrowing Base pursuant to
the terms hereof. The Facilities which are currently Eligible Projects are
listed on EXHIBIT C attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference or any
future Borrowing Base Report. The Credit Facility shall be secured by (a) the
first lien Deeds of Trust on the fee simple interests of the Borrowers in the

from the lien of its Deed of Trust at any time provided no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and provided at least six (6) Eligible Projects
remain in the Borrowing Base upon payment of any Borrowing Base Deficiency which
would result from such release and certification that the remaining principal
sum outstanding does not exceed then current availability from the Eligible
Projects remaining in the Borrowing Base. In addition, the Borrowers may exclude
an Eligible Project from the calculation of the Borrowing Base without releasing
it from the lien of its Deed of Trust at anytime provided at least six (6)
Eligible Projects remain in the Borrowing Base; provided, however, that all
covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall continue to apply to
such Eligible Project unless expressly otherwise agreed in writing by the
Administrative Agent or as otherwise provided in ARTICLE IX (Events of Default)
hereof. The Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion agree to include a
Facility occupied pursuant to a Qualified Ground Lease; provided, however, that
at no time shall Eligible Projects subject to Qualified Ground Leases, plus
Accommodator Eligible Projects subject to Qualified Ground Leases which are not
a Sunrise Qualified Ground Leases (as defined in the Accommodator Financing
Agreement) comprise more than twenty percent (20%) of the maximum availability

Security Agreements, pursuant to which the owners of each of the Borrowers have
assigned to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders one hundred
percent (100%) of all partnership or member interests in each of the Borrowers.

      Section 3.4 Guaranties

      The Obligations are the subject of the Guaranty Agreement and the
Performance Guaranty executed and delivered by the Guarantor in favor of the
Lenders.

      Section 3.5 Collateral for Obligations

      The Borrowers acknowledge that it is the intention of the Borrowers that
the Collateral and all the Deeds of Trust be security for all of the
Obligations, both those now existing and those hereafter created or incurred by
future loan, advances, extensions of credit or otherwise and


                                       41

whether or not currently contemplated by the Borrowers and/or the Lenders on or
about the date hereof.

      Section 3.6 Costs

      The Borrowers agree to pay on demand, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable laws, all reasonable fees, commissions, costs, charges, travel
expenses and other expenses incurred by the Lenders, or any of them, in
connection with the taking, perfection, preservation, protection and/or release
of any security interest or lien on any of the Collateral or Deeds of Trust. The
foregoing notwithstanding, the Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay the
travel expenses of the Lenders with the exception of travel expenses incurred in
connection with any enforcement actions following the occurrence of an Event of
Default. If the Borrowers elect not to finance a Facility under this Credit
Facility or the Administrative Agent does not approve a Facility for inclusion
in the Borrowing Base, but the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lenders
have incurred costs in connection with reviewing such Facility for inclusion in
the Borrowing Base, including but not limited to appraisal fees, environmental
review fees or legal fees, all of such fees and expenses will be paid by the
Borrowers upon demand by the Administrative Agent.

            connection therewith have been paid in full or posted, as the
            circumstances may require, and that the Improvements meet zoning

            redemption period enjoyed by the Borrower's following a sale at
            foreclosure.

                              (xxi) At the Administrative Agent's sole option
            the Administrative Agent shall have obtained the advice of its own
            local counsel in the jurisdiction where the Facility is located on
            the form and enforceability of any or all of the Financing Documents

            issued and describing such Licenses and the assignability thereof
            under local laws or regulations. If the Eligible Project is not a
            Completed Project and no License can be issued until the Eligible
            Project is at or near completion, the licensing opinion shall
            include a detailed explanation of the procedure for applying for and
            obtaining the License and shall identify the entity that will apply
            for and hold the License.

                              (xxiii) With regard to any Deed of Trust for a
            Facility located in any state having such requirement, the
            Administrative Agent shall have received evidence satisfactory to
            the Administrative Agent that a Certificate of Need has been issued

                              (xxiv) No Eligible Project may be added to the
            Borrowing Base if the Deed of Trust Lien Amount which could be added
            to the Borrowing Base thereby, plus the aggregate Deed of Trust lien
            amounts of all other Eligible Projects would cause the Borrowing
            Base to exceed the then applicable Credit Facility Committed Amount;
            provided, however that in the case of an Eligible Project to be
            constructed or under construction, such Eligible Project may be
            added to the Borrowing Base if sufficient equity is contributed by
            the Borrowers to permit the Facility to be completed within the
            Credit Facility Committed Amount and if all of the equity is funded
            prior to any advance of the Loan for such Eligible Project.

                              (xxv) In addition, no Eligible Project may be
            added to the Borrowing Base if its Deed of Trust Lien Amount plus
            the maximum aggregate Deed of Trust Lien Amounts of all other
            Eligible Projects and the Aggregate Deed of Trust Lien Amounts of
            all Accommodator Eligible Projects would cause the Borrowing Bases
            of the Credit Facility and the Accommodator Credit Facility to
            exceed the Credit Facility Committed Amount plus the Accommodator
            Facility Committed Amount.

            a title insurance commitment or endorsement to the title insurance

            the Lenders shall advance under the Loan at least enough funds to

of the existing title insurance policy, the Administrative Agent shall have
received an endorsement which shall have the effect of advancing the effective
date of the policy to the date of the advance then being made and increasing the

the policy does not by its terms provide for such an increase.

                        (b) No Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing under any Note or any of the other Financing Documents.

                        (d) The Administrative Agent shall have received written

                        (i) Before verifying any Requisition, the Administrative
Agent shall require the Borrowers to obtain from the applicable General
Contractor and if required by the applicable title insurance company from all

      Section 4.4 Liens; Setoff

      The Borrowers hereby grant to the Lenders a continuing lien and security
interest for all the Obligations upon any and all monies, securities, and other
property of the Borrowers and the proceeds thereof, now or hereafter held or
received by or in transit to, the Lenders, or any affiliate of any of the
Lenders, from or for any of the Borrowers, and also upon any and all deposits
(general or special) and credits of any of the Borrowers with any of the
Lenders, if any, at any time existing. During the continuance of any Event of
Default under this Agreement, each Lender is hereby authorized by any of the
Borrowers at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Borrowers, to
set off, appropriate and apply any or all items hereinabove referred to against
all Obligations then outstanding.

      Section 4.5 Payment and Performance of Obligations

      The payment and performance by the Borrowers of the Obligations shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any defense or any rights of
set-off, recoupment or counterclaim it might otherwise have against the Lenders,
or any of them, and the Borrowers shall pay absolutely net all of the
Obligations, free of any deductions and without abatement, diminution or
set-off; and until payment in full of all of the Obligations, the Borrowers: (a)
will not suspend or discontinue any payments provided for in the Note and (b)
will perform and observe all of its other agreements contained in this
Agreement, including (without limitation) all payments required to be made to
the Administrative Agent, and (c) will not terminate or attempt to terminate
this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents to which any of the
Borrowers is a party for any cause.

      Section 4.6 Payments to Others for the Account of the Borrowers

      At the option of the Lenders and without any request from the Borrowers,
and without waiving any of its rights hereunder, the Lenders may elect to cure
or avoid any default by the Borrowers under the Financing Documents by applying
amounts due hereunder or advancing the Lenders' own funds to the satisfaction of
the conditions of the Financing Documents and any amounts so applied shall be
part of the Loan and shall be secured by the Deeds of Trust and the other
Collateral. The Administrative Agent agrees to endeavor to give the Borrowers
notice of any such payment or performing such act and the amount of any payment
whether prior to or


                                       51
<PAGE>   58
contemporaneously with its making such payment or performance of such act;
provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not constitute a
waiver by the Lenders of, or constitute a defense to, any of the rights of the
Lenders under this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, including
(without limitation) the right of the Lenders to repayment of the amount of such
payment.

      Section 4.7 Prepayment

      The Borrowers shall have the right to prepay the Loan in full or in part,
at any time and from time to time, upon five (5) days' prior written notice to
the Administrative Agent without premium or penalty. The foregoing
notwithstanding, in connection with any prepayment of a principal sum on any day
other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrowers
shall pay to the Administrative Agent upon request by the Administrative Agent,
such amount as shall be sufficient to compensate any of the Lenders for any and
all losses or expenses which such Lender may sustain or incur (including without
limitation, any such loss or expense arising from the redeployment of funds
obtained by such Lender). Unless an Event of Default has occurred, any partial
prepayment shall be applied first to such breakage costs, second to accrued and
unpaid interest and third to the outstanding principal balance of the Loan due
and owing at maturity. Sums borrowed and repaid may be readvanced. The
Borrowers' obligations under this Section shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations.

      Section 4.8 Assignments

      The Borrowers agree not to transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate any
right or interest in any payment or advance due pursuant to this Agreement, or
any of the other benefits of this Agreement, without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent. Any assignment made or attempted by the Borrowers,
or any of them, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent
shall be void and of no effect. No consent by the Administrative Agent to an
assignment by the Borrowers shall release the Borrowers as the parties primarily
obligated and liable under the terms of this Agreement unless the Borrowers
shall be released specifically by the Administrative Agent in writing. No
consent by the Administrative Agent to an assignment shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the requirement of prior written consent by the Administrative Agent
with respect to each and every further assignment and as a condition precedent
to the effectiveness of such assignment.

      Section 4.9 Liability of the Lenders

      The Lenders shall in no event be responsible or liable to any person other
than the Borrowers for the disbursement of or failure to disburse the Loan
proceeds or any part thereof and neither the General Contractor nor any
subcontractor, laborer or material supplier shall have any right or claim
against the Lenders under this Agreement or the administration thereof. No
Lender shall be liable to the Borrowers for the failure of any other Lender to
fund its ratable portion of any advance pursuant to the Agency Agreement.

<PAGE>   59
      Section 4.10 Stored Materials

      The Administrative Agent will permit inclusion of construction materials
(the "Stored Materials") to be included in Requisitions prior to their
incorporation into the Improvements if they have been fully paid for by or on
behalf of the applicable Borrower. The Borrowers shall securely store or cause
to be securely stored any Stored Materials. If required by the Administrative
Agent for any Stored Materials not stored on the Property, the Borrowers will
execute additional documents to confirm that the Lenders have a perfected Lien
on such Stored Materials.

      Section 4.11 Limitations on Advances or Readvances

      The following additional limitations on availability under the Loan shall
also apply:

                        (a) Interest Reserve. Except as provided in Section 2.8
(Permitted Costs), after the earlier of the issuance of certificate of occupancy
for a Facility or the expiration of the Construction Phase, no further
availability under the Borrowing Base shall be given from the Interest Reserve
category in such Total Development Budget.

                        (b) Development Fee. Availability under the Borrowing
Base for the Development Fee for any Eligible Project other than an Eligible
Project originally financed as an Accommodator Eligible Project will be given
ratably with the first twelve (12) monthly Requisitions. For any Eligible
Project which was previously an Accommodator Eligible Project, the Lenders will
approve availability under the Borrowing Base for such portion of the
Development Fee as would have been accrued based on the number of months the
Facility has been under construction times one-twelfth (1/12th) of the
Development Fee for such Facility. The Development Fee shall not exceed five
percent (5%) of the Total Development Budget.

                        (c) Operating Reserve. No advances from the Operating
Reserve shall be made until both a certificate of occupancy has been issued by
the applicable governmental authorities and, if applicable to the Facility, an
operating License has been issued for the Facility by the appropriate
Governmental Authority or Authorities. Advances from the Operating Reserve shall
be for the sole purpose of paying Debt Service or net operating losses as shown
on a monthly financial report for such Facility prepared in accordance with the
requirements set forth in this Agreement, and certified by the Chief Financial
Officer, Executive Vice President or President of the Guarantor.

      Section 4.12 Feasibility Studies.

      The Borrowers and the Administrative Agent agree that a Borrower may
request that the Administrative Agent order a market feasibility study from an
appraiser or other third-party consultant for any proposed Facility under
consideration to become an Eligible Project. The Borrowers agree that such study
is for informational purposes only and that the Administrative Agent is not
warranting the accuracy, completeness or reliability of any such study and

      To induce the Lenders to make available the Credit Facility, the Borrowers
represent and warrant to the Lenders that:

      Section 5.1 Existence/Good Standing

      Each Borrower is a limited partnership or a limited liability company duly
organized and existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its formation, has the power to own its property and to carry on its business
as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which each Facility owned by such Borrower is
located and in which the character of the properties owned by it therein or in
which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary.

      Section 5.2 Power and Authority

      Each Borrower has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each of the other Financing Documents executed and delivered by
it, to make the borrowing hereunder, and to incur the Obligations, all of which
have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary partnership action. No
consent or approval of partners or members of, or lenders to, the Borrowers, and
no consent or approval of any Governmental Authority or any third party payor on
the part of the Borrowers, is required as a condition to the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents
executed and delivered by any of the Borrowers or to the payment or performance
by the Borrowers of the Obligations.

      Section 5.3 Binding Agreements

      This Agreement and each of the other Financing Documents executed and
delivered by the Borrowers have been properly executed by the Borrowers,
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrowers, and are fully
enforceable against the Borrowers in accordance with their respective terms.

      Section 5.4 Litigation

      There are no proceedings pending before any court or arbitrator or before
or by any Governmental Authority which, in any one case or in the aggregate,

other Financing Documents executed and delivered by any of the Borrowers. There
is no pending revocation, suspension, termination, probation, restriction,


                                       54

accreditation or approval organization or Governmental Authority for healthcare
providers, including, without limitation, the issuance of any provisional
License or other License with a term of less than twelve (12) months, as a
consequence of any sanctions imposed by any Governmental Authority, nor is there
any pending assessment of any civil or criminal penalties by any Governmental
Authority, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to any of the

source, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to any of the Borrowers,
could result in a Material Adverse Change in any of the Borrowers. There are no
Medicare or Medicaid recoupments or recoupments of any other third party payor
being sought, requested or claimed, against any of the Borrowers, the outcome of

existing mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement binding on any of the

provision of law or order of court binding upon any of the Borrowers, which
would conflict with or in any way prevent the execution, delivery, or
performance of the terms of this Agreement or of any of the other Financing
Documents executed and delivered by any of the Borrowers, or which would be
violated as a result of such execution, delivery or performance, or, if so, all

necessary to complete the development of such Land and the construction of the
Improvements thereon (whether or not in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications therefor) and to employ watchmen to protect the Property and the
Improvements. All sums expended by the Lenders for such purposes shall be deemed
to have been advanced to the Borrowers under the Note and shall be secured by
the Deeds of Trust and the Collateral. For this purpose, the Borrowers hereby
constitute and appoint the Lenders, or the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lenders, its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to

                        (c) To employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents,
architects and inspectors as shall be necessary or desirable for said purpose;

                        (d) To pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and
claims which are or may be liens against any of the Property, or may be
necessary or desirable for the completion of the work or the clearance of title

                        (e) To execute all applications and certificates which
may be required in the name of any of the Borrowers; and

or proceedings in connection with the development of the Land and the
construction of the Improvements and to take such actions and to require such
performance as the Lenders may deem necessary.

      Section 10.6 Uniform Commercial Code and Other Remedies

      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (and in addition to all of its
rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement), the Lenders shall have all of
the rights and remedies of a secured party under the applicable Uniform
Commercial Code and other applicable laws, and the Lenders are authorized to
offset and apply to all or any part of the Obligations all moneys, credits and
other property of any nature whatsoever of the Borrowers now or at any time

Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall assemble the Collateral and make it
available to the Lenders, at a place designated by the Administrative Agent; and
the Lenders or their agents may enter upon the Borrowers' premises to take

otherwise dispose of it.

the Lenders with respect to the Collateral which is sent by regular mail,

the Lenders, or any of them, in preparing for sale or other disposition,
selling, managing, collecting or otherwise disposing of, the Collateral. All of
such costs and expenses (the "Liquidation Costs") together with interest thereon
from the date incurred until paid in full at the Post-Default Rate, shall be
paid by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent on demand and shall constitute
and become a part of the Obligations. Any proceeds of sale or other disposition
of the Collateral will be applied by the Lenders to the payment of the
Liquidation Costs and Expense Payments, and any balance of such


                                       89

days notice and without regard to the adequacy of the security, and upon
application to a court of competent jurisdiction, the Lenders shall be entitled
to the immediate appointment of a receiver for all or any part of the
Collateral, and of the payments and proceeds thereof and therefrom, whether such
receivership be incidental to a proposed sale of the Collateral or otherwise,
and the Borrowers hereby consent to the appointment of such a receiver and to an
order of court directing that payments, including Medicare and Medicaid
payments, be made directly to the receiver. The Borrowers will pay to the
Beneficiary, upon demand, all expenses, including receiver's fees, attorney's
fees, costs and agents compensation, advanced by the Borrowers and incurred
pursuant to the provisions contained in this Section.

      Section 10.8 No Conditions Precedent to Exercise of Remedies

      The Borrowers shall not be relieved of any obligation by reason of the
failure of the Lenders to comply with any request of the Borrowers or of any
other person to take action to foreclose on the Property under the Deed of Trust
or otherwise to enforce any provision of the Financing Documents, or by reason
of the release, regardless of consideration, of all or any part of the Property,
or by reason of any agreement or stipulation between any subsequent owner of the
Property and the Lenders extending the time of payment or modifying the terms of
the Financing Documents without first having obtained the consent of the
Borrowers; and in the latter event, the Borrowers shall continue to be liable to
make payments according to the terms of any such extension or modification
agreement, unless expressly released and discharged in writing by the Lenders.

under the Financing Documents, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity
or by statute. Every right, power and remedy given by the Financing Documents to

separately, successively or together against any or all of the Borrowers or the
Property or any part thereof, and every right, power and remedy given by the
Financing Documents may be exercised from time to time as often as may be deemed
expedient by the Lenders or the Administrative Agent.

      Section 10.10 Strict Performance

      No delay or omission of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to
exercise any right, power or remedy accruing upon the happening of an Event of
Default shall impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be

granted to the Lenders hereunder in any one or more instances, or the acceptance
by the Lenders of any partial payment on account of the Obligations shall
constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default and each such option shall
remain continuously in full force and effect.

irrevocably appoints Sunrise Assisted Living Investments, Inc. ("SALII") as the
Additional Borrower's attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution (with the

under the Credit Facility and direct the Administrative Agent to disburse or
credit the proceeds of any Loan directly to an account of SALII, any one or more
of the other entities comprising the Borrower, the Additional Borrower or
otherwise, which direction shall evidence the making of such Loan and shall
constitute the acknowledgement by the Borrower of the receipt of the proceeds of
such Loan, (b) enter into, execute, deliver, amend, modify, restate, substitute,
extend and/or renew this Agreement, any other Financing Documents, security
