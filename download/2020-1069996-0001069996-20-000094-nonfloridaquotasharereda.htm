The inuring limit to Corporate Core Reinsurance Program will be based on inuring      loss paid by this Contract and other inuring reinsurance as purchased in accordance with Article      13 - Reinsurance Allowance.

Any funding in a multi-     beneficiary trust shall include an amount of incurred but not reported loss reserves as calculated      by the Company.        Notwithstanding the provisions of the Arbitration Article, if a Runoff Subscribing Reinsurer fails to      fund its share of the Subscribing Reinsurer's obligations under this Contract as set forth above,      the Company retains its right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable or interim      relief.

The Subscribing Reinsurer, at its sole option, may fund in other than cash if its method and form      of funding are acceptable to the Company and the insurance regulatory authorities involved.

To refund to the Subscribing Reinsurer any sum in excess of the actual amount required to           fund the Subscribing Reinsurer's obligations, if so requested by the Subscribing Reinsurer.        In the event the amount drawn by the Company on any letter of credit is in excess of the actual      amount required for C(1), C(2) or C(4) above, or in the case of C(3) above, the actual amount      determined to be due, the Company shall promptly return to the Subscribing Reinsurer the      excess amount so drawn.    D.  At annual intervals, or more frequently as agreed but never more frequently than quarterly, the      Company shall prepare a specific statement, for the sole purpose of amending the respective      letters of credit, of the Subscribing Reinsurer's obligations.  Amendments shall be made to said      letters of credit in accordance with the following:         1.  If the statement shows that the Subscribing Reinsurer's obligations exceed the balance of           credit applicable thereto as of the statement date, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall, within           30 days after receipt of notice of such excess, secure delivery to the Company of an           amendment or amendments of the respective letters of credit increasing the amount of           credit by the amount of the applicable difference.         2.  If, however, the statement shows that the Subscribing Reinsurer's obligations are less than           the balance of credit applicable thereto as of the statement date, the Company shall, within           30 days after receipt of written request from the Subscribing Reinsurer, release such excess           credit by agreeing to secure an amendment or amendments to the respective letters of           credit reducing the amount of credit available by the amount of the applicable excess credit.      Article 26 - Insolvency   A.  This Article shall apply severally to each reinsured company referenced within the definition of      &quot;Company&quot; in this Contract.  Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary jurisdiction shall      apply in the event of the insolvency of any company intended to be covered hereunder.  In the      event of a conflict between any provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary jurisdiction      of any company intended to be covered hereunder, that domiciliary jurisdiction's laws shall      prevail.    B.  In the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance under this Contract shall be      payable directly to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor      on the basis of the liability of the Company without diminution because of the insolvency of the      Company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company      has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim.  However, the liquidator, receiver, conservator or      statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of      a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond reinsured which claim would involve a      possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in      the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and during the pendency of such      claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the      proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem      available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.  The      expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court,      against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro      rata share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense      undertaken by the Reinsurer.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  C.  Where two or more Subscribing Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in      interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance      with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company.    D.  In the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance under this Contract shall be      payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver or statutory      successor, except as provided by Section 4118(a) of the New York Insurance Law or except      (1) where this Contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the      insolvency of the Company or (2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or      insureds has assumed such policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the      Reinsurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the      Company to such payees.      Article 27 - Arbitration   A.  As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or difference      of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, such dispute or difference of opinion      shall be submitted to arbitration.  One arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the      Reinsurer, and an umpire shall be chosen by the two arbiters before they enter upon arbitration,      all of whom shall be disinterested active or former officials or experienced individuals who have      operated in, or been involved in, business placed in the United States insurance or reinsurance      industry for at least 10 years.  In the event that either party should fail to choose an arbiter within      30 days following a written request by the other party to do so, the requesting party may choose      two arbiters who shall in turn choose an umpire before entering upon arbitration.  If the two      arbiters fail to agree upon the selection of an umpire within 30 days following their appointment,      the two arbiters shall request the American Arbitration Association to appoint the umpire.  If the      American Arbitration Association fails to appoint the umpire within 30 days after it has been      requested to do so, either party may request a justice of a Court of general jurisdiction of the state      in which the arbitration is to be held to appoint the umpire.  Notwithstanding the above, in the      event the dispute or difference of opinion involves a Runoff Subscribing Reinsurer, the Company      may, at its option, choose to forgo arbitration and may bring an action in any court of competent      jurisdiction.  Such court shall award costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees      and other expenses, if the Company prevails in such action.    B.  Each party shall present its case to the arbiters within 30 days following the date of appointment      of the umpire.  The arbiters shall consider this Contract as an honorable engagement rather than      merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial formalities and may abstain from      following the strict rules of law.  The decision of the arbiters shall be final and binding on both      parties; but failing to agree, they shall call in the umpire and the decision of the majority shall be      final and binding upon both parties.  Judgment upon the final decision of the arbiters may be      entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbiters may award costs and expenses,      including reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses.    C.  If more than one Subscribing Reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such Subscribing      Reinsurers shall, at the option of the Company, constitute and act as one party for purposes of      this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the Subscribing      Reinsurers constituting one party, provided, however, that nothing herein shall impair the rights of      such Subscribing Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint, defenses or claims, nor be      construed as changing the liability of the Subscribing Reinsurers participating under the terms of      this Contract from several to joint.

Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbiter, and shall jointly and equally bear with the      other the expense of the umpire and of the arbitration.  In the event that the two arbiters are      chosen by one party, as above provided, the expense of the arbiters, the umpire and the      arbitration shall be equally divided between the two parties.    E.  Any arbitration proceedings shall take place at a location mutually agreed upon by the parties to      this Contract, but notwithstanding the location of the arbitration, all proceedings pursuant hereto      shall be governed by the law of the State of Florida.    F.  In the event the dispute or difference of opinion involves a Runoff Subscribing Reinsurer and the      Company prevails in the arbitration, the arbiters shall conduct a bad-faith assessment in      accordance with applicable law as soon as practicable after their decision.  The arbiters shall      award any necessary and legally permissible punitive damages to the Company.      Article 28 - Service of Suit   (Applicable if the Subscribing Reinsurer is not domiciled in the United States of America, and/or is not  authorized in any state, territory or district of the United States where authorization is required by  insurance regulatory authorities)    A.  This Article shall not be read to conflict with or override the obligations of the parties to arbitrate      their disputes as provided for in the Arbitration Article.  This Article is intended as an aid to      compelling arbitration or enforcing such arbitration or arbitral award, not as an alternative to the      Arbitration Article for resolving disputes arising out of this Contract.    B.  In the event the Subscribing Reinsurer fails to perform its obligations hereunder, the Subscribing      Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, shall submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent      jurisdiction within the United States.  Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be understood to      constitute a waiver of the Subscribing Reinsurer's rights to commence an action in any court of      competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court,      or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of      any state in the United States.  The Subscribing Reinsurer, once the appropriate Court is      accepted by the Subscribing Reinsurer or is determined by removal, transfer or otherwise, as      provided for above, shall comply with all requirements necessary to give said Court jurisdiction      and, in any suit instituted against any of the Subscribing Reinsurers upon this Contract, shall      abide by the final decision of such Court or of any Appellate Court in the event of an appeal.    C.  Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which makes      provision therefor, the Subscribing Reinsurer hereby designates the party named in its Interests      and Liabilities Agreement, or if no party is named therein, the Superintendent, Commissioner or      Director of Insurance or other officer specified for that purpose in the statute, or his or her      successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any      lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the Company or any      beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract.      Article 29 - Governing Law (BRMA 71B)   This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.
