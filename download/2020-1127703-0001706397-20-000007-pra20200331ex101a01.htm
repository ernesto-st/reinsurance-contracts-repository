(a)   The aggregate purchase price for all Authorized Conversion Shares shall  be  the  sum  of  the  following  (the  &#8220;PRA  Consideration&#8221;):  (i)  a  fixed  amount  of  $450,000,000  assuming all Policyholders are Stock Subscribers  (the &#8220;Fixed PRA Consideration&#8221;) and (ii) a  contingent amount of up to $150,000,000 to be determined as provided in Section 3.2(b) hereof  (the &#8220;Contingent PRA Consideration&#8221;).  For each share of NORCAL Common Stock issued in  the Conversion, PRA agrees to pay to the holder of a share of NORCAL Common Stock cash in  an amount equal to such holder&#8217;s pro rata share of each of the Fixed PRA Consideration and the  Contingent PRA Consideration with such pro rata share to be determined on a per share basis by  dividing the total number of Authorized Conversion Shares into the amount of each of the Fixed  PRA Consideration and the Contingent PRA Consideration.  The per share amount of the Fixed  PRA Consideration and the Contingent PRA Consideration (the &#8220;Per Share Offer Price&#8221;) shall  be payable to the Selling Stockholders in cash as provided in Article 4 hereof.  For the avoidance  of doubt, the Fixed PRA Consideration and Contingent PRA Consideration shall be payable only  to those Eligible Policyholders who elect to receive NORCAL Common Stock in the Conversion  and who tender their shares of NORCAL Common Stock to PRA pursuant to the Offer so that  the total consideration paid by PRA under this Section 3.2(a) will be reduced by an amount equal  to the aggregate Per Share Offer Price for the number of shares of NORCAL Common Stock that  would  have  been issued  to  the  Certificate  Subscribers  and  Cash  Subscribers  if  the  Certificate  Subscribers and Cash Subscribers had elected to become Stock Subscribers in the Conversion.   By way of example, assuming that the total number of Authorized Conversion Shares (being the  total number of shares of NORCAL Common Stock authorized to be issued in the Conversion) is  8,800,000 shares and that the total amount of the Contingent PRA Consideration is ultimately  determined  to  be  $150,000,000,  the  Per  Share  Offer  Price  for  a share  of  NORCAL  Common  Stock pursuant to the Offer shall be $68.1818181818 which is an amount equal to the sum of (i)  $51.1363636363  (determined  by  dividing  the  number  of  Authorized  Conversion  Shares  (8,800,000)  into  the  Fixed  PRA  Consideration  ($450,000,000));  and  (ii)  $17.0454545454  (determined  by  dividing  the  number  of  Authorized  Conversion  Shares  (1,000,000)  into  the                                         16  43126503 v1 </FONT></DIV>

Neither NORCAL nor any NORCAL Subsidiary has waived  any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a  Tax Return or tax assessment or deficiency other than extensions that are automatically granted  by the taxing authorities upon filing an application therefor.  The unpaid Taxes of NORCAL and  the  NORCAL  Subsidiaries  do  not  exceed  the  reserve  for  tax  liability  set  forth  on  the  balance  sheets referenced in Section 5.7(a) of this Agreement as adjusted for the passage of time through  the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice of NORCAL in filing its returns.   No written claim  (which remains  unresolved) has  been made since December 31, 2016 by  an  authority  in  a  jurisdiction  where  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Subsidiary  does  not  file  Tax  Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

NORCAL  and  each  NORCAL  Subsidiary  in  connection  with  amounts paid or owed to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other  third party have complied with applicable tax withholding in all material respects.  NORCAL  and each NORCAL Subsidiary have reported such withheld amounts to the appropriate taxing  authority and to each such employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third  party as required by Applicable Law.               (d)   There  are no Tax  Liens  upon any property or assets  of NORCAL or its  Subsidiaries except for Permitted Liens.  Neither NORCAL nor any NORCAL Subsidiary has  been required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason  of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by NORCAL or any NORCAL Subsidiary,  and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method.   Except  as  set  forth  in  the  financial  statements  described  in  Section 5.7(a) of  this  Agreement,  neither NORCAL nor  any NORCAL Subsidiary has  entered into a transaction which is  being  accounted for as an installment obligation under Section 453 of the Code.  Neither NORCAL nor  any  NORCAL  Subsidiary  is  a  party  to  or  bound  by  any  tax  indemnity,  tax  sharing  or  tax  allocation  agreement  (other  than  such  agreements  as  exist  by  and  among  themselves  or  customary  Tax  indemnifications  contained  in  ordinary  course  commercial  contracts  with  third  parties  that do  not  relate  primarily  to  Taxes).   Except  as  set  forth  in  Section  5.13(d)  of  the  NORCAL  Disclosure  Schedule,  since  January  1,  2013,  neither  NORCAL  nor  any  NORCAL  Subsidiary  has  been  a  member  of  an  affiliated  group  of  corporations  within  the  meaning  of  Section  1504  of  the  Code  other  than  an  affiliated  group  in  which  NORCAL  has  been  the  common parent corporation.  Neither NORCAL nor any NORCAL Subsidiary is liable for the  Taxes  of  any  person  under  Section  1.1502  6  of  the  Treasury  Regulations  (or  any  similar                                         35  43126503 v1 </FONT></DIV>

(f)   Neither  NORCAL  nor  any  NORCAL  Subsidiary  is  a  party  to  any  employment, severance or termination agreement or other compensation arrangement (including  any NORCAL Employee Plan) with any individual that obligates NORCAL or any NORCAL  Subsidiary  to  reimburse  any  employee  for  any  taxes  attributable  to  a  &#8220;parachute  payment&#8221;  Section 280G of the Code.          5.13  Employee Plans; Labor Matters.

Each such NORCAL Benefit Plan has  been timely amended, as necessary, to reflect mandatory changes required by Applicable Law.

All benefits, contributions and premiums relating  to each NORCAL Benefit Plan have been timely paid in material compliance with the terms of  such NORCAL Benefit Plan and all Applicable Laws and accounting principles, and all benefits  accrued under  any  unfunded  NORCAL  Benefit  Plan  have  been  paid,  accrued  or  otherwise  adequately  reserved  to  the  extent  required  by,  and  in  accordance  with,  generally  accepted  accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;).

NORCAL  has  not  declared any policyholder dividend which has not been paid prior to the date of this Agreement.               (h)   All  reinsurance  treaties  or  agreements,  including  retrocessional  agreements, to which NORCAL or any NORCAL Insurance Subsidiary is a party or under which  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiary  has  any  existing  rights,  obligations  or  liabilities are listed on Section 5.21(h) of the Disclosure Schedule (the &#8220;NORCAL Reinsurance  Treaties&#8221;).   NORCAL  has  provided  PRA  with  correct  and  complete  copies  of  all  of  such  NORCAL Reinsurance Treaties and all such NORCAL Reinsurance Treaties are in full force and  effect, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result  in  any  party  having  the  right  to  terminate  a  NORCAL  Reinsurance  Treaty.   The  NORCAL  Reserves at each of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as reflected in the NORCAL  SAP Statements, are stated net of reinsurance ceded amounts.  The NORCAL SAP Statements  accurately  reflect  as  of  and  for  the  dates  indicated  therein  the  extent  to  which,  pursuant  to  Insurance  Laws,  NORCAL  and/or  the  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiaries  are  entitled  to  take  credit  for  reinsurance  under  the  NORCAL  Reinsurance  Treaties.   To  the  Knowledge  of  NORCAL, all reinsurance recoverable amounts reflected in the NORCAL SAP Statements are  collectible, and NORCAL is unaware of any material adverse change in the financial condition  of  its  reinsurers  that  might  raise  concern  regarding  their  ability to  honor  their  reinsurance  commitments, except as set forth in Section 5.21(h) of the NORCAL Disclosure Schedule.  No  party to any of the NORCAL Reinsurance Treaties has given written or, to the Knowledge of  NORCAL,  oral  notice  to  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiary  that  such  party  intends  to  terminate  or  cancel  any  of  the  NORCAL  Reinsurance  Treaties  as  a  result  of  or  following  consummation  of  the  Conversion  and  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement.  Each NORCAL Reinsurance Treaty is (assuming due authorization, execution and  delivery  by  each  other  party  thereto)  valid  and  binding  on  NORCAL  and  each  NORCAL  Insurance Subsidiary party thereto, and none of NORCAL, any NORCAL Insurance Subsidiary,  and, to the Knowledge of NORCAL, any other party thereto, is in default in any material respect                                         50  43126503 v1 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">with respect to any NORCAL Reinsurance Treaty.  No NORCAL Reinsurance Treaty contains  any  provision  providing  that  the  other  party  thereto  may  terminate  the  same  by  reason  of  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or contains any other provision which would be  altered  or  otherwise  become  applicable  by  reason  of  such  transactions.   Since  December  31,  2018 no NORCAL Reinsurance Treaty has been canceled and there has not been any change in  the retention level under any of such NORCAL Reinsurance Treaty.               (i)   Each of the NORCAL SAP Statements, as of the date thereof, sets forth all  of  the  loss  and  loss  adjustment  expense  reserves  of  NORCAL  and  the  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiaries as of such date (collectively, the &#8220;NORCAL Reserves&#8221;).  The NORCAL Reserves  were determined in accordance with SAP in all material respects and generally accepted actuarial  methods and standards, consistently applied except as set forth therein, and were fairly stated in  all  material  respects  in  accordance  with  sound  actuarial  and  statutory  accounting  principles.   NORCAL has provided or made available to PRA copies of all internally prepared work papers  used  as  the  basis  for  establishing  the  NORCAL  Reserves.   Except  for  regular  periodic  assessments based on developments that are publicly known within the insurance industry, to the  Knowledge of NORCAL, no claim or assessment is pending or threatened against NORCAL or  any NORCAL Insurance Subsidiary which is peculiar or unique to NORCAL or such NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiary  by  any  state  insurance  guaranty  association  in  connection  with  such  association&#8217;s fund relating to insolvent insurers.               (j)   Section  5.21(j)  of  the  NORCAL  Disclosure  Schedule  lists  each  actuary,  independent  or  otherwise,  that  has reviewed,  on  behalf  of  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Subsidiary,  the  reserves  for  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses  of  NORCAL  or  any  of  the  NORCAL Insurance Subsidiaries and their premium rates for liability insurance in each of the  years  commencing  after  December  31,  2016  (collectively  the  &#8220;NORCAL  Actuaries&#8221;  and  separately a &#8220;NORCAL Actuary&#8221;).  Section 5.21(j) of the NORCAL Disclosure Schedule lists  each  and  every  actuarial  report,  and  all  attachments,  supplements,  addenda  and  modifications  thereto  prepared  for  or  on  behalf  of  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiary  by  the  NORCAL  Actuaries,  or  delivered  by  the  NORCAL  Actuaries  to  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiary,  since  December  31,  2016,  in  which  a  NORCAL  Actuary  has  (i)  either  expressed an opinion on the adequacy of such reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  or  made  recommendations  as  to  either  the  amount  of  reserves  for  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses that should be maintained by NORCAL or any NORCAL Insurance Subsidiary, or (ii)  expressed an opinion as to the adequacy of such premiums or made a recommendation as to the  premiums  that  should  be  charged  by  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiary  for  liability  insurance  (collectively,  the  &#8220;NORCAL  Actuarial  Analyses&#8221;).   To  the  Knowledge  of  NORCAL  the  information  and  data  furnished  by  NORCAL  or  any  NORCAL  Insurance  Subsidiary to the NORCAL Actuaries in connection with the NORCAL Actuarial Analyses were  accurate  in  all  material  respects.   To  the  Knowledge  of  NORCAL,  each  NORCAL  Actuarial  Analysis  was  based  upon  an  accurate  inventory  of  policies  in  force  for  NORCAL  and  the  NORCAL Insurance Subsidiaries, as the case may be, at the relevant time of preparation, was  prepared  using  appropriate  modeling  procedures  accurately  applied  and  in  conformity with  generally accepted actuarial principles consistently applied, and the projections contained therein  were properly prepared in accordance with the assumptions stated therein.  NORCAL has made  available to PRA a true and correct copy of each of the NORCAL Actuarial Analyses.                                         51  43126503 v1 </FONT></DIV>

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which  shall be deemed an original and all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and  shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered  to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.  A  signed  copy  of  this  Agreement  delivered  by  facsimile,  email  or  other  means  of  electronic  transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of the original signed copy  of this Agreement.         11.10 Entire  Agreement.   This  Agreement  (including  the  documents  and  the  instruments  referred  to  in  this  Agreement)  constitutes  the  entire  agreement  and  supersedes  all  prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the  subject matter of this Agreement.         11.11 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.                 (a)   This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the  laws  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  without  regard  to  any  applicable  conflicts  of  law  principles,  except that the Plan of Conversion shall be effected in accordance with and governed by the laws  of  the  State  of  California,  and  the  insurance  laws  of  the  State  of  California  as  they  relate  to  NORCAL shall govern to the extent the application of such laws would be inconsistent with or in  contravention of the laws of the State of Delaware.                (b)   Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Action with respect  to  this  Agreement  and  the  rights  and  obligations  arising  hereunder,  or  for  recognition  and  enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising  hereunder brought  by  any  other party  hereto  or its  successors or assigns  shall  be brought  and  determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or in the event (but  only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such Action, in  the federal courts located within the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything herein to the  contrary, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Action with respect to any act of  the Commissioner or any other Governmental Authority concerning or arising out of the Plan of  Conversion or any amendment thereto shall be brought and determined exclusively in the state  courts of the State of California in accordance with the Insurance Laws of the State of California.   Each of the parties hereto agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any  such Action in the manner provided in Section 11.3 or in such other manner as may be permitted  by  Applicable  Laws,  will  be  valid  and  sufficient  service  thereof.  Each  of  the  parties  hereto  hereby  irrevocably  submits  with  regard  to  any  such  Action  for  itself  and  in  respect  of  its  property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and  agrees  that  it  will  not  bring  any action  relating  to  this  Agreement  or  any  of  the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in any court or tribunal other than the aforesaid courts. Each of  the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a  defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement and the rights  and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect  of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder: (a) any claim that it is not  personally subject  to  the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any  reason  other than the  failure  to  serve  process  in  accordance  with  this  Section  11.11(b);  (b)  any  claim  that  it  or  its  property  is  exempt  or  immune  from  jurisdiction  of  any  such  court  or  from  any  legal  process                                         83  43126503 v1 </FONT></DIV>

Any  term  or  provision  of  this  Agreement  which  is  invalid  or  unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such  invalidity  or  unenforceability without  rendering  invalid  or  unenforceable  the  remaining  terms  and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or  provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.  If any provision of this Agreement is so  broad  as  to  be  unenforceable,  the  provision  shall  be  interpreted  to  be  only  so  broad  as  is  enforceable.         11.13 Publicity.   PRA  and  NORCAL  shall  develop  a  joint  communications  plan  and  each party shall (i) ensure that all press releases and other public statements and communications  (including any communications that would require a filing under Rule 425, Rule 165 and Rule  166 under the 1933 Act or Rule 14a-2, Rule 14a-12 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act) with  respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such  joint  communications  plan  and  (ii)  unless  otherwise  required  by  Applicable  Law  or  by  obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE, consult with each other  for a reasonable time before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement  or communication (including any communications that would require a filing with the SEC), and  mutually agree upon any such press release or any such public statement or communication, with  respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing,  except to the extent disclosed in the proxy statement, unless otherwise required by Applicable  Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE, neither PRA  nor NORCAL shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure  concerning  the  other  party  or  the  other  party&#8217;s  business,  financial  conditions  or  results  of  operations without the consent of the other party.         11.14 Specific Performance.  Subject to Section 10.5, each party hereto hereby agrees  that, in the event of breach of this Agreement, damages would be difficult, if not impossible, to  ascertain,  that  irreparable  damage  would  occur  in  the event  that  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  their  specific  terms  or  were  otherwise  breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for  any  such  breach.   It  is  accordingly agreed  that,  in  addition  to  and  without  limiting  any  other  remedy or right it may have, each party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable  relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, without any necessity of proving damages or any  requirement for the posting of a bond or other security, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing  specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
