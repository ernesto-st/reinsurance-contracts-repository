Each Note Party  has the organizational power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports  to  own  or  hold  under  lease,  to  transact  the  business  it  transacts  and  proposes  to  transact,  to  execute and deliver each Note Document to which it is a party, and to perform the provisions of  such Note Documents.       Section 5.2.  Authorization, Etc.  Each Note Document has been duly authorized by all  necessary organizational action on the part of each Note Party party thereto, and this Agreement  (with respect to the Company) constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof each other  Note Document to which such Note Party is a party will constitute, a legal, valid and binding  obligation of such Note Party enforceable against such Note Party in accordance with its terms,  except  as  such  enforceability  may  be  limited  by  (i)  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#8217; rights  generally  and  (ii)  general  principles  of  equity  (regardless  of  whether  such  enforceability  is  considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

In the case of each partial prepayment  of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2, the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be  allocated among all of the Notes at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to  the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.

For the purposes of determining the  Make-Whole  Amount,  the  following  terms  have  the  following  meanings:  &#8220;Called  Principal&#8221; means,  with  respect  to  any  Note,  the  principal  of  such  Note  that  is  to  be  prepaid  pursuant  to  Section 8.2  or  has  become  or  is  declared  to  be  immediately  due  and  payable  pursuant  to  Section 12.1, as the context requires.         &#8220;Discounted Value&#8221; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount  obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal  from  their  respective  scheduled  due  dates  to  the  Settlement  Date  with  respect  to  such  Called  Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the  same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment  Yield with respect to such Called Principal.         &#8220;Reinvestment Yield&#8221; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum  of (a) 0.50% plus (b) the yield to maturity implied by the &#8220;Ask Yield(s)&#8221; reported as of 10:00  a.m.  (New  York  City  time)  on  the  second  Business  Day  preceding  the  Settlement  Date  with  respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as &#8220;Page PX1&#8221; (or such other display  as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively  traded  on-the-run  U.S.  Treasury  securities  (&#8220;Reported&#8221;)  having  a  maturity  equal  to  the    52410969                             -20- </FONT></DIV>

If there is no such  U.S.  Treasury  constant  maturity  having  a  term  equal  to  such  Remaining  Average  Life,  such  implied  yield  to  maturity  will  be  determined  by  interpolating  linearly  between  (1)  the  U.S.  Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining  Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and  less than such Remaining Average Life.  The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number  of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.         &#8220;Remaining Average Life&#8221; means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of  years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by  multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to  such  Called  Principal  by  (b) the  number  of  years,  computed  on  the  basis  of  a  360-day  year  comprised  of  twelve  30-day  months  and  calculated  to  two  decimal  places,  that  will  elapse  between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of  such Remaining Scheduled Payment.         &#8220;Remaining Scheduled Payments&#8221; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any  Note,  all  payments  of  such  Called  Principal  and  interest  thereon  that  would  be  due  after  the  Settlement  Date  with  respect  to  such  Called  Principal  if  no  payment  of  such  Called  Principal  were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on  which  interest  payments  are  due  to  be  made  under  the  Notes,  then  the  amount  of  the  next  succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such  Settlement  Date  and  required  to  be  paid  on  such  Settlement  Date  pursuant  to  Section 8.2  or  Section 12.1.         &#8220;Settlement Date&#8221; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on  which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared  to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.    52410969                             -21- </FONT></DIV>

The  Company  will,  within  10  Business Days after any Responsible Officer has knowledge of the occurrence of any Change of  Control or Control Event, give written notice of such Change of Control or Control Event to each  holder of Notes.  In the case that a Change of Control has occurred, such notice shall contain and  constitute an offer to prepay Notes as described in subparagraph (b) of this Section 8.8 and shall  be accompanied by the certificate described in subparagraph (e) of this Section 8.8.        (b)  Offer to Prepay Notes.  The offer to prepay Notes contemplated by subparagraph (a)  of this Section 8.8 shall be an offer to prepay, in accordance with and subject to this Section 8.8,  all, but not less than all, the Notes held by each holder (in this case only, &#8220;holder&#8221; in respect of  any Note registered in the name of a nominee for a disclosed beneficial owner shall mean such  beneficial owner) on a date specified in such offer (the &#8220;Proposed Prepayment Date&#8221;) that is  not less than 10 Business Days and not more than 30 days  after the date of such offer (if the  Proposed Prepayment Date shall not be specified in such offer, the Proposed Prepayment Date  shall be the 30th day after the date of such offer).        (c)  Acceptance;  Rejection.   A  holder  of  Notes  may  accept  the  offer  to  prepay  made  pursuant  to  this  Section 8.8  by  causing  a  notice  of  such  acceptance  to  be  delivered  to  the  Company at least five Business Days prior to the Proposed Prepayment Date. If the offer is so  accepted by any holder of Notes, the Company at least three Business Days prior to the Proposed  Prepayment Date shall give written notice to each holder of Notes that has not so accepted the  offer, in which notice the Company shall (i) state the aggregate outstanding principal amount of  Notes in respect of which the offer has been accepted and (ii) renew the offer and extend the time  for acceptance by stating that any holder of Notes may yet accept the offer, whether theretofore  rejected or not, by causing a notice of such acceptance to be delivered to the Company at least  five  Business  Days  prior  to  the  Proposed  Prepayment  Date,  in  which  case  the  Proposed  Prepayment Date shall be extended to the extent necessary to account for the renewed offer.  A  failure by a holder of Notes to respond to an offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.8  shall be deemed to constitute a rejection of such offer by such holder.        (d)  Prepayment.   Prepayment  of  the  Notes  to  be  prepaid  pursuant  to  this  Section 8.8  shall  be  at  100%  of  the  principal  amount  of  such  Notes  at  par  (without  any  Make-Whole  Amount) together with interest accrued thereon to the prepayment date selected by the Company.   The prepayment shall be made on the Proposed Prepayment Date.    52410969                             -22- </FONT></DIV>
