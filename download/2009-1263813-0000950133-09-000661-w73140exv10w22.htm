<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">covered by this paragraph, Executive shall, on request of the Company, promptly execute a
specific assignment of title to the Company or its Affiliates and do anything else reasonably
necessary to enable the Company or its Affiliates to secure a patent therefore in the United States
and foreign countries.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;COOPERATION: Executive agrees to be available to the Company from time to time to answer
questions or provide information relating to Company matters that he worked on during his
employment at the Company or its Affiliates for a period of six (6)&nbsp;months following his
termination of employment for any reason (the <B>&#147;</B>Cooperation Period&#148;). The Company shall make
reasonable efforts to minimize any burden placed on Executive during the Cooperation Period and
shall not unreasonably interfere in Executive&#146;s obligations to any subsequent employer. In the
event that Executive would reasonably be required to incur any cost or expense to communicate with
the Company or travel to any location requested by the Company, the Company shall advance any such
travel or other costs reasonably incurred by Executive to comply with and perform his obligations
during the Cooperation Period.

(i)&nbsp;the Company and its Affiliates shall be released from any obligation to make payments under
Section &nbsp;9 of this Agreement and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to provide benefits or
make payments under all employee benefit plans in which Executive participates, and (ii)&nbsp;the
Executive shall forfeit to the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to retain, all shares

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;REASONABLENESS OF PROVISIONS: The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the terms set
forth in Sections&nbsp;6 and 7: (i) &nbsp;are reasonable in light of all of the circumstances; (ii)&nbsp;are
sufficiently limited to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii)
impose no undue hardship on the Executive; and (iv)&nbsp;are not injurious to the public. The Executive
further acknowledges and agrees that (x)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s breach of the provisions of Sections&nbsp;6 and
7 will cause the Company irreparable harm, which cannot be adequately compensated by money damages
and which the Company has no adequate remedy in law, and (y)&nbsp;if the Company elects to prevent the
Executive from breaching such provisions by obtaining an injunction against the Executive, there is
a reasonable probability of the Company&#146;s eventual success on the merits. The Executive consents
and agrees that if the Executive commits any such breach or threatens to commit any breach, the
Company shall, in addition to any other remedy available to it and in lieu of Section&nbsp;14 hereof, be
entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief and specific performance in an action from a
court of competent jurisdiction, without posting any bond or other security and without the
necessity of proof of actual damage, in addition to, and not in lieu of, such other remedies as may
be available to the Company for such breach, including the recovery of money damages, the recovery
of its attorneys&#146; fees and costs incurred in doing so, and reimbursement of costs incurred in
securing a qualified replacement as a result of any breach by the Executive.

certificates shall be held in custody by the Company (or its designated agent) until the
restrictions thereon shall have lapsed. Upon the Company&#146;s request, the Participant shall deliver
