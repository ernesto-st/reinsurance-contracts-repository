      If the Senior Debt Rating is not at the same level as the Debt to
      Capitalization Ratio, but no more than one level apart, then the pricing
      shall correspond to the level which causes pricing to be lower. If the
      Senior Debt Rating is more than one level different from the level
      applicable to the Debt to Capitalization Ratio, then the pricing shall be
      one level lower (i.e., lower pricing) than the higher of such two levels.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that either the Moody's or the
      S&P rating of the Borrower's senior unsecured debt is at Level II or
      better, pricing shall correspond to the level of such rating or, if both

      2.1 COMMITMENTS. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower from time to time

Commitment. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

      2.2 LOANS AND BORROWINGS.

            (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing
      consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance
      with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any
      Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its
      obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are
      several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure
      to make Loans as required.

            (b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing shall be
      comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may
      request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan
      or an Index Rate Swingline Loan. Each Lender at its option may make any
      Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of
      such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option
      shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in
      accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement.

            (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
      Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that
      is an integral multiple of

                                       23
<PAGE>

      $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the time that each ABR
      Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
      amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
      $1,000,000; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an
      aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total
      Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC
      Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.6(e). Revolving Borrowings of
      more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, that
      there shall not at an time be more than a total of fifteen (15) Eurodollar
      Revolving Borrowings outstanding.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement,
      the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
      continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect
      thereto would end after the Maturity Date or, if requested prior to an RL
      Maturity Date, would end after such RL Maturity Date.

      2.3 REQUESTS FOR REVOLVING BORROWINGS. To request a Revolving Borrowing,
the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone
(a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than noon three Business
Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than noon on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such
telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.2:

            (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

            (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

            (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
            Eurodollar Borrowing;

            (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest
            Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
            contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

            (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds
            are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of
            Section 2.7.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then
the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with
this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

      than 2:00 p.m. on the date of the requested borrowing of Swingline Loans,
      the Borrower shall provide telephonic notice to the Swingline Lender,
      followed promptly by a written Swingline Loan Request (which may be
      submitted via telecopy), each of such telephonic notice and such written
      Swingline Loan Request setting forth (i) the amount of the requested
      Swingline Loan (which shall not be less than $100,000 and in integral
      multiples of $50,000 in excess thereof), (ii) the date of the requested
      Swingline Loan, (iii) certification that the Borrower has complied in all
      respects with Section 3.2 and, to the extent that the Swingline Loan
      requested is the initial Extension of Credit, Section 3.1 and (iv) whether
      such Swingline Loan is to be an ABR Loan or an Index Rate Swingline Loan
      and, if such Swingline Loan is to be an Index Rate Swingline Loan, the
      applicable Interest Period. If the Borrower has requested an Index Rate
      Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender shall provide to the Borrower no
      later than 2:30 p.m. on the date of such request the Adjusted LIBOR Market
      Index Rate. The Borrower shall notify the Swingline Lender by 3:00 p.m. on
      such date whether it wishes to accept the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index
      Rate. Failure of the Borrower to timely accept the Adjusted LIBOR Market
      Index Rate shall make the request for the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate
      void, and such Swingline Loan shall be made as an ABR Loan. The Swingline
      Lender shall initiate the transfer of funds representing the Swingline
      Loan advance to the Borrower by 4:00 p.m. on the Business Day of the
      requested borrowing.

            (c) Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans. The Borrower
      agrees to repay all ABR Swingline Loans within one Business Day of demand
      therefor by the Swingline Lender and all Swingline Loans that are Index
      Rate Swingline Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period;
      provided that each Swingline Loan shall be repaid within seven Business
      Days from the date of advance but not later than the Maturity Date. Each
      repayment of a Swingline Loan may be accomplished by requesting Revolving
      Loans, which request is not subject to the conditions set forth in Section
      3.2. In the event that the Borrower shall fail to timely repay any
      Swingline Loan, and in any event upon (i) the request of the Swingline
      Lender, (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section
      7.1(f) or (iii) the acceleration of any Loan or termination of any
      Commitment pursuant to Section 7.2, each other Lender shall irrevocably
      and unconditionally purchase from the Swingline Lender, without recourse
      or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such Swingline
      Loan in an amount equal to such other Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof, by
      directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline Loan in such amount
      (regardless of whether the conditions precedent thereto set forth in
      Section 3.2 hereof are then satisfied (provided the Swingline Lender
      believed in good faith that the conditions precedent set forth in Section
      3.2 were satisfied at the time of funding of such Swingline Loan), whether
      or not the Borrower has

                                       25

<PAGE>

      submitted a Borrowing Request and whether or not the Commitments are then
      in effect, any Event of Default exists or all the Loans have been
      accelerated) and paying the proceeds thereof to the Swingline Lender at
      its address specified in or pursuant to Section 9.1, in Dollars and in
      immediately available funds. If such amount is not in fact made available
      to the Swingline Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be
      entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with
      accrued interest thereon (to the extent the Borrower fails to pay accrued
      interest with respect to such amount) for each day from the date of demand
      thereof, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender does not pay
      such amount forthwith upon the Swingline Lender's demand therefore, and
      until such time as such Lender makes the required payment, the Swingline
      Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in
      the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the
      Credit Documents other than those provisions requiring the other Lenders
      to purchase a participation therein. Further, such Lender shall be deemed
      to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on
      its Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder to the Swingline
      Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in
      Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this
      Section 2.4(c) until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such
      assignment or otherwise). On the date the Lenders are required to purchase
      participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section
      2.4(c), the outstanding principal amount, including the Swingline Lender's
      Pro Rata Share, of such Swingline Loans shall be deemed to be an ABR
      Revolving Loan.

            (d) Interest on Swingline Loans. Subject to the provisions of
      Section 2.13, each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate
      equal to the Alternate Base Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate,
      as applicable.

            (e) Swingline Note. The Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by a duly
      executed promissory note of the Borrower to the Swingline Lender in the
      original principal amount of the Swingline Commitment and in substantially
      the form of Exhibit 2.4(e).

      2.5 INCREASE OF AGGREGATE COMMITMENT.

            (a) Request for Increase. The Borrower may, at any time and from
      time to time, request, by notice to the Administrative Agent, the
      Administrative Agent's approval of an increase of the Aggregate Commitment
      ("Facility Increase"), within the limitations hereafter described, which
      request shall set forth the amount of each such requested Facility
      Increase. The Administrative Agent's approval of such request shall not be
      unreasonably withheld. Within twenty (20) days of such request, the
      Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower of its approval or
      disapproval of such request; failure to so advise the Borrower shall
      constitute approval. If the Administrative Agent approves any such
      Facility Increase, then the Aggregate Commitment may be so increased (up
      to the amount of such approved Facility Increase, in the aggregate) by
      having one or more New Lenders increase the amount of their then existing
      Commitments or become Lenders with a new Commitment hereunder, subject to
      and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5. Any Facility
      Increase shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions: (A)
      any increase (in the aggregate) in the Aggregate Commitment and the amount
      (in the aggregate) of any new Commitment of any New Lender or the amount
      (in the aggregate) of any increase in the Commitment of any New Lender,
      shall (unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative
      Agent) not be less than

                                       26

<PAGE>

      $5,000,000 (and shall be in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess
      thereof); (B) no Facility Increase shall increase the Aggregate Commitment
      to an amount in excess of the Maximum Commitment Limit; (C) the Borrower
      and each New Lender shall have executed and delivered a commitment and
      acceptance (the "Commitment and Acceptance") substantially in the form of
      Exhibit 2.5 hereto, and the Administrative Agent shall have accepted and
      executed the same; (D) the Borrower shall have executed and delivered to
      the Administrative Agent such Revolving Notes as the Administrative Agent
      shall require to effect such Facility Increase; (E) the Borrower shall
      have delivered to the Administrative Agent opinions of counsel
      (substantially similar to the forms of opinions delivered pursuant to
      Section 3.1(c), modified to apply to the Facility Increase and each
      Revolving Note and Commitment and Acceptance executed and delivered in
      connection therewith); (F) the Guarantors shall in writing have consented
      to the Facility Increase and have agreed that their Guaranties continue in
      full force and effect and also apply to the Facility Increase; and (G) the
      Borrower and each New Lender shall otherwise have executed and delivered
      such other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall
      have reasonably requested in connection with such Facility Increase. The
      form and substance of the documents required under clauses (A) through (G)
      above shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The
      Administrative Agent shall provide written notice to all of the Lenders
      hereunder of any Facility Increase.

            (b) Loans by New Lenders. Upon the effective date of any Facility
      Increase pursuant to the provisions hereof, which effective date shall be
      mutually agreed upon by the Borrower, each New Lender and the
      Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall repay all outstanding ABR Loans
      and reborrow an ABR Loan in a like amount from the Lenders (including the
      New Lenders), but such New Lenders shall not participate in any then
      outstanding Eurodollar Loan. If the Borrower shall at any time on or after
      such effective date convert or continue any Eurodollar Loan that was
      outstanding on such effective date, the Borrower shall be deemed to repay
      such Eurodollar Loan on the date of the conversion or continuation thereof
      and then to reborrow as a new Revolving Loan a like amount on such date so
      that each New Lender shall advance on such date the amount of its Pro Rata
      Share of such Revolving Loan. Such New Lender shall make its Pro Rata
      Share of all Revolving Loans made on or after such effective date and
      shall otherwise have all of the rights and obligations of a Lender
      hereunder on and after such effective date. To the extent any Eurodollar
      Loan is converted or continued after the effective date of an increase in
      the Aggregate Commitment and prior to the date on which such New Lender
      holds its Pro Rata Share of all Revolving Loans, the amount funded by such
      New Lender as its Pro Rata Share of such converted or continued Loan shall
      be paid ratably to the other Lenders such that all Lenders (including the
      New Lender) hold their Pro Rata Share of such converted or continued Loan.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
      prior to the date on which such New Lender is holding its Pro Rata Share
      of all outstanding Revolving Loans, such New Lender shall immediately (but
      not prior to such effective date) pay to the Administrative Agent (for the
      account of the other Lenders, to which the Administrative Agent shall pay
      their ratable shares thereof upon receipt) a sum equal to such New
      Lender's Pro Rata Share of each outstanding Eurodollar Loan with respect
      to which such New Lender does not then hold its Pro Rata Share; such
      payment by such New Lender shall constitute an ABR Loan by such New Lender
      hereunder.

                                       27

<PAGE>

            (c) New Lenders' Participation in Facility LCs. Upon the effective
      date of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment in accordance with the
      provisions of Section 2.5(b), each New Lender shall also be deemed to have
      irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received, without recourse
      or warranty, from the Lenders party to this Credit Agreement immediately
      prior to the effective date of such increase, an undivided interest and
      participation in all Facility LCs and Reimbursement Obligations (if any)
      then outstanding, ratably, such that each Lender (including each New
      Lender) holds a participation interest in each Facility LC and all
      Reimbursement Obligations (if any) in proportion to the ratio that such
      Lender's Commitment (upon the effective date of such increase in the
      Aggregate Commitment) bears to the Aggregate Commitment as so increased.

            (d) No Obligation to Increase Commitment. Nothing contained herein
      shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment or agreement
      on the part of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to give or grant
      any Lender the right to increase any Commitment hereunder at any time or a
      commitment or agreement on the part of any Lender to increase its
      Commitment hereunder at any time, and no Commitment of a Lender shall be
      increased without its prior written approval.

      2.6 FACILITY LCS.

            (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
      the Borrower may request the issuance of Facility LCs for its own account,
      or may request an Issuing Bank to renew, extend, increase, decrease or
      otherwise modify a Facility LC ("Modify," and each such action, a
      "Modification"), in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
      Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time not later
      than five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. Each Facility LC
      shall be issued in Dollar amounts. In the event of any inconsistency
      between the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement and the terms
      and conditions of any form of any application for a Facility LC or other
      agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower
      with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Facility LC (each, a "Facility LC
      Application"), the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement shall
      control.

            (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
      Conditions. To request the issuance of a Facility LC (or a Modification of
      an outstanding Facility LC), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy
      (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so
      have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank (reasonably in
      advance of the requested date of issuance or Modification) a notice
      requesting the issuance of a Facility LC, or identifying the Facility LC
      to be Modified, and specifying the date of issuance or Modification (which
      shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Facility LC is to expire
      (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of
      such Facility LC, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such
      other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend
      such Facility LC. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also
      shall submit a Facility LC Application on the Issuing Bank's standard form
      in connection with any request for a Facility LC. A Facility LC shall be
      issued or Modified only if (and upon issuance or Modification of each
      Facility LC the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
      after giving effect to such issuance or Modification (i) the LC Exposure
      shall not exceed the Aggregate LC Commitment and (ii) the aggregate

                                       28

<PAGE>

      Revolving Credit Exposure of all Lenders shall not exceed the Aggregate
      Commitment. Upon receipt of a request for issuance (or increase) of a
      Facility LC, the Issuing Bank shall promptly (and in any event prior to
      the issuance (or increase) of such Facility LC) notify the Administrative
      Agent thereof, which notice may be given by fax or e-mail. The issuance or
      Modification by an Issuing Bank of any Facility LC shall, in addition to
      the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 (the satisfaction of
      which the Issuing Bank shall have no duty to ascertain), be subject to the
      conditions precedent that the Issuing Bank shall have received
      confirmation (which may be given by fax or e-mail) from the Administrative
      Agent that the issuance (or Modification) of such Facility LC is in
      compliance with the limitations set forth above in this Section 2.6(b),
      which notice shall be given promptly by the Administrative Agent. Promptly
      following the Administrative Agent's receipt of notice of the issuance or
      Modification of a Facility LC, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
      Lenders, which notice may be by fax or e-mail.

            (c) Expiration Date. Each Facility LC shall expire not later than
      five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

            (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Facility LC (or
      Modification to a Facility LC increasing the amount thereof) and without
      any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the
      Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires
      from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Facility LC (including, as
      of the Effective Date, each Existing Letter of Credit) equal to such
      Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn
      under such Facility LC. In consideration and in furtherance of the
      foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay
      to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such
      Lender's Pro Rata Share of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank
      and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in
      paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to
      be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and
      agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this
      paragraph in respect of Facility LCs is absolute and unconditional and
      shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
      Modification of any Facility LC or the occurrence and continuance of a
      Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the
      Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
      abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

            (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
      Disbursement in respect of a Facility LC, the Borrower shall reimburse
      such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal
      to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date that such LC
      Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
      LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m. on such date, or, if such notice has
      not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then
      not later than 1:00 p.m. on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower
      receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m. on
      the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day
      that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received
      prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that the Borrower may,
      subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in
      accordance with Section 2.3 or 2.4 that such payment be financed with an
      ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to
      the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment
      shall be satisfied by the resulting ABR Revolving

                                       29

<PAGE>

      Borrowing or Swingline Loan; and provided further, that, if such payment
      is so financed, the time by which the Borrower is obligated to make such
      payment shall be deferred to the time at which the ABR Revolving Borrowing
      or Swingline Loan made to finance such payment is advanced. If the
      Borrower fails to make such payment or satisfy the reimbursement
      obligation by an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan as aforesaid
      when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the
      applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in
      respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly
      following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the
      Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due
      from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.7 with
      respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.7 shall apply, mutatis
      mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the
      Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
      received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
      Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
      paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
      Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to
      this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the
      Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender
      pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC
      Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline
      Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not
      relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

            (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
      Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
      absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly
      in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under any and all
      circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
      enforceability of any Facility LC or this Credit Agreement, or any term or
      provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
      Facility LC proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
      any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii)
      payment by the Issuing Bank under a Facility LC against presentation of a
      draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such
      Facility LC, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether
      or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions
      of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide
      a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
      the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of
      their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by
      reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Facility
      LC or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective
      of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any
      error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery
      of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any
      Facility LC (including any document required to make a drawing
      thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
      consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
      provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing
      Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
      (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are
      hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law)
      suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to
      exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
      presented under a Facility LC comply with the terms thereof. The parties
      hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful
      misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally

                                       30

<PAGE>

      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall
      be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In
      furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof,
      the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear
      on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Facility
      LC, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make
      payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
      investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or
      refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents
      are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Facility LC.

            (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
      following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
      represent a demand for payment under a Facility LC. The Issuing Bank shall
      promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone
      (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing
      Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that
      any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the
      Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
      with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

            (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
      Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC
      Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid
      amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the
      date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the
      Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then
      applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to
      reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
      Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to
      this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that
      interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant
      to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be
      for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

            (i) Reports; Quarterly Statements. Each Issuing Bank shall, no later
      than the third (3rd) Business Day following the last day of each month,
      provide to the Administrative Agent a schedule of Facility LCs issued by
      it, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
      Agent, showing the Issuance Date, account party, original face amount (if
      any) paid thereunder, expiration date and the reference number of each
      Facility LC outstanding at any time during each month (and whether such
      Facility LC is a performance Facility LC or financial Facility LC) and the
      aggregate amount (if any) payable by the Borrower to such Issuing Bank
      during the month pursuant to Sections 2.16 and 2.17. Copies of such
      reports shall be provided promptly to each Lender and the Borrower by the
      Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall, with reasonable
      promptness following receipt from all Issuing Banks of the reports
      provided for in this paragraph (i) for the months of March, June,
      September and December, respectively, deliver to the Borrower a quarterly
      statement of the Facility LC Fees and Fronting Fees then due and payable.

            (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
      be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from
      the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
      the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing
      greater than 66-2/3% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit

                                       31

<PAGE>

      of cash collateral pursuant to this subsection, or if required pursuant to
      Section 2.20(a), the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
      Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
      benefit of the Lenders (the "Facility LC Collateral Account"), an amount
      in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and
      unpaid interest thereon (or, in the case of a deposit required pursuant to
      Section 2.20(a), the amount required to be deposited thereunder); provided
      that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective
      immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable,
      without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
      Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.1(f).
      Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for
      the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this
      Credit Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion
      and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the
      Facility LC Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the
      investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option
      and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk
      and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits,
      if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such Facility LC
      Collateral Account. Moneys in such Facility LC Collateral Account shall be
      applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
      Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not
      so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the Reimbursement
      Obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the
      maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
      Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 66-2/3% of the total LC
      Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under
      this Credit Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of
      cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
      Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be
      returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of
      Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide
      an amount of cash collateral pursuant to Section 2.20(a), such amount
      shall be returned to the Borrower from time to time to the extent the
      amount deposited shall exceed the LC Exposure.

      2.7 FUNDING OF BORROWINGS.

            (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on
      the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds
      by 2:00 p.m. to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
      designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that
      Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.4. The
      Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by
      promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account
      of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City
      and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
      provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an
      LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.6(e) shall be remitted by the
      Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

            (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
      a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing (or, in the case of
      an ABR Borrowing, at least 30 minutes prior to the time at which such
      Lender is required to fund its Loan) that such Lender will not make
      available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
      Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
      such share available on such

                                       32

<PAGE>

      date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance
      upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
      amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
      applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
      applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
      Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with
      interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
      made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
      Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of
      the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
      Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
      interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest
      rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the
      Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
      included in such Borrowing.

      2.8 INTEREST ELECTIONS.

            (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type
      specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
      Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as
      specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to
      convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing
      and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest
      Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect
      different options with respect to different portions of the affected
      Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
      among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the
      Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
      Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may
      not be converted or continued.

            (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
      notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
      that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.3 if the
      Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from
      such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such
      telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be
      confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative
      Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the
      Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

            (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
      specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.2:

                  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
            applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
            different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
            each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
            specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be
            specified for each resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
            Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                                       33

<PAGE>

                  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
            Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
            Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
            election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of
            the term "Interest Period."

      If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but
      does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to
      have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

            (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
      Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and
      of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

            (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
      Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end
      of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is
      repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such
      Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any
      contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
      continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required
      Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is
      continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or
      continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
      Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at
      the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

      2.9 TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

            (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on
      the Maturity Date.

            (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
      reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the
      Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
      $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not
      terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any
      concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the
      aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of all Lenders would exceed the
      Aggregate Commitment.

            (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
      election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of
      this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of
      such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective
      date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative
      Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice
      delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
      provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the
      Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness
      of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by
      the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
      specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any
      termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each

                                       34

<PAGE>

      reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in
      accordance with their respective Commitments. The Borrower's rights under
      Section 2.5 shall remain in effect after such reduction of the
      Commitments.

      2.10 REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

            (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the
      Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid
      principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date and (ii) to
      the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline
      Loan as and when provided in Section 2.4(c).

            (b) All payments of principal, interest, fees, expenses and other
      amounts to be made by a Credit Party under this Credit Agreement shall be
      made without setoff, deduction or counterclaim and received not later than
      1:00 p.m. on the date when due, in Dollars and in immediately available
      funds, by the Administrative Agent at its address specified in or pursuant
      to Section 9.1. The Administrative Agent will distribute such payments to
      the applicable Lenders on the same Business Day if any such payment is
      received prior to 1:00 p.m.; otherwise the Administrative Agent will
      distribute such payment to the applicable Lenders not later than the next
      succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to
      be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be
      extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of
      interest and fees for the period of such extension), except that in the
      case of Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be
      made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead
      be made on the next preceding Business Day.

            (c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
      an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
      Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
      of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
      time hereunder.

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
      shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and
      Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount
      of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable
      from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
      received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the
      Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

            (e) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
      paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
      existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that
      the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such
      accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
      obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms
      of this Credit Agreement.

            (f) Any Lender may request that Revolving Loans made by it be
      evidenced by a Revolving Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
      execute and deliver to such Lender a Revolving Note payable to the order
      of such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Revolving Note and
      interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant

                                       35

<PAGE>

      to Section 9.4) be represented by one or more Revolving Notes payable to
      the order of the payee named therein.

      2.11 PREPAYMENT OF LOANS.

            (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
      time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice
      in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

            (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the
      case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone
      (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
      prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.
      three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
      prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m. on the
      date of payment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan,
      not later than 12:00 noon on the date of prepayment. Each such notice
      shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the
      principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
      provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a
      conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by
      Section 2.9, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice
      of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.9. Promptly
      following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing,
      the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.
      Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount
      that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing
      of the same Type as provided in Section 2.2. Each prepayment of a
      Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
      prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to
      the extent required by Section 2.13.

      2.12 FEES.

            (a) Commitment Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
      Administrative Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders, commitment
      fees ("Commitment Fees"), at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable
      Percentage (for Commitment Fees) of the Unused Aggregate Commitment.
      Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date
      and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the
      first such date to occur after the date hereof; notwithstanding the
      definition of "Unused Aggregate Commitment," for purposes of calculation
      of Commitment Fees,Swingline Loans shall constitute usage only of the
      Commitment of the Swingline Lender. All Commitment Fees shall be computed
      on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
      number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
      day).

            (b) Administrative Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
      Administrative Agent, for its own account, administrative fees (the
      "Administrative Fees") in accordance with the terms of the Fee Letter.

            (c) Extension Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
      Agent, for the pro rata benefit of each Extending Lender, at the time of
      any extension of the Maturity Date

                                       36

<PAGE>

      pursuant to Section 2.20, such extension fees as are agreed upon among the
      Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Extending Lenders.

            (d) Upfront Fees. In consideration of the Aggregate Commitment being
      made available by the Lenders hereunder, the Borrower agrees to pay to
      each Lender an upfront fee in accordance with the terms of the Arranger's
      invitation letter to prospective Lenders dated September 29, 2005 (the
      "Upfront Fees"). The Upfront Fees shall be due and payable on or prior to
      the Effective Date.

            (e) Facility LC Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
      Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders, a fee (the "Facility LC
      Fee") with respect to each Facility LC for the period from the Issuance
      Date thereof (or, in the case of the Existing Letters of Credit, the
      Effective Date) to and including the final expiration date thereof, in a
      per annum amount equal to the product, calculated on a daily basis for
      each day during such period, of (A) the undrawn amount of such Facility LC
      for such day multiplied by (B) the Facility LC Fee Rate for such day, less
      0.125% per annum. The Facility LC Fees shall be due and payable quarterly
      in arrears not later than the day ("Quarterly Payment Date") that is five
      (5) Business Days following Administrative Agent's delivery to Borrower of
      the quarterly statement of Facility LC Fees provided for in Section 2.6(i)
      and, to the extent any such fees are then due and unpaid, on the Maturity
      Date. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit such Facility LC Fees,
      when received by the Administrative Agent, to the Lenders (including the
      Issuing Banks) in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares thereof.

            (f) Fronting Fee. The Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative
      Agent, solely for the account of each Issuing Bank, as a Fronting Fee
      ("Fronting Fee"), with respect to each Facility LC issued by such Issuing
      Bank for the period from the Issuance Date thereof (or, in the case of the
      Existing Letters of Credit, the Effective Date) to and including the final
      expiration date thereof, in an amount equal to the product, calculated on
      a daily basis for each day during such period, of (x) the undrawn amount
      of such Facility LC for such day multiplied by (y) 0.125% per annum. The
      Fronting Fees shall also be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the
      date on which Facility LC Fees are payable and, to the extent any Fronting
      Fees are then due and unpaid, on the Maturity Date. The Administrative
      Agent shall promptly remit such Fronting Fee, when received by the
      Administrative Agent, to the applicable Issuing Bank. The Borrower shall
      also pay to the Issuing Bank for its own account documentary and
      processing charges in connection with the issuance or Modification of and
      draws under Facility LCs in accordance with the Issuing Bank's standard
      schedule for such charges as in effect from time to time.

            (g) Payments. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates
      due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for
      distribution (where applicable) to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be
      refundable under any circumstances.

      2.13 INTEREST.

            (a) The Revolving Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing and ABR
      Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.

                                       37

<PAGE>

            (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
      interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for
      such Borrowing plus the Applicable Percentage for Eurodollar Loans.

            (c) Each Index Rate Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the
      Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate applicable to such Loan.

            (d) Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
      Default, upon notice from the Administrative Agent at the direction of the
      Required Lenders (or, in the case of an Event of Default under Section
      7.1(f), automatically without notice or any action) (i) the principal of
      and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the Loans and any other
      amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including
      without limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on
      demand, at a per annum rate equal to two percent (2%) plus the rate which
      would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable, then the rate
      for ABR Revolving Loans plus two percent (2%) per annum) and (ii) the
      Facility LC Fee Rate shall be increased to a per annum rate equal to two
      percent (2%) plus the Facility LC Fee Rate which would otherwise be
      applicable.

            (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
      each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving
      Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest
      accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on
      demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan
      (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the
      Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
      prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and
      (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan
      prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest
      on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

            (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
      of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
      Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate
      shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a
      leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of
      days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The
      applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate, LIBO Rate or LIBOR
      Market Interest Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and
      such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

      2.14 ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. If prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing or the advance of an Index Rate
Swingline Loan (as applicable):

            (a) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which
      determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and
      reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or
      the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period or LIBOR Market
      Interest Rate; or

            (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
      the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest
      Period will not adequately and

                                       38

<PAGE>

      fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or
      maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such
      Interest Period;

      then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower
      and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
      thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and
      the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
      exist, (i) (if and as applicable) any Interest Election Request that
      requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of
      any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective,
      (ii) (if and as applicable) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar
      Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and
      (iii) (if and as applicable) if any Swingline Loan Request requests an
      Index Rate Swingline Loan, such Swingline Loan shall be made as an ABR
      Swingline Loan; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such
      notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of
      Borrowings shall be permitted.

      2.15 INCREASED COSTS.

            (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
            deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or
            for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or the
            Swingline Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in
            the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate (as
            applicable)) or the Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii) impose on any Lender, the Swingline Lender or any Issuing
            Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting
            this Credit Agreement Loans or Fixed Rate made by such Lender, Index
            Rate Swingline Loan made by such Swingline Lender or any Facility LC
            or participation therein;

      and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
      such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of
      maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or the cost to the
      Swingline Lender of making or maintaining any Index Rate Swingline Loan
      (or of maintaining its obligation to make any Index Rate Swingline Loan)
      or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating
      in, issuing or maintaining any Facility LC or to reduce the amount of any
      sum received or receivable by such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing
      Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
      Borrower will pay to such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
      case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
      Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such
      additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

            (b) If any Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank determines that
      any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the
      effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's, Swingline Lender's
      or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing
      Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Credit Agreement
      or the Loans made by, or participations in Facility LCs held by, such
      Lender or

                                       39

<PAGE>

      Swingline Lender, or the Facility LCs issued by such Issuing Bank, to a
      level below that which such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or
      such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company would
      have achieved under the terms of this Agreement but for such Change in Law
      (taking into consideration such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing
      Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or
      Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then
      from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender, Swingline Lender
      or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as
      will compensate such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or such
      Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any
      such reduction suffered.

            (c) A certificate of a Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank
      setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender,
      Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may
      be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be
      delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
      The Borrower shall pay such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as
      the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
      days after receipt thereof.

            (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender, Swingline Lender or
      Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
      constitute a waiver of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's
      right to demand such compensation. Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall not be required to make any
      payments to any Lender, the Swingline Lender, any Issuing Bank or the
      Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section relating to any period of
      time which is greater than 90 days prior to such Person's request for
      additional payment except for retroactive application of such law, rule or
      regulation, in which case the Borrower is required to make such payments
      so long as such Person makes a request therefore within 90 days after the
      public announcement of such retroactive application.

      2.16 BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any
Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then,
in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost
and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such
loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such
event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to
such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the
then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a
comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A

                                       40

certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

      2.17 TAXES.

            (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the
      Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction
      for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower
      shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
      payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
      after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
      additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent,
      Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
      the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
      Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the
      full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
      with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
      relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
      Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
      for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
      Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
      on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of
      the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
      or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and
      any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
      respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were
      correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
      Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
      delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the
      Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the
      Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Any Lender that
      shall become aware of an obligation of the Borrower to pay Taxes or Other
      Taxes in respect of such Lender's Loans or participation in Facility LCs
      shall use good faith efforts to advise the Borrower thereof in a timely
      manner in order to afford the Borrower an opportunity to contest the same
      or to effect the provisions of Section 2.19(b).

            (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
      Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
      shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy
      of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
      payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
      such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

            (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
      reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
      the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
      party, with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement shall deliver
      to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or
      times prescribed

                                       41

<PAGE>

      by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation
      prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as
      will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced
      rate.

            (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole
      discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as
      to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which
      the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it
      shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of
      indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under
      this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
      such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative
      Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by
      the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
      provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent
      or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
      any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
      Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the
      event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
      refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed
      to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its
      tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
      confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

      2.18 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS.

            (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
      hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC
      Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or
      otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date when due, in immediately
      available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received
      after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative
      Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day
      for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be
      made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
      York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
      Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments
      pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.3 shall be made directly to
      the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute
      any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to
      the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any
      payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the
      date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
      and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall
      be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall
      be made in dollars.

            (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
      to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
      unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such
      funds shall be applied in accordance with Section 7.3.

            (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
      counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of
      or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC
      Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving
      payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving
      Loans and

                                       42

<PAGE>

      participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued
      interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then
      the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at
      face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC
      Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary
      so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders
      ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
      accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in
      LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such
      participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
      rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
      purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest,
      and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply
      to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
      express terms of this Credit Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender
      as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
      of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or
      participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
      thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The
      Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
      effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
      participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
      the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
      participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the
      Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
      the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
      Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
      hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
      Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in
      accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute
      to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In
      such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each
      of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees
      to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
      distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each
      day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
      excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater
      of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
      Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
      interbank compensation.

            (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
      by it pursuant to Section 2.4(c), 2.6(d), 2.7(b), 2.18(d) or 9.3(c), then
      the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
      contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
      Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such
      Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied
      obligations are fully paid.

      2.19 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

            (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if
      the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
      Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
      2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
      different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to
      assign

                                       43

<PAGE>

      its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
      or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
      assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
      Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not
      subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
      otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to
      pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection
      with any such designation or assignment.

            (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if
      the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
      Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
      2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder
      or if any Lender is a Refusing Lender under Section 2.20, then the
      Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender
      and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,
      without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
      contained in Section 9.4), all its interests, rights and obligations under
      this Credit Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations
      (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
      assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior
      written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
      unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of
      an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
      participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest
      thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from
      the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
      interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and
      (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
      compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant
      to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
      compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
      assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
      such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
      require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

      2.20 EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE.

            (a) Not more than once each fiscal year of the Borrower, the
      Borrower may, by delivering a written notice to the Administrative Agent,
      request that the Maturity Date be extended for one additional year,
      provided the requested Maturity Date is not more than five (5) years from
      the date of such request. The Administrative Agent shall notify each
      Lender of such request promptly upon its receipt of such notice and shall
      request that each Lender respond to such request by the Borrower within
      sixty (60) days of the Administrative Agent's notice to the Lenders. If
      any Lender does not consent in writing or respond to the Borrower's
      request then such Lender (a "Refusing Lender") shall be deemed to have
      rejected such request. If Lenders whose combined Pro Rata Shares equal at
      least 66-2/3% (the "Extension Required Lenders"; each Lender agreeing to
      extend its Commitment is referred to herein as an "Extending Lender")
      agree in writing within such 60-day period to extend their Commitments,
      and provided that, on the last day of such 60-day period (x) the
      representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties in any Credit
      Document are true and correct in all material respects at and as if made
      as of such date except to the extent they expressly relate to an earlier
      date and (y) no Default or Event of Default shall exist or be continuing
      either prior to or after giving effect thereto and the Borrower deliver to
      the Administrative Agent a certificate so stating, then (i) effective on
      the last day of such 60-day period the Commitments of the Extending
      Lenders shall without further

                                       44

<PAGE>

      action be extended for an additional one-year period, (ii) the term
      "Maturity Date" shall thenceforth mean, (A) as to the Commitments and
      Loans of the Extending Lenders, the last day of such additional one-year
      period and (B) as to the Commitments and Loans of the Refusing Lenders,
      the Maturity Date in effect prior to such extension (each a "RL Maturity
      Date"), (iii) subject to the terms of subsection (b) below, the
      Commitments of the Refusing Lenders shall terminate on the applicable RL
      Maturity Date and the Loans and other amounts owed to such Lenders shall
      be due and payable on such date, (iv) subject to the terms of subsection
      (b) below, on such RL Maturity Date (A) the Aggregate Commitment shall be
      reduced by an amount equal to the sum of the Commitments of the applicable
      Refusing Lenders and (B) the Pro Rata Shares of the Extending Lenders
      shall be reallocated so that the sum of such Pro Rata Shares equals one
      hundred percent (100%) and (v) if the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure
      of all Lenders, after the payment provided for in clause (iii) above,
      exceeds the Aggregate Commitment (as so reduced) (A) the Borrower shall
      pay on such RL Maturity Date Loans in the amount necessary to cause the
      aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of all Lenders to equal but not exceed
      the Aggregate Commitment and (B) if the outstanding Facility LCs exceed
      the Aggregate Commitment (as so reduced), the Borrower shall pay to the
      Administrative Agent on such RL Maturity Date an amount in immediately
      available funds equal to the amount by which the outstanding Facility LCs
      exceed the Aggregate Commitment, which funds shall be held in the Facility
      LC Collateral Account in accordance with and subject to the terms of
      Section 2.6(j). If such extension is not approved in writing by the
      Extension Required Lenders within such 60-day period, the Maturity Date
      then in effect will be retained.

            (b) So long as the Extension Required Lenders consent to the
      extension of the Maturity Date in accordance with the terms of Section
      2.20(a):

                  (i) with respect to any Refusing Lender, the Borrower may, in
            its own discretion, require such Refusing Lender to assign all of
            its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to
            one or more assignees (which may be one or more existing Lenders if
            any existing Lender accepts such assignment subject to and in
            accordance with the provisions of Section 2.19(b)). In such event,
            the maturity date of the Loans transferred to such assignee shall be
            the Maturity Date as extended in accordance with Section 2.20(a)
            above. Such transfer and assignment must occur on or prior to the
            applicable RL Maturity Date; or

                  (ii) the Borrower may (A) notify the Administrative Agent and
            the Extending Lenders in writing that it wishes to (and each such
            Extending Lender shall agree to) reduce the Aggregate Commitment by

      condition has occurred or exists as a result of which any Termination
      Event could reasonably be expected to occur, with respect to any Plan;
      (ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined in

      or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required to indemnify any person
      against any such liability.

            (e) The present value of the liability of the Borrower and its

      meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

            (c) No director, executive officer or principal shareholder of any
      Credit Party is a director, executive officer or principal shareholder of
      any Lender. For the purposes hereof the terms "director", "executive

            furnish or cause to be furnished to the Administrative Agent, at the

            necessary to be in compliance with all Environmental Laws and all
            other applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, rules
            and policies and with the orders and directives of all Governmental
            Authorities exercising jurisdiction over such Real Property to the
            extent any failure would have or could be reasonably expected to

            repurchased, defeased or redeemed (but not including a voluntary
            repayment of such Indebtedness); or (C) any such Indebtedness shall
            mature and remain unpaid.

            (h) Judgments. Any judgment, order, or decree (including, without
      limitation, any judgment, order, or decree with respect to any litigation
      disclosed pursuant to the Credit Documents) shall be entered against any
      one or more of the Credit Parties involving a liability of $25,000,000 or
      more (to the extent not paid or covered by insurance provided by a carrier
      who has acknowledged coverage and in any event not including any
      Non-Recourse Land Financing), and such judgment, order or decree (i) is
      the subject of any enforcement proceeding commenced by any creditor or
      (ii) shall continue unsatisfied, undischarged and unstayed for a period
      ending on the first to occur of (A) the last day on which such judgment,
      order or decree becomes final and unappealable or (B) 30 days.

            (i) ERISA. The occurrence of any of the following events or
      conditions: (A) any "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is
      defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or
      not waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, or any Lien shall arise
      on the assets of any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
      Affiliate in favor of the PBGC or a Plan; (B) a Termination Event shall
      occur with respect to a Single Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable
      opinion of the Administrative Agent, likely to result in the termination
      of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA; (C) a Termination Event
      shall occur with respect to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
      Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent,
      likely to result in (i) the termination of such Plan for purposes of Title
      IV of ERISA, or (ii) any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any
      ERISA Affiliate incurring any liability in connection with a withdrawal
      from, reorganization of (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), or
      insolvency (within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA) of such Plan; or
      (D) any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
      or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of fiduciary responsibility shall
      occur which may subject any Credit Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any
      ERISA Affiliate to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or
      502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or
      other instrument pursuant to which any Credit Party, any of its
      Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required to indemnify
      any person against any such liability.

            (j) Ownership. There shall occur a Change of Control.

      7.2   ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and
at any time thereafter unless and until such Event of Default has been waived in
writing by the Required Lenders (or the Lenders as may be required hereunder),
the Administrative Agent shall, upon the request and direction of the Required
Lenders, by written notice to the Borrower, take the following actions without
prejudice to the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing
Bank to enforce its claims against the Credit Parties, except as otherwise
specifically provided for herein:

            (a) Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments and
      Swingline Commitment terminated whereupon the Commitments and Swingline
      Commitment and the obligation and power of the Issuing Banks to issue or
      Modify Facility LCs shall be immediately terminated.

                                       70
<PAGE>

            (b) Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid principal of and any
      accrued interest in respect of all Loans and any and all other
      indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind owing by a Credit Party
      to any of the Lenders hereunder to be due whereupon the same shall be
      immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other
      notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

            (c) Facility LC Collateral Account. Demand that the Borrower cash
      collateralize the LC Exposure in accordance with Section 2.6(j).

            (d) Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and interests
      created and existing under the Credit Documents, including, without
      limitation, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of
      set-off.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section
7.1(f) shall occur, then (i) the Commitments and Swingline Commitment and the
obligation and power of the Issuing Banks to issue Facility LCs shall
automatically terminate, (ii) all Loans, all accrued interest in respect
thereof, all accrued and unpaid fees and other Credit Party Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable and (iii) the Borrower will also forthwith,
and without any notice or act, cash collateralize the LC Exposure in accordance
with Section 2.6(j), all without the giving of any notice or other action by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders, which notice or other action is expressly
waived by the Borrower.

Notwithstanding the fact that enforcement powers reside primarily with the
Administrative Agent, each Lender has, to the extent permitted by law, a
separate right of payment and shall be considered a separate "creditor" holding
a separate "claim" within the meaning of Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any other insolvency statute.

      7.3   ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.

      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement, after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts
collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of
amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be paid over or
delivered as follows:

            FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
      expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of the
      Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders or Issuing Banks in connection
      with enforcing the rights of the Lenders or Issuing Banks under the Credit
      Documents;

            SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent or
      any Lender or Issuing Bank;

            THIRD, to the payment of all accrued interest payable to the Lenders
      hereunder and all other obligations (other than those obligations to be
      paid pursuant to clause "FOURTH" or clause "FIFTH" below) which shall have
      become due and payable under the Credit Documents and not repaid pursuant
      to clauses "FIRST" and "SECOND" above;

                                       71
<PAGE>

            FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the
      Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, pro rata as set forth below;

            FIFTH, to the Administrative Agent for deposit in the Facility LC
      Collateral Account to the extent of any LC Exposure; and

            SIXTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may be
      lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category and (b) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to
its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans held
by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Loans) of amounts
available to be applied.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

            Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

            The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have
the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such
bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

            The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.2), and (c) except as expressly set forth
herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall
not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the
bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.2) or in the absence of its own gross
negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to
have knowledge of any Default (other than an Event of Default under Section
7.1(a)) unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative
Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any

                                       72
<PAGE>

statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Credit
Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Credit Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

            The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal
counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other
experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or
experts.

            The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent; the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any such appointment. The Administrative
Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its
rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to
the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and
shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as
Administrative Agent.

            Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Such resignation shall not affect the rights or obligations of the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing
Bank. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.3 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

                                       73

            Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Credit
Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or
thereunder.

            None of the Lenders identified in this Credit Agreement as a
Co-Agent, Documentation Agent, Managing Agent or Syndication Agent shall have
any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
Credit Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same
acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the
Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph of this Article VIII.

            Each of the Lenders hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf and to carry out the
responsibilities and exercise the powers afforded the Administrative Agent
therein.

            None of the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to the
benefit of the Borrower or of any Person other than Administrative Agent and
each of the Lenders and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Accordingly, neither the Borrower nor any Person other than Administrative Agent
and the Lenders (and their respective successors and permitted assigns) shall be
entitled to rely upon, or to raise as a defense, the failure of the
Administrative Agent or any Lenders to comply with the provisions of this
Article VIII.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  (ii) if to the Administrative Agent, to JPMorgan Chase Bank,
            N.A., 277 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York 10172, Attention of

            Morgan Loan Servicing, 10 S. Dearborn, 19th Fl., Chicago, IL 60603,

                  (iii) if to the Swingline Lender, to the same address as the
            Administrative Agent; and

                  (iv) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy
            number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

            (b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be
      delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures
      approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall
      not apply to notices pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the
      Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent
      or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other
      communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
      procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may
      be limited to particular notices or communications.

            (c) Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for
      notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties
      hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in
      accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to
      have been given on the date of receipt.

      9.2   WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS.

            (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
      Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall
      operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
      any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
      enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
      thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and
      remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
      hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
      that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Credit
      Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in
      any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b)
      of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
      in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without
      limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance
      or Modification of a Facility LC shall not be construed as a waiver of any
      Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
      Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

            (b) Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor
      any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except
      pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
      Borrower (or other applicable Credit Parties) and the Required Lenders or
      by the Borrower (or other applicable Credit Parties) and the
      Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
      that no such

                                       75
<PAGE>

      agreement shall (i) change the amount of the Commitment of any Lender
      (except as provided in Section 2.9) without the written consent of such
      Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or
      reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees or other amounts
      payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
      thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal
      amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any
      fees or other amounts payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or
      excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of
      any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected
      thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter
      the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written
      consent of each Lender, (v) except as the result of or in connection with
      a merger or other disposition of a Credit Party permitted under Section
      6.4, (A) release the Borrower from its obligations under the Credit
      Agreement or (B) release any Credit Party that individually or, together
      with any other Credit Party previously released or to be released
      simultaneously therewith, cumulatively accounts for more than 5% of
      Tangible Net Worth from its obligations under the Credit Documents, in
      each case without the written consent of each Lender; (vi) consent to the
      assignment or transfer by the Borrower or all or substantially all of the
      other Credit Parties of any of its or their rights and obligations under
      (or in respect of) the Credit Documents except as permitted thereby,
      without the written consent of each Lender; (vii) change any of the
      provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any
      other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
      required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
      determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent
      of each Lender; or (viii) amend the definition of Maximum Commitment Limit
      without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such
      agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
      the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender
      hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
      the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

      9.3   EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER.

            (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
      incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates and payable to
      third parties, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
      counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication
      of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
      administration of this Credit Agreement or any amendments, modifications
      or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions
      contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable
      out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank and payable to third
      parties in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
      of any Facility LC or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all
      out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
      Bank or any Lender and payable to third parties, including the fees,
      charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the
      Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or
      protection of its rights in connection with this Credit Agreement,
      including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans
      made or Facility LCs issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket
      expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in
      respect of such Loans or Facility LCs.

                                       76
<PAGE>

            (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
      Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the
      foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
      and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
      damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and
      disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted
      against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
      of (i) the execution or delivery of this Credit Agreement or any agreement
      or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto
      of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
      transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Facility LC or the use
      of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to
      honor a demand for payment under a Facility LC if the documents presented
      in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of
      such Facility LC), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of
      Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the
      Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability
      related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any
      actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
      relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any
      other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
      provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available
      to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
      expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction have resulted
      from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

            (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required
      to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
      Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
      severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
      the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable
      Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed
      expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided
      that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
      liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
      asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
      Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.

            (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall
      not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
      theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
      damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
      connection with, or as a result of, this Credit Agreement or any agreement
      or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby,
      any Loan or Facility LC or the use of the proceeds thereof.

            (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
      after written demand therefor.

      9.4   SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

            (a) The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon
      and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
      successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an
      Issuing Bank that issues any Facility LC), except that (i) the Borrower
      may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
      hereunder

                                       77
<PAGE>

      without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
      assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null
      and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights
      or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing
      in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
      confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
      successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an
      Issuing Bank that issues any Facility LC), Participants (to the extent
      provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly
      contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative
      Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right,
      remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement.

            (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
      below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
      its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a
      portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the
      prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
      delayed) of:

                  (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower
            shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
            Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and
            is continuing, any other assignee; and

                  (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the
            Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any
            Revolving Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender immediately
            prior to giving effect to such assignment.

                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
            conditions:

                  (A) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
            a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
            obligations under this Credit Agreement;

                  (B) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
            to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together
            with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

                  (C) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
            to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

            For the purposes of this Section 9.4(b), the term "Approved Fund"
has the following meaning:

            "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that
is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar
extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is
administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an
entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
            paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
            specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder
            shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
            by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations
            of a Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender
            thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
            Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under
            this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
            Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
            obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
            be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits
            of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.3 with respect to obligations
            accruing and matters occurring prior to the effective date of such
            assignment). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
            obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with
            this Section 9.4 shall be treated for purposes of this Credit
            Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
            and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

                  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
            agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy
            of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for
            the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
            Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC
            Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
            from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
            shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
            Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
            recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
            hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding
            notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
            inspection by the Borrower, any Lender and Issuing Bank, at any
            reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
            Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
            assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the
            assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
            recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any
            written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this
            Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
            Assumption and record the information contained therein in the
            Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the
            assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made
            by it pursuant to Section 2.4(c), 2.5(c), 2.6(d) or (e), 2.7(b),
            2.18(d) or 9.3(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation
            to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information
            therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have
            been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No
            assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Credit Agreement
            unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
            paragraph.

                  (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower,
            the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender,
            sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a
            "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
            obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion
            of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such
            Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall

                                       79
<PAGE>

            remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to
            the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and
            (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders and
            Issuing Bank shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
            Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under
            this Credit Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
            a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender
            shall retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to
            approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
            this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument
            may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
            Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
            described in the first proviso to Section 9.2(b) that affects such
            Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the
            Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
            benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it
            were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant
            to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law,
            each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section
            9.8 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to
            be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

                  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
            greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable
            Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
            participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
            participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior
            written consent, which consent makes specific reference to this
            Section 9.4(c)(ii). A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if
            it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section
            2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to
            such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
            Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
            interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit
            Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without
            limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
            Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such
            pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such
            pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender
            from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
            or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

            9.5 SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements, representations and
      warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
      instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Credit
      Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other
      parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Credit
      Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Facility LCs,
      regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
      behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank
      or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
      representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder,
      and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or
      any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable
      under this Credit Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Facility LC
      is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or
      terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.3 and
      Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless
      of the consummation of

                                       80
<PAGE>

the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration
or termination of the Facility LCs and the Commitments or the termination of
this Credit Agreement or any provision hereof.

      9.6 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Credit Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Credit Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.1, this Credit Agreement shall become effective when it shall have
been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Credit Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Credit Agreement.

      9.7 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Credit Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

      9.8 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such
Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any
other Credit Party against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower or any
other Credit Party now or hereafter existing under this Credit Agreement or any
other Credit Document held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Credit Agreement or any other
Credit Document and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of
each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

      9.9 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS.

            (a) This Credit Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
      governed by the law of the State of New York.

            (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
      itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
      Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
      United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
      appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out
      of or relating to this Credit Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement
      of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
      unconditionally agrees that all claims in

                                       81
<PAGE>

      respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
      such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal
      court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
      action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
      jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
      law. Nothing in this Credit Agreement shall affect any right that the
      Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to
      bring any action or proceeding relating to this Credit Agreement against
      the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
      the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
      which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
      action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Credit Agreement
      in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the
      parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
      by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
      action or proceeding in any such court.

            (d) Each party to this Credit Agreement irrevocably consents to
      service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.1.
      Nothing in this Credit Agreement will affect the right of any party to
      this Credit Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
      law.

      9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
CREDIT AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

      9.11 HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used
herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Credit
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Credit Agreement.

      9.12 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank
and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party to this Credit Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise
of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
Credit Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the

                                       82
<PAGE>

same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Credit Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or
its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and
its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the
Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information
received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the
Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower
after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.

      9.13 USA PATRIOT ACT. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of
the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26,
2001)) (the "Act") hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the
requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information
that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of
the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the
Borrower in accordance with the Act.

                                INVESTMENT POLICY

                                PULTE HOMES, INC.
                                INVESTMENT POLICY

PURPOSE

This Policy has been adopted by the Board of Directors of Pulte Homes, Inc. (the
"Company") to establish internal rules for the investment of corporate funds.
Investments in accordance with this Policy and changes to Section F may be made
from time to time by, or at the direction of, the Chief Executive Officer, the
Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and/or the Treasurer of the Company. Other
investments or modifications of this Policy may be made only with the prior
approval of the Board of Directors. This Policy does not affect the validity of
existing investments of the Company.

ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

The CFO of the Company shall have principal responsibility and authority for
compliance with this Policy and shall establish suitable internal controls to
assure compliance. The Treasurer is responsible for implementing this Policy.

INVESTMENT POLICY

Responsibilities associated with investment of corporate cash are to be
discharged in such a manner as to protect/maintain the principal involved,
maintain adequate liquidity to fund the Company's anticipated cash requirements
and provide for prudent diversification of risk. The Company's objective is to
maximize the after-tax rate of return on investments consistent with the above
referenced safety, liquidity and diversification guidelines.

A. Surplus Funds

The Treasurer and Director of Treasury Operations (Assistant Treasurer) are
authorized to approve the investment of surplus funds of the Company in approved
money market investments for short-term periods under the guidelines below.
Surplus funds are defined as cash in the Company's accounts which are not
required at that point in time to maintain adequate bank balances or to meet
outstanding financial objectives. Acceptable investments are shown in Exhibit 1.

B. Diversification

To minimize the risk of loss and to promote liquidity, the Company generally
should maintain a reasonable diversity of investments. When investing surplus
funds in non-affiliated entities:

                                        1
<PAGE>

-     No more than $15 million may be invested in any one issuer (other than
      obligations of, or those guaranteed by, the United States of America, U.S.
      government agencies, or U.S. government sponsored enterprises).

-     No more than $50 million may be invested in issuers which are in the same
      or a similar industry (other than banks or other financial institutions).

-     No more than twenty percent (20%) may be invested in whole loan repurchase
      agreements with approved broker/dealers listed in Exhibit 2.

Notwithstanding the above, the Company's only restriction for funds invested
overnight is that they meet the rating criteria shown in Exhibit 1.

C. Maturities

The Company's Treasurer may approve investments with a duration of up to one
year if otherwise in compliance to Exhibit 1. Investments with a duration longer
than 1 year may be made with the prior approval of the Company's CFO.

D. Change in Circumstances

The determination as to whether an investment is permitted under the Policy
shall not be affected due to a change in circumstances occurring after the
investment has been made (e.g., reduction in amount of surplus funds;
downgrading of rating of a particular issuer). Upon a change in circumstances,
the Treasurer will investigate the events which precipitated the change and will
determine whether or not to terminate the investment. The Company shall not
roll-over or otherwise renew or extend an investment if such investment would
not then be permitted under this Policy.

E. Hedging

Any investment in fixed income securities with a duration greater than one year
must be hedged with an appropriate instrument executed with a financial
institution maintaining a minimum Moody's A3 credit rating (or equivalent) in
order to protect the principal amount of the investment unless the CEO and CFO
jointly allow for a specific exception. The Company's CFO and Treasurer are
responsible for developing an appropriate hedge strategy.

F. Selection of Approved Broker/Dealers, Mutual Fund Companies and Banks

Any additions, deletions or other changes to the list of approved
broker/dealers, mutual fund companies and banks (Exhibits 2 and 3) must be
approved in writing by at least two of the officers below:

-     Chief Executive Officer

-     Chief Financial Officer

-     Treasurer

                               SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY

      THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY (this "Guaranty") is made as of October 31, 2005,
by the undersigned (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors") in favor of the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, under the Credit Agreement
referred to below.

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, Pulte Homes, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the "Principal"), and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a national banking association having its principal
office in New York, New York, as Administrative Agent, and certain other Lenders
from time to time party thereto have entered into a certain Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement dated October 31, 2005 (as same may be amended or
modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), providing, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, for extensions of credit to be made by the Lenders
to the Principal;

      WHEREAS, the Credit Agreement requires that each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors execute and deliver this Guaranty whereby each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors shall guarantee the payment when due, subject to Section 10 hereof,
of all Guaranteed Obligations, as defined below; and

      WHEREAS, in consideration of the financial and other support that the
Principal has provided, and such financial and other support as the Principal
may in the future provide, to the Subsidiary Guarantors, and because each
Subsidiary Guarantor has determined that executing this Guaranty is in its
interest and to its financial benefit, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is
willing to guarantee the obligations of the Principal under the Credit
Agreement, any Note and the other Credit Documents;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

      1. Defined Terms. "Guaranteed Obligations" is defined in Section 4 below.
Other capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the
meaning set forth in the Credit Agreement.

      2. Representations and Warranties. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors
represents and warrants (which representations and warranties shall be deemed to
have been renewed upon each Extension of Credit under the Credit Agreement)
that:

      (a) It (i) is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state (or
other jurisdiction) of its organization, (ii) is duly qualified and in good
standing as a foreign entity and authorized to do business in every jurisdiction
unless the failure to be so qualified, in good standing or authorized would not
have or could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(iii) has the requisite power and authority to own its properties and to carry
on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted.

                                        6
<PAGE>

      (b) It (i) has the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform this Guaranty and any other Credit Document to which it is a party and
to incur the obligations herein and therein provided for and (ii) is duly
authorized to, and has been authorized by all necessary action, to execute,
deliver and perform this Guaranty and any other Credit Document to which it is a
party.

      (c) Neither the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor performance of and
compliance with the terms and provisions thereof by it (i) violate or conflict
with any provision of its articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws,
(ii) violate, contravene or materially conflict with any Requirement of Law or
any other law, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D, O, T, U
or X), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or permit applicable to it,
(iii) violate, contravene or conflict with contractual provisions of, or cause
an event of default under, any indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, deed of
trust, contract or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by
which it may be bound, the violation of which would have or could be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) result in or require the
creation of any Lien (other than those contemplated in or created in connection
with the Credit Documents) upon or with respect to its properties.

      (d) Except for consents, approvals and authorizations which have been
obtained, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing,
registration or qualification with, any court or Governmental Authority or third
party is required in connection with its execution, delivery or performance of
this Guaranty and any other Credit Agreement to which it is a party.

      3. Covenants. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors covenants that, so long as
any Lender has any Commitment outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any of
the Guaranteed Obligations shall remain unpaid, that it will, and, if necessary,
will enable the Principal to, fully comply with those covenants and agreements
set forth in the Credit Agreement.

      4. The Guaranty. Subject to Section 10 hereof, each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor
and not as surety, the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity,
upon acceleration or early termination or otherwise, and at all times
thereafter) and performance of the Credit Party Obligations, including without
limitation any such Credit Party Obligations incurred or accrued during the
pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar
proceeding, whether or not allowed or allowable in such proceeding
(collectively, subject to the provisions of Section 10 hereof, being referred to
as the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Upon failure by the Principal to pay
punctually any such amount, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that it
shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates, the amount not so paid at the
place and in the manner specified in the Credit Agreement, any Note or the
relevant Credit Document, as the case may be. This Guaranty is a guaranty of
payment and not of collection. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors waives any
right to require the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to sue the Principal,
any other guarantor, or any other person obligated for all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise to enforce its payment against any
collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.

      5. Guaranty Unconditional. Subject to Section 10 hereof, the obligations
of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be unconditional and
absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be
released, discharged or otherwise affected by:

                                        7
<PAGE>

            (a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
      release in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of
      law or otherwise, or any obligation of any other guarantor of any of the
      Guaranteed Obligations, or any default, failure or delay, willful or
      otherwise, in the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations;

            (b) any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Credit
      Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document;

            (c) any release, nonperfection or invalidity of any direct or
      indirect security for any obligation of the Principal under the Credit
      Agreement, any Note, any Collateral Document, any other Credit Document,
      or any obligations of any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed
      Obligations, or any action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent,
      any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender with respect to any collateral
      securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;

            (d) any change in the corporate or other legal existence, structure
      or ownership of the Principal or any other guarantor of any of the
      Guaranteed Obligations, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
      other similar proceeding affecting the Principal, or any other guarantor
      of the Guaranteed Obligations, or its assets or any resulting release or
      discharge of any obligation of the Principal, or any other guarantor of
      any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

            (e) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which the
      Subsidiary Guarantors may have at any time against the Principal, any
      other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Administrative
      Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or
      any unrelated transactions;

            (f) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to any other
      guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, for any reason related to
      the Credit Agreement, any Note on any other Credit Document, or any
      provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the
      payment by any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, of the
      principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount payable under the
      Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Credit Document; or

            (g) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the
      Principal, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, the
      Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other
      circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this
      paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any Subsidiary
      Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subsidiary Guarantors do not waive defenses
to the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to the Principal, except for
such defenses as may arise by reason of any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding affecting the Principal.

      6. Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full: Reinstatement In Certain
Circumstances. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations hereunder shall
remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments under the Credit Agreement shall
have terminated or expired. If at any time any payment of the principal of or
interest on any Note or any other amount payable by the Principal or any other
party under the Credit

                                        8
<PAGE>

Agreement or any other Credit Document is rescinded or must be otherwise
restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
Principal or otherwise, each of the Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder
with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been
due but not made at such time.

      7. Waivers. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors irrevocably waives
acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement
that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Principal, any
other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other Person.

      8. Subrogation. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees not to
assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a
claim for subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or otherwise, against the
Principal arising out of or by reason of this Guaranty or the obligations
hereunder, including, without limitation, the payment or securing or purchasing
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations by any of the Subsidiary Guarantors unless
and until the Guaranteed Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full, and any
commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement and any other Credit Documents is
terminated or has expired.

      9. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Principal, all such amounts otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other
Credit Document shall nonetheless be payable by each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made at the
request of the Required Lenders.

      10. Limitation on Obligations. The provisions of this Guaranty are
severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or
any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any
Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined
to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such
Subsidiary Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability
shall, without any further action by the Subsidiary Guarantors, the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, be automatically limited and reduced to the
highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or
proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the relevant
Subsidiary Guarantor's "Maximum Liability"). This Section 10(a) with respect to
the Maximum Liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors is intended solely to
preserve the rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder to the maximum extent
not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and neither the Subsidiary
Guarantor nor any other person or entity shall have any right or claim under
this Section 10(a) with respect to the Maximum Liability, except to the extent
necessary so that the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall
not be rendered voidable under applicable law.

            (a) Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that the Guaranteed
      Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum
      Liability of each Subsidiary Guarantor, and may exceed the aggregate
      Maximum Liability of all other Subsidiary Guarantors, without impairing
      this Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative
      Agent hereunder. Nothing in this Section 10(b) shall be construed to
      increase any Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder beyond its
      Maximum Liability.

                                        9
<PAGE>

            (b) In the event any Subsidiary Guarantor (a "Paying Subsidiary
      Guarantor") shall make any payment or payments under this Guaranty or
      shall suffer any loss as a result of any realization upon any collateral
      granted by it to secure its obligations under this Guaranty, each other
      Subsidiary Guarantor (each a "Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor") shall
      contribute to such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor an amount equal to such
      Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's "Pro Rata Share" of such payment or
      payments made, or losses suffered, by such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor.
      For the purposes hereof, each Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's "Pro Rata
      Share" with respect to any such payment or loss by a Paying Subsidiary
      Guarantor shall be determined as of the date on which such payment or loss
      was made by reference to the ratio of (i) such Non-Paying Subsidiary
      Guarantor's Maximum Liability as of such date (without giving effect to
      any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder)
      or, if such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's Maximum Liability has not
      been determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such
      Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor from the Principal after the date hereof
      (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means) to (ii) the
      aggregate Maximum Liability of all Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder
      (including such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor) as of such date (without
      giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any
      contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not
      been determined for any Subsidiary Guarantors, the aggregate amount of all
      monies received by such Subsidiary Guarantors from the Principal after the
      date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means). Nothing
      in this Section 10(c) shall affect any Subsidiary Guarantor's several
      liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to such

imposed by any government or any political or taxing authority thereof
(excluding federal taxation of the overall income of any Lender), provided,
however, that if any of the Subsidiary Guarantors is required by law to make
such deduction or withholding, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall forthwith (i) pay
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, such additional amount
as results in the net amount received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender,

Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, had no such deduction or
withholding been made, (ii) pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iii) furnish to the
