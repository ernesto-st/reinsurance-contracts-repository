         On each Adjustment Date (as hereinafter defined), the Applicable Margin
Percentage  for all Loans and the  Commitment  Fee  payable  pursuant to Section

at any



                                       3
<PAGE>

time the Borrower  shall have failed to deliver the financial  statements  and a
Compliance  Certificate as required by Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b),  as the
case may be, and  Section  5.2(a),  or if at any time an Event of Default  shall
have occurred and be continuing,  then at the election of the Required  Lenders,
at all times from and including the date on which such statements and Compliance
Certificate  are required to have been  delivered  (or the date of occurrence of
such Event of  Default,  as the case may be) to the date on which the same shall
have been  delivered (or such Event of Default cured or waived,  as the case may
be), each Applicable  Margin  Percentage  shall be determined in accordance with
the  above  matrix  as  if  the  Leverage   Ratio  were  equal  to  2.5  to  1.0
(notwithstanding  the actual Leverage  Ratio).  For purposes of this definition,
"Adjustment  Date" shall mean, with respect to any fiscal period of the Borrower
beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2001, the fifth (5th) day (or,

the  case  may be,  of (i)  financial  statements  as of the end of and for such
fiscal period and (ii) a duly completed  Compliance  Certificate with respect to
such fiscal period.  Until the first  Adjustment  Date, each  Applicable  Margin
Percentage  shall be determined  in  accordance  with the above matrix as if the
Leverage Ratio were greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.5 to 1.0
(notwithstanding the actual Leverage Ratio).

         "Asset Disposition" shall mean any sale, assignment,  transfer or other
disposition  by the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  to any other  Person
(other than to the  Borrower or to a Wholly  Owned  Subsidiary),  whether in one
transaction  or in a  series  of  related  transactions,  of any of its  assets,
business units or other properties (including any interests in property, whether
tangible or intangible, and including Capital Stock of Subsidiaries),  excluding
the sale or exchange of used or obsolete equipment to the extent the proceeds of
such sale are applied  towards,  or such equipment is exchanged for,  similar or
substitute replacement equipment.

conditions  of this  Agreement,  to make loans (each,  a  "Revolving  Loan," and
collectively,  the "Revolving Loans") to the Borrower,  from time to time on any
Business  Day during the period from and  including  the Closing Date to but not
including  the Revolving  Credit  Termination  Date,  in an aggregate  principal
amount at any time outstanding not greater than its Revolving Credit Commitment,
provided  that no  Borrowing of  Revolving  Loans shall be made if,  immediately
after giving effect thereto,  the sum of (x) the aggregate  principal  amount of
Revolving Loans outstanding at such time, and (y) the aggregate principal amount
of Swingline Loans  outstanding at such time (excluding the aggregate  amount of
any Swingline  Loans to be repaid with proceeds of Revolving Loans made pursuant
to such Borrowing) would exceed the aggregate  Revolving  Credit  Commitments at
such time.  Subject to and on the terms and  conditions of this  Agreement,  the
Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

         (c)      The Swingline  Lender agrees,  subject to and on the terms and
conditions  of this  Agreement,  to make loans (each,  a  "Swingline  Loan," and
collectively,  the "Swingline Loans") to the Borrower,  from time to time on any
Business  Day during the period from the Closing Date to but not  including  the
Swingline Maturity Date (or, if earlier, the Revolving Credit Termination Date),
in an aggregate  principal  amount at any time  outstanding  not  exceeding  the
Swingline  Commitment,  notwithstanding  that the aggregate  principal amount of
Swingline Loans  outstanding at any time, when added to the aggregate  principal
amount of the Revolving Loans made by the Swingline  Lender in its capacity as a
Lender  outstanding at such time, may exceed its Revolving Credit  Commitment at
such time,  but provided that no Borrowing of Swingline  Loans shall be made if,
immediately after giving effect thereto,  the sum of (x) the aggregate principal
amount of  Revolving  Loans  outstanding  at such  time,  and (y) the  aggregate
principal  amount of Swingline  Loans  outstanding at such time would exceed the
aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments at such time. Subject to and on the terms
and conditions of this Agreement,



                                       20
<PAGE>

the Borrower may borrow,  repay  (including by means of a Borrowing of Revolving
Loans pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) and reborrow Swingline Loans.

         2.2 Borrowings.

         (a)      The Term Loans and  Revolving  Loans (each,  together with the
Swingline  Loans,  a "Class" of Loan)  shall,  at the option of the Borrower and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be either Base Rate Loans
or LIBOR Loans (each, a "Type" of Loan),  provided that (i) all Loans comprising
the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise  specifically  provided herein, be of
the same  Type,  and (ii) no  Borrowing  of LIBOR  Loans may be made at any time
prior to the third (3rd)  Business  Day after the Closing  Date.  The  Swingline
Loans shall be made and maintained as Base Rate Loans at all times.

         (b)      In order to make a  Borrowing  (other than (x)  Borrowings  of
Swingline Loans,  which shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2(d), (y) Borrowings
for the  purpose of  repaying  Refunded  Swingline  Loans,  which  shall be made
pursuant  to Section  2.2(e),  and (z)  Borrowings  involving  continuations  or
conversions of outstanding Loans, which shall be made pursuant to Section 2.11),
the Borrower will give the  Administrative  Agent written  notice not later than
11:00 a.m.,  Charlotte time,  three (3) Business Days prior to each Borrowing to
be comprised of LIBOR Loans and one (1) Business Day prior to each  Borrowing to
be  comprised  of Base Rate Loans;  provided,  however,  that  requests  for the
Borrowing  of the Term Loans and any  Revolving  Loans to be made on the Closing
Date may, at the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be given later than the
times  specified  hereinabove.  Each such notice (each, a "Notice of Borrowing")
shall be  irrevocable,  shall be given  in the  form of  Exhibit  B-1 and  shall
specify (1) the aggregate principal amount,  Class and initial Type of the Loans
to be made pursuant to such  Borrowing,  (2) in the case of a Borrowing of LIBOR
Loans,  the  initial  Interest  Period  to be  applicable  thereto,  and (3) the
requested  date of such  Borrowing  (the  "Borrowing  Date"),  which  shall be a
Business  Day.  Upon its receipt of a Notice of  Borrowing,  the  Administrative
Agent  will   promptly   notify   each   Lender  of  the   proposed   Borrowing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

                  (i)      the  aggregate  principal  amount of the Borrowing of
         Term  Loans  shall  be  in  the  amount  of  the  aggregate  Term  Loan
         Commitments;

                  (ii)     the  aggregate  principal  amount  of each  Borrowing
         comprised of Base Rate Loans shall not be less than  $1,000,000  or, if
         greater, an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (or, in the
         case of a Borrowing of Revolving  Loans,  if less, in the amount of the
         aggregate Unutilized  Revolving Credit Commitments),  and the aggregate
         principal  amount of each Borrowing  comprised of LIBOR Loans shall not
         be less than  $3,000,000  or,  if  greater,  an  integral  multiple  of
         $1,000,000 in excess thereof;

                  (iii)    if the Borrower  shall have failed to  designate  the
         Type of Loans  comprising a Borrowing,  the Borrower shall be deemed to
         have requested a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Loans; and



                                       21
<PAGE>

                  (iv)     if the  Borrower  shall  have  failed to  select  the
         duration of the Interest  Period to be  applicable  to any Borrowing of
         LIBOR  Loans,  then the  Borrower  shall be deemed to have  selected an
         Interest Period with a duration of one month.

         (c)      Not later than 1:00 p.m.,  Charlotte  time,  on the  requested
Borrowing Date, each Lender will make available to the  Administrative  Agent at
its  office  referred  to in  Section  10.5 (or at such  other  location  as the
Administrative  Agent may  designate) an amount,  in Dollars and in  immediately
available  funds,  equal to the  amount  of the Loan or Loans to be made by such
Lender.  To the extent  the  Lenders  have made such  amounts  available  to the
Administrative Agent as provided hereinabove, the Administrative Agent will make
the  aggregate of such amounts  available  to the  Borrower in  accordance  with
Section 2.3(a) and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

         (d)      In order to make a Borrowing of a Swingline Loan, the Borrower
will give the  Administrative  Agent and the Swingline Lender written notice not
later than 11:00 a.m.,  Charlotte  time, on the Business Day of such  Borrowing.
Each such notice (each, a "Notice of Swingline Borrowing") shall be irrevocable,
shall be given in the form of Exhibit B-2 and shall  specify  (i) the  principal
amount of the Swingline Loan to be made pursuant to such Borrowing  (which shall
be in an  integral  multiple  of  $100,000  (or,  if less,  in the amount of the
Unutilized  Swingline  Commitment)) and (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, which
shall be a  Business  Day.  Not later  than 1:00 p.m.,  Charlotte  time,  on the
requested  Borrowing  Date,  the  Swingline  Lender will make  available  to the
Administrative Agent at its office referred to in Section 10.5 (or at such other
location as the Administrative Agent may designate) an amount, in Dollars and in
immediately  available  funds,  equal to the amount of the  requested  Swingline
Loan. To the extent the Swingline  Lender has made such amount  available to the
Administrative Agent as provided hereinabove, the Administrative Agent will make
such amount  available to the Borrower in accordance  with Section 2.3(a) and in
like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

         (e)      With respect to any outstanding Swingline Loans, the Swingline
Lender may at any time  (whether or not an Event of Default has  occurred and is
continuing) in its sole and absolute  discretion,  and is hereby  authorized and
empowered by the  Borrower  to, cause a Borrowing of Revolving  Loans to be made
for  the  purpose  of  repaying  such  Swingline  Loans  by  delivering  to  the
Administrative  Agent  (if  the  Administrative  Agent  is  different  from  the
Swingline  Lender) and each other  Lender (on behalf of, and with a copy to, the
Borrower), not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte time, one (1) Business Day prior
to the proposed Borrowing Date therefor, a notice (which shall be deemed to be a
Notice of  Borrowing  given by the  Borrower)  requesting  the  Lenders  to make
Revolving  Loans  (which  shall be made  initially  as Base Rate  Loans) on such
Borrowing  Date in an  aggregate  amount  equal to the amount of such  Swingline
Loans (the "Refunded  Swingline  Loans")  outstanding on the date such notice is
given that the Swingline Lender requests to be repaid. Not later than 1:00 p.m.,
Charlotte  time, on the requested  Borrowing  Date,  each Lender (other than the
Swingline Lender) will make available to the Administrative  Agent at its office
referred to in Section  10.5 (or at such other  location  as the  Administrative
Agent may designate) an amount,  in Dollars and in immediately  available funds,
equal to the  amount of the  Revolving  Loan to be made by such  Lender.  To the
extent the Lenders have made such amounts available to the Administrative  Agent
as provided



                                       22
<PAGE>

hereinabove,  the  Administrative  Agent will make the aggregate of such amounts
available   to  the   Swingline   Lender  in  like  funds  as  received  by  the
Administrative  Agent,  which  shall  apply  such  amounts in  repayment  of the
Refunded Swingline Loans. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,   on  the  relevant  Borrowing  Date,  the  Refunded  Swingline  Loans
(including the Swingline  Lender's  ratable share thereof,  in its capacity as a
Lender)  shall be deemed to be repaid with the proceeds of the  Revolving  Loans
made as provided  above  (including a Revolving Loan deemed to have been made by
the Swingline Lender),  and such Refunded Swingline Loans deemed to be so repaid
shall no longer be  outstanding  as Swingline  Loans but shall be outstanding as
Revolving  Loans.  If any  portion  of any such  amount  repaid (or deemed to be
repaid)  to the  Swingline  Lender  shall be  recovered  by or on  behalf of the
Borrower  from the  Swingline  Lender in any  bankruptcy,  insolvency or similar
proceeding  or  otherwise,  the loss of the amount so recovered  shall be shared
ratably among all the Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.15(b).

         (f)      If,  as a result  of any  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  similar
proceeding  with respect to the Borrower,  Revolving Loans are not made pursuant
to subsection (e) above in an amount sufficient to repay any amounts owed to the
Swingline  Lender in  respect  of any  outstanding  Swingline  Loans,  or if the
Swingline  Lender is otherwise  precluded for any reason from giving a notice on
behalf of the Borrower as provided for  hereinabove,  the Swingline Lender shall
be deemed to have sold without recourse,  representation  or warranty,  and each
Lender  shall be deemed to have  purchased  and  hereby  agrees to  purchase,  a
participation  in such  outstanding  Swingline  Loans in an amount  equal to its
ratable  share (based on the  proportion  that its Revolving  Credit  Commitment
bears to the aggregate  Revolving Credit Commitments at such time) of the unpaid
amount thereof  together with accrued  interest  thereon.  Upon one (1) Business
Day's  prior  notice from the  Swingline  Lender,  each  Lender  (other than the
Swingline Lender) will make available to the Administrative  Agent at its office
referred to in Section  10.5 (or at such other  location  as the  Administrative
Agent may designate) an amount,  in Dollars and in immediately  available funds,
equal to its respective participation.  To the extent the Lenders have made such
amounts  available  to the  Administrative  Agent as provided  hereinabove,  the
Administrative  Agent will make the  aggregate of such amounts  available to the
Swingline Lender in like funds as received by the  Administrative  Agent. In the
event any such Lender fails to make  available to the  Administrative  Agent the
amount of such Lender's  participation  as provided in this  subsection (f), the
Swingline  Lender  shall be entitled to recover  such amount on demand from such
Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is
required to be made available for the account of the Swingline  Lender until the
date such amount is made available to the Swingline  Lender at the Federal Funds
Rate for the first three (3) Business  Days and  thereafter at the Adjusted Base
Rate  applicable  to  Revolving  Loans.  Promptly  following  its receipt of any
payment by or on behalf of the  Borrower  in respect of a  Swingline  Loan,  the
Swingline  Lender  will pay to each  Lender  that has  acquired a  participation
therein such Lender's ratable share of such payment.

         (g)      Notwithstanding   any  provision  of  this  Agreement  to  the
contrary,  the  obligation of each Lender  (other than the Swingline  Lender) to
make Revolving  Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded  Swingline  Loans
pursuant to subsection (e) above and each such Lender's obligation to purchase a
participation  in any unpaid  Swingline  Loans  pursuant to subsection (f) above
shall  be  absolute  and   unconditional  and  shall  not  be  affected  by  any
circumstance  or  event  whatsoever,  including,  without  limitation,  (i)  any
set-off,  counterclaim,



                                       23
<PAGE>

recoupment,  defense  or other  right  that such  Lender  may have  against  the
Swingline Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or any other Person for
any reason  whatsoever,  (ii) the  occurrence or  continuance  of any Default or
Event  of  Default,  (iii)  any  adverse  change  in the  business,  operations,
properties,  assets,  condition  (financial  or  otherwise)  or prospects of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any
party hereto.

         2.3 Disbursements; Funding Reliance; Domicile of Loans.

         (a)      The Borrower  hereby  authorizes the  Administrative  Agent to
disburse the  proceeds of each  Borrowing  in  accordance  with the terms of any
written  instructions  from any of the  Authorized  Officers,  provided that the
Administrative  Agent shall not be obligated under any  circumstances to forward
amounts to any account not listed in an Account Designation Letter. The Borrower
may at any time  deliver  to the  Administrative  Agent an  Account  Designation
Letter  listing any  additional  accounts or deleting any  accounts  listed in a
previous Account Designation Letter.

         (b)      Unless the  Administrative  Agent has received,  prior to 1:00
p.m.,  Charlotte  time, on the relevant  Borrowing  Date,  written notice from a
Lender that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
Lender's ratable portion, if any, of the relevant Borrowing,  the Administrative
Agent  may  assume  that such  Lender  has made such  portion  available  to the
Administrative  Agent in immediately  available  funds on such Borrowing Date in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.2, and the Administrative
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but shall not be obligated to, make
a corresponding  amount available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date. If and
to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the
Administrative  Agent,  and  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  made  such
corresponding  amount available to the Borrower,  such Lender,  on the one hand,
and the Borrower,  on the other,  severally  agree to pay to the  Administrative
Agent  forthwith on demand such  corresponding  amount,  together  with interest
thereon for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower
until the date such  amount is repaid to the  Administrative  Agent,  (i) in the
case of such  Lender,  at the Federal  Funds  Rate,  and (ii) in the case of the
Borrower,  at the rate of interest applicable at such time to the Type and Class
of Loans  comprising  such  Borrowing,  as  determined  under the  provisions of
Section  2.8.  If such  Lender  shall  repay to the  Administrative  Agent  such
corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of
such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. The failure of any Lender to make
any Loan  required to be made by it as part of any  Borrowing  shall not relieve
any other Lender of its obligation,  if any,  hereunder to make its Loan as part
of such  Borrowing,  but no Lender shall be  responsible  for the failure of any
other  Lender  to make the Loan to be made by such  other  Lender as part of any
Borrowing.  The Administrative  Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower
after  it  obtains  knowledge  that a  Lender  will  not  make  funds  available
hereunder.

         (c)      Each Lender may, at its option, make and maintain any Loan at,
to or for the account of any of its Lending Offices,  provided that any exercise
of such option  shall not affect the  obligation  of the  Borrower to repay such
Loan to or for the account of such Lender in  accordance  with the terms of this
Agreement.

issued  after the  Closing  Date,  dated the  effective  date of the  applicable
Assignment and  Acceptance),  (iv) be in a stated principal amount equal to such
Lender's Term Loan  Commitment  (or, in the case of a Term Note issued after the

as the same may be  applicable  from  time to time to the Term Loan made by such
Lender,  and (vi) be entitled to all of the benefits of this  Agreement  and the
other Credit Documents and subject to the provisions hereof and thereof.

         (c)      Each Revolving Note issued to a Lender with a Revolving Credit
Commitment  shall (i) be executed by the Borrower,  (ii) be payable to the order
of such  Lender,  (iii) be dated as of the  Closing  Date (or,  in the case of a
Revolving  Note issued after the Closing Date,  dated the effective  date of the
applicable  Assignment and  Acceptance),  (iv) be in a stated  principal  amount
equal  to such  Lender's  Revolving  Credit  Commitment,  (v) bear  interest  in

be  entitled  to all of the  benefits  of this  Agreement  and the other  Credit
Documents and subject to the provisions hereof and thereof.

         (e)      Each Lender will record on its internal records the amount and
Type of each Loan made by it and each payment  received by it in respect thereof
and will,  in the event of any transfer of any of its Notes,  either  endorse on
the reverse side thereof or on a schedule  attached thereto (or any continuation
thereof)  the  outstanding  principal  amount  and Type of the  Loans  evidenced
thereby as of the date of transfer or provide such  information on a schedule to
the Assignment and Acceptance relating to such transfer; provided, however, that
the  failure of any  Lender to make any such  recordation  or  provide  any such
information,  or any error therein,  shall not affect the Borrower's obligations
under this Agreement or the Notes.

         2.5 Termination and Reduction of Commitments and Swingline Commitment.

         (a)      The  Term  Loan  Commitments   shall  be   automatically   and
permanently  terminated on the Closing Date (or, if earlier, on April 30, 2001),
unless  the Term  Loans  have  been made in



                                       25
<PAGE>

full on or  prior  to such  date.  The  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  shall be
automatically  and permanently  terminated on the Revolving  Credit  Termination
Date (or on April 30, 2001, but only if the Closing Date shall not have occurred
on or prior to such date). The Swingline  Commitment shall be automatically  and
permanently  terminated on the Swingline Maturity Date, unless sooner terminated
pursuant to any other provision of this Section or Section 8.2.

         (b)      The  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  shall,  on each date upon
which a prepayment of the Loans is required under any of subsections (d) and (e)
of Section 2.6 (and  exceeds in amount the  aggregate  principal  amount of Term
Loans  then   outstanding)  or  would  be  required  if  Term  Loans  were  then
outstanding,  be automatically and permanently reduced by the amount, if any, by
which the amount of such  required  prepayment  (determined  as if an  unlimited
amount of Term Loans were then  outstanding)  exceeds  the  aggregate  principal
amount of Term Loans then actually  outstanding,  as more particularly set forth
in Section 2.6(f).

         (c)      At any time and from time to time after the date hereof,  upon
not less than five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative
Agent  (and,  in the  case  of a  termination  or  reduction  of the  Unutilized
Swingline Commitment, the Swingline Lender), the Borrower may terminate in whole
or reduce in part the aggregate  Unutilized  Revolving Credit Commitments or the
Unutilized Swingline Commitment,  provided that any such partial reduction shall
be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 ($1,000,000 in the case of
the Unutilized  Swingline  Commitment) or, if greater,  an integral  multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess  thereof.  The amount of any  termination or reduction made
under this subsection (c) may not thereafter be reinstated.

         (d)      Each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to
this  Section  shall be applied  ratably  among the Lenders  according  to their
respective  Revolving Credit Commitments.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary,  any reduction of the  Revolving  Credit  Commitments
pursuant to this Section that has the effect of reducing the aggregate Revolving
Credit Commitments to an amount less than the amount of the Swingline Commitment
at such  time  shall  result  in an  automatic  corresponding  reduction  of the
Swingline Commitment to the amount of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments
(as so reduced),  without any further  action on the part of the Borrower or the
Swingline Lender.

         2.6 Mandatory Payments and Prepayments

         (a)      Except  to the  extent  due or  paid  sooner  pursuant  to the

         (b)      Except  to the  extent  due or  paid  sooner  pursuant  to the
provisions of this  Agreement,  (i) the aggregate  outstanding  principal of the
Term Loans shall be due and payable in full on the Term Loan Maturity Date, (ii)
the  aggregate  outstanding  principal of the  Revolving  Loans shall be due and
payable in full on the Revolving  Credit  Maturity Date, and (iii) the aggregate
outstanding principal of the Swingline Loans shall be due and payable in full on
the Swingline Maturity Date.

         (c)      In the event that,  at any time,  the sum of (x) the aggregate
principal  amount of  Revolving  Loans  outstanding  at such  time,  and (y) the
aggregate   principal  amount  of  Swingline  Loans  outstanding  at  such  time
(excluding  the  aggregate  amount  of any  Swingline  Loans to be  repaid  with
proceeds of Revolving Loans made on the date of determination)  shall exceed the
aggregate  Revolving Credit Commitments at such time (after giving effect to any
concurrent  termination  or reduction  thereof),  the Borrower will  immediately
prepay the  outstanding  principal  amount of the  Swingline  Loans and,  to the
extent of any excess remaining after prepayment in full of outstanding Swingline
Loans, the Borrower will immediately prepay the outstanding  principal amount of
the Revolving Loans in the amount of such excess.

         (d)      Promptly  upon  (and  in any  event  not  later  than  two (2)
Business  Days  after)  its  receipt  thereof,  the  Borrower  will  prepay  the
outstanding  principal  amount of the Loans in an amount equal to 25% of the Net
Cash  Proceeds  from any Equity  Issuance and 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from
any Debt Issuance,  and will deliver to the Administrative  Agent,  concurrently
with such  prepayment,  a  certificate  signed  by a  Financial  Officer  of the
Borrower in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the  Administrative  Agent and
setting forth the calculation of such Net Cash Proceeds.

         (e)      The  Borrower  will (i)  promptly  upon  (and in any event not
later  than two (2)  Business  Days  after)  its  receipt  thereof,  prepay  the
outstanding  principal  amount of the  Loans in an  amount  equal to 100% of the
excess of the Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Disposition over $5,000,000,  and
(ii) within five (5)  Business  Days after the end of any month in which the Net
Cash  Proceeds  from Asset  Dispositions  exceeds the  amounts set forth  below,
prepay the outstanding  principal amount of the Loans in an amount equal to 100%
of the  excess  of the Net Cash  Proceeds  from any Asset  Disposition  over (x)
together with the aggregate of the Net Cash Proceeds from all Asset Dispositions
occurring within the 365-day period immediately preceding such Asset Disposition
(but specifically  excluding,  if applicable,  any Asset Dispositions  occurring
prior to the Closing Date),  $10,000,000,  or (y) together with the aggregate of
the Net Cash Proceeds from all Asset  Dispositions  occurring  after the Closing
Date,  $25,000,000,  whichever  is greater.  The  Borrower  will  deliver to the
Administrative Agent, concurrently with



                                       27
<PAGE>

such prepayment,  a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower in
form and substance  satisfactory to the  Administrative  Agent and setting forth
the  calculation  of such  Net Cash  Proceeds.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
nothing in this subsection  shall be deemed to permit any Asset  Disposition not
expressly permitted under Section 7.4.

         (f)      Each  prepayment of the Loans made pursuant to subsections (d)
and (e) above shall be applied (i) first,  to reduce the  outstanding  principal
amount of the Term Loans,  with such  reduction  to be applied to the  scheduled
principal payments on the Term Loans (as set forth in subsection (a) above) on a
pro rata  basis,  (ii)  second,  to the  extent of any  excess  remaining  after
application as provided in clause (i) above, to reduce the outstanding principal
amount of the Swingline Loans,  with a corresponding  reduction to the Revolving
Credit Commitments as provided in Section 2.5(b), and (iii) third, to the extent
of any excess  remaining  after  application as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans, with a
corresponding  reduction  to the  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  as provided in
Section 2.5(b).  Within each Class of Loans, each payment or prepayment shall be
applied first to prepay all Base Rate Loans, and any excess shall, at the option
of the Borrower,  be applied to prepay any LIBOR Loans of such Class immediately
and/or  deposited in a separate  Prepayment  Account (as defined  below) for the
Loans of such Class. The Administrative  Agent shall apply any cash deposited in
the  Prepayment  Account  for any Class of Loans to prepay  LIBOR  Loans of such
Class on the last day of their respective Interest Periods (or, at the direction
of the  Borrower,  on any earlier  date),  in  ascending  order of length of the
remaining portion of their then current Interest Periods,  until all outstanding
Loans of such Class have been prepaid or until the allocable  cash on deposit in
the Prepayment  Account for such Class has been exhausted.  For purposes of this
Agreement,  "Prepayment  Account"  for any Class of Loans  shall mean an account
established  by the Borrower  with the  Administrative  Agent and over which the
Administrative  Agent shall have exclusive  dominion and control,  including the
exclusive  right of withdrawal for  application in accordance  with this Section
2.6(f).  The Administrative  Agent will, at the request of the Borrower,  invest
amounts  on  deposit in the  Prepayment  Account  for any Class of Loans in Cash
Equivalents that mature prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Periods
of the LIBOR Loans of such Class to be prepaid; provided,  however, that (i) the
Administrative  Agent shall not be required to make any investment  that, in its
sole business judgment,  would require or cause the  Administrative  Agent to be
in, or would result in any, violation of law, statute,  rule or regulation,  and
(ii) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the selection
of such investments shall be in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent.
Other than interest earned on such  investments,  the Prepayment  Accounts shall
not bear interest.  Interest or profits,  if any, on such  investments  shall be
deposited in the applicable  Prepayment  Account and reinvested and disbursed as
set forth above. If the maturity of the Loans has been  accelerated  pursuant to
Article VIII, the  Administrative  Agent may, in its sole discretion,  apply all
amounts on deposit in the  Prepayment  Account for any Class of Loans to satisfy
any of the  Obligations  related  to such  Class of Loans  (provided  that  such
amounts shall be applied first to prepay all outstanding  Base Rate Loans).  The
Borrower hereby pledges and assigns to the Administrative Agent, for its benefit
and the benefit of the Lenders, each Prepayment Account established hereunder to
secure  the  Obligations  related  to such  Class  of  Loans.  Each  payment  or
prepayment of a LIBOR Loan made pursuant to the  provisions of this Section on a
day other than the last day of the Interest Period  applicable  thereto shall be
made  together  with all amounts  required  under  Section  2.18 to be paid as a
consequence thereof.

         (g)      Each payment or  prepayment  of a LIBOR Loan made  pursuant to
the  provisions of this Section on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto shall be made together with all amounts required under
Section 2.18 to be paid as a consequence thereof.

         (h)      Each payment or prepayment  pursuant to the provisions of this
Section  shall be applied  ratably  among the  Lenders  holding  the Loans being
prepaid, in proportion to the principal amount held by each.

         2.7 Voluntary Prepayments.

         (a)      At any time and from time to time, the Borrower shall have the
right to prepay  the  Loans,  in whole or in part,  without  premium  or penalty
(except as provided in clause (iii)  below),  upon  written  notice given to the
Administrative  Agent  not later  than  11:00  a.m.,  Charlotte  time,  five (5)
Business  Days  prior to each  intended  prepayment  of LIBOR  Loans and one (1)
Business Day prior to each intended prepayment of Base Rate Loans, provided that
(i) each partial  prepayment  shall be in an aggregate  principal  amount of not
less than $1,000,000 or, if greater,  an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess
thereof (an integral multiple of $100,000 in the case of Swingline Loans),  (ii)
no partial prepayment of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to any single Borrowing shall
reduce the aggregate  outstanding  principal amount of the remaining LIBOR Loans
under such  Borrowing to less than  $3,000,000  or to any greater  amount not an
integral  multiple  of  $1,000,000  in excess  thereof,  and (iii)  unless  made
together  with  all  amounts  required  under  Section  2.18  to  be  paid  as a
consequence of such prepayment, a prepayment of a LIBOR Loan may be made only on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable  thereto.  Each such notice shall
specify the proposed date of such prepayment and the aggregate principal amount,
Class and Type of the Loans to be prepaid (and, in the case of LIBOR Loans,  the
Interest  Period  of the  Borrowing  pursuant  to  which  made),  and  shall  be
irrevocable  and shall bind the  Borrower to make such  prepayment  on the terms
specified  therein.  Revolving  Loans and  Swingline  Loans (but not Term Loans)
prepaid pursuant to this subsection (a) may be reborrowed,  subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

         (b)      Each  prepayment of the Term Loans made pursuant to subsection
(a) above  shall be applied to reduce the  outstanding  principal  amount of the
Term  Loans,  with such  reduction  to be  applied  to the  scheduled  principal
payments on the Term Loans (as set forth in Section 2.6(a)) on a pro rata basis.
Each  prepayment  of the Loans made  pursuant to  subsection  (a) above shall be
applied ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans being prepaid, in proportion
to the principal amount held by each.

         2.8 Interest.

         (a)      The  Borrower  will pay  interest  in  respect  of the  unpaid
principal  amount of each Loan,  from the date of Borrowing  thereof  until such
principal amount shall be paid in full, (i) at the Adjusted Base Rate applicable
to the Class of such Loan, as in effect from time to time during such periods as
such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, and (ii) at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate applicable to
the Class of such Loan,  as in effect from time to time  during such  periods as
such Loan is a LIBOR Loan.



                                       29

         (b)      Upon the occurrence and during the  continuance of any default
by the Borrower in the payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan,  any
fees or other  amount  hereunder  when due  (whether  at  maturity,  pursuant to
acceleration or otherwise),  and (at the election of the Required  Lenders) upon
the  occurrence  and  during  the  continuance  of any  Event  of  Default,  all
outstanding principal amounts of the Loans and, to the greatest extent permitted
by law, all interest  accrued on the Loans and all other accrued and outstanding
fees and other amounts hereunder,  shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to the  interest  rate  applicable  from time to time  thereafter  to such Loans
(whether the Adjusted Base Rate or the Adjusted  LIBOR Rate) plus 2% (or, in the
case of fees and other  amounts,  at the Adjusted  Base Rate  applicable  to the
Loans plus 2%),  and, in each case,  such default  interest  shall be payable on
demand.  To the greatest  extent  permitted by law,  interest  shall continue to
accrue after the filing by or against the  Borrower of any petition  seeking any
relief in bankruptcy or under any law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief.

         (c)      Accrued (and theretofore  unpaid) interest shall be payable as
follows:

                  (i)      in respect of each Base Rate Loan (including any Base
         Rate Loan or portion thereof paid or prepaid pursuant to the provisions
         of Section 2.6, except as provided hereinbelow), in arrears on the last
         Business Day of each calendar  quarter,  beginning  with the first such
         day to occur after the Closing  Date;  provided,  that in the event the
         Loans  are  repaid or  prepaid  in full and the  Commitments  have been
         terminated,  then  accrued  interest  in respect of all Base Rate Loans
         shall be payable together with such repayment or prepayment on the date
         thereof;

                  (ii)     in respect of each  LIBOR Loan  (including  any LIBOR
         Loan or portion  thereof paid or prepaid  pursuant to the provisions of
         Section  2.6,  except as provided  hereinbelow),  in arrears (y) on the
         last Business Day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (subject to
         the provisions of clause (iv) in Section 2.10) and (z) in addition,  in
         the case of a LIBOR Loan with an Interest  Period  having a duration of
         six months or longer,  on each date on which  interest  would have been
         payable under clause (y) above had successive Interest Periods of three
         months' duration been applicable to such LIBOR Loan; provided,  that in
         the event all LIBOR  Loans  made  pursuant  to a single  Borrowing  are
         repaid or prepaid in full,  then  accrued  interest  in respect of such
         LIBOR Loans shall be payable together with such repayment or prepayment
         on the date thereof; and

                  (iii)    in respect of any Loan, at maturity (whether pursuant
         to acceleration or otherwise) and, after maturity, on demand.

         (d)      Nothing  contained  in this  Agreement  or in any other Credit
Document  shall be deemed to establish or require the payment of interest to any
Lender at a rate in excess of the maximum rate  permitted by applicable  law. If
the amount of interest  payable  for the  account of any Lender on any  interest
payment date would exceed the maximum  amount  permitted by applicable law to be
charged by such Lender,  the amount of interest  payable for its account on such
interest payment date shall be automatically reduced to such maximum permissible
amount. In the event of any such reduction affecting any Lender, if from time to
time thereafter the amount of interest payable for the account of such Lender on
any  interest  payment date would be



                                       30
<PAGE>

less than the maximum  amount  permitted by applicable law to be charged by such
Lender,  then the amount of interest  payable for its account on such subsequent
interest  payment  date  shall  be  automatically   increased  to  such  maximum
permissible amount, provided that at no time shall the aggregate amount by which
interest paid for the account of any Lender has been increased  pursuant to this
sentence exceed the aggregate  amount by which interest paid for its account has
theretofore been reduced pursuant to the previous sentence.

         (e)      The  Administrative  Agent shall promptly  notify the Borrower
and the Lenders upon  determining  the interest rate for each Borrowing of LIBOR
Loans  after  its  receipt  of the  relevant  Notice of  Borrowing  or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation,  and  upon  each  change  in the Base  Rate;  provided,
however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent to provide the Borrower or
the Lenders with any such notice shall  neither  affect any  obligations  of the
Borrower or the Lenders hereunder nor result in any liability on the part of the
Administrative  Agent to the  Borrower  or any Lender.  Each such  determination
(including each determination of the Reserve Requirement) shall, absent manifest
error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

         2.9 Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay:

         (a)      To First Union Securities,  Inc., for its own account,  on the
date of execution of this Agreement,  the fees described in paragraph (1) of the
Fee Letter, in the amounts set forth therein as due and payable on such date and
to the extent not theretofore paid to it;

         (b)      To First Union,  for the ratable  benefit of the Lenders,  the
fees  described  in  paragraph  (2) of the Fee Letter,  in the amounts set forth
therein as due and payable on such date and to the extent not  theretofore  paid
to it;

         (c)      To the  Administrative  Agent,  for the account of each Lender
with a Revolving Credit Commitment,  a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") for
each calendar  quarter (or portion thereof) for the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, at a per annum rate equal to
the Applicable Margin Percentage in effect for such fee from time to time during
such quarter,  on such Lender's  ratable share (based on the proportion that its
Revolving Credit Commitment bears to the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments)
of the average daily aggregate Unutilized Revolving Credit Commitments,  payable
in arrears (i) on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter, beginning with
the first such day to occur after the Closing  Date,  and (ii) on the  Revolving
Credit Termination Date; and

         (d)      To the Administrative  Agent, for its own account,  the annual
administrative  fee described in paragraph (3) of the Fee Letter,  on the terms,
in the amount and at the times set forth therein.

         2.10  Interest  Periods.  Concurrently  with the  giving of a Notice of
Borrowing  or Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  in  respect  of any  Borrowing
(whether in respect of Term Loans or  Revolving  Loans)  comprised  of Base Rate
Loans to be converted into, or LIBOR Loans to be continued as, LIBOR Loans,  the
Borrower  shall have the right to elect,  pursuant to such notice,  the interest
period (each, an "Interest  Period") to be applicable to such LIBOR Loans, which



                                       31
<PAGE>

Interest  Period shall,  at the option of the Borrower,  be a one, two, three or
six-month period; provided, however, that:

                  (i)      all LIBOR Loans  comprising a single  Borrowing shall
         at all times have the same Interest Period;

                  (ii)     the initial  Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan shall
         commence on the date of the Borrowing of such LIBOR Loan (including the
         date of any  continuation of, or conversion into, such LIBOR Loan), and
         each  successive  Interest  Period  applicable to such LIBOR Loan shall
         commence  on the  day on  which  the  next  preceding  Interest  Period
         applicable thereto expires;

                  (iii)    LIBOR  Loans may not be  outstanding  under more than
         six (6) separate  Interest  Periods at any one time (for which  purpose
         Interest  Periods  shall  be  deemed  to be  separate  even if they are
         coterminous);

                  (iv)     if any Interest  Period  otherwise  would expire on a
         day that is not a Business Day,  such  Interest  Period shall expire on
         the next succeeding  Business Day unless such next succeeding  Business
         Day falls in another calendar month, in which case such Interest Period
         shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

                  (v)      no Interest  Period may be selected  with  respect to
         the Term Loans that would end after a scheduled  date for  repayment of
         principal of the Term Loans occurring on or after the first day of such
         Interest  Period  unless,  immediately  after  giving  effect  to  such
         selection,  the aggregate  principal amount of Term Loans that are Base
         Rate Loans or that have  Interest  Periods  expiring  on or before such
         principal  repayment  date  equals  or  exceeds  the  principal  amount
         required to be paid on such principal repayment date;

                  (vi)     the Borrower may not select any Interest  Period that
         begins prior to the third (3rd)  Business Day after the Closing Date or
         that  expires (y) after the Term Loan  Maturity  Date,  with respect to
         Term Loans that are to be maintained  as LIBOR Loans,  or (z) after the
         Revolving  Credit  Maturity Date,  with respect to Revolving Loans that
         are to be maintained as LIBOR Loans;

                  (vii)    if any  Interest  Period  begins  on a day for  which
         there is no numerically  corresponding day in the calendar month during
         which such Interest Period would otherwise expire, such Interest Period
         shall expire on the last Business Day of such calendar month; and

                  (viii)   no Interest  Period shall commence for any LIBOR Loan
         (including a conversion of, or continuation  into, a LIBOR Loan) on any
         day on which there are Swingline Loans outstanding.

         2.11 Conversions and Continuations.

         (a)      The  Borrower  shall  have  the  right,  on any  Business  Day
occurring on or after the Closing Date, to elect (i) to convert all or a portion
of the  outstanding  principal  amount of any



                                       32
<PAGE>

Base Rate Loans of any Class into LIBOR Loans of the same  Class,  or to convert
any LIBOR Loans of any Class the Interest  Periods for which end on the same day
into Base Rate  Loans of the same  Class,  or (ii)  upon the  expiration  of any
Interest  Period,  to  continue  all or a portion of the  outstanding  principal
amount of any LIBOR Loans of any Class the Interest Periods for which end on the
same  day  for an  additional  Interest  Period,  provided  that  (w)  any  such
conversion  of LIBOR  Loans into Base Rate  Loans  shall  involve  an  aggregate
principal  amount  of not less  than  $1,000,000  or, if  greater,  an  integral
multiple of $500,000 in excess  thereof;  any such conversion of Base Rate Loans
into,  or  continuation  of, LIBOR Loans shall  involve an  aggregate  principal
amount of not less than  $3,000,000  or, if  greater,  an  integral  multiple of
$1,000,000  in excess  thereof;  and no partial  conversion  of LIBOR Loans made
pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding  principal amount of
such  LIBOR  Loans to less  than  $3,000,000  or to any  greater  amount  not an
integral  multiple of  $1,000,000  in excess  thereof,  (x) except as  otherwise
provided in Section  2.16(d),  LIBOR Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans
only on the last day of the Interest  Period  applicable  thereto  (and,  in any
event,  if a LIBOR Loan is converted into a Base Rate Loan on any day other than
the last day of the Interest Period applicable  thereto,  the Borrower will pay,
upon such  conversion,  all amounts  required under Section 2.18 to be paid as a
consequence thereof),  (y) no such conversion or continuation shall be permitted
with  regard  to any Base  Rate  Loans  that  are  Swingline  Loans,  and (z) no
conversion  of Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans or  continuation  of LIBOR Loans
shall be permitted during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default.

         (b)      The  Borrower  shall  make each such  election  by giving  the
Administrative  Agent written notice not later than 11:00 a.m.,  Charlotte time,
three (3) Business Days prior to the intended  effective  date of any conversion
of Base Rate Loans into,  or  continuation  of, LIBOR Loans and one (1) Business
Day prior to the intended  effective  date of any conversion of LIBOR Loans into
Base Rate Loans. Each such notice (each, a "Notice of  Conversion/Continuation")
shall be  irrevocable,  shall be given  in the  form of  Exhibit  B-3 and  shall
specify  (x) the  date of such  conversion  or  continuation  (which  shall be a
Business Day), (y) in the case of a conversion into, or a continuation of, LIBOR
Loans,  the Interest  Period to be  applicable  thereto,  and (z) the  aggregate
amount,  Class and Type of the Loans  being  converted  or  continued.  Upon the
receipt of a Notice of  Conversion/Continuation,  the Administrative  Agent will
promptly notify each Lender of the proposed  conversion or continuation.  In the
event    that   the    Borrower    shall   fail   to   deliver   a   Notice   of
Conversion/Continuation as provided herein with respect to any outstanding LIBOR
Loans, such LIBOR Loans shall automatically be converted to Base Rate Loans upon
the expiration of the then current  Interest Period  applicable  thereto (unless
repaid  pursuant  to the terms  hereof).  In the event the  Borrower  shall have
failed  to select in a Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  the  duration  of the
Interest  Period to be applicable to any conversion  into, or  continuation  of,
LIBOR  Loans,  then the  Borrower  shall be deemed to have  selected an Interest
Period with a duration of one month.

         2.12 Method of Payments; Computations.

         (a)      All payments by the Borrower  hereunder  shall be made without
setoff,  counterclaim or other defense, in Dollars and in immediately  available
funds to the  Administrative  Agent,  for the account of the Lenders entitled to
such payment or the  Swingline  Lender,  as the case may be (except as otherwise
expressly  provided  herein as to payments  required to be made  directly to the
Lenders)  at its  office  referred  to in  Section  10.5,  prior to

12:00 noon,  Charlotte  time,  on the date  payment is due.  Any payment made as
required  hereinabove,  but after 12:00 noon, Charlotte time, shall be deemed to
have been made on the next succeeding  Business Day. If any payment falls due on
a day that is not a Business  Day,  then such due date shall be  extended to the
next  succeeding  Business  Day (except that in the case of LIBOR Loans to which
the  provisions  of clause (iv) in Section  2.10 are  applicable,  such due date
shall be the next preceding Business Day), and such extension of time shall then
be included in the computation of payment of interest,  fees or other applicable
amounts.

         (b)      The  Administrative  Agent will distribute to the Lenders like
amounts relating to payments made to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lenders as follows:  (i) if the payment is received by 12:00 noon, Charlotte
time,  in  immediately  available  funds,  the  Administrative  Agent  will make
available  to each  relevant  Lender  on the  same  date,  by wire  transfer  of
immediately  available funds, such Lender's ratable share of such payment (based
on the percentage  that the amount of the relevant  payment owing to such Lender
bears to the total amount of such payment owing to all of the relevant Lenders),
and (ii) if such payment is received  after 12:00 noon,  Charlotte  time,  or in
other than  immediately  available  funds,  the  Administrative  Agent will make
available to each such Lender its ratable share of such payment by wire transfer
of immediately  available funds on the next  succeeding  Business Day (or in the
case of uncollected  funds,  as soon as  practicable  after  collected).  If the
Administrative  Agent  shall  not  have  made  a  required  distribution  to the
appropriate  Lenders as required  hereinabove  after receiving a payment for the
account of such Lenders,  the Administrative Agent will pay to each such Lender,
on demand,  its  ratable  share of such  payment  with  interest  thereon at the
Federal  Funds Rate for each day from the date such  amount was  required  to be
disbursed by the Administrative Agent until the date repaid to such Lender.

         (c)      Unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have received  written
notice  from the  Borrower  prior to the date on which any payment is due to any
Lender hereunder that such payment will not be made in full, the  Administrative
Agent  may  assume  that the  Borrower  has  made  such  payment  in full to the
Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
on such  assumption,  but shall not be obligated to, cause to be  distributed to
such  Lender on such due date an  amount  equal to the  amount  then due to such
Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in
full to the  Administrative  Agent,  and without  limiting the obligation of the
Borrower to make such payment in accordance  with the terms hereof,  such Lender
shall  repay to the  Administrative  Agent  forthwith  on demand  such amount so
distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the
date such amount is so  distributed  to such Lender until the date repaid to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

         (d)      All  computations  of interest and fees  hereunder  (including
computations  of the Reserve  Requirement)  shall be made on the basis of a year
consisting  of 365 or 366  days,  as the case  may be (in the case of Base  Rate
Loans),  or 360 days (in all other  instances),  and the  actual  number of days
(including the first day, but excluding the last day) elapsed.

         2.13 Recovery of Payments.

         (a)      The Borrower  agrees that to the extent the  Borrower  makes a
payment or  payments to or for the  account of the  Administrative  Agent or any
Lender,  which  payment  or



                                       34
<PAGE>

payments  or any part  thereof  are  subsequently  invalidated,  declared  to be
fraudulent  or  preferential,  set aside or  required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar state or
federal law, common law or equitable cause,  then, to the extent of such payment
or  repayment,  the  Obligation  intended to be  satisfied  shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been received.

         (b)      If any amounts distributed by the Administrative  Agent to any
Lender are subsequently  returned or repaid by the  Administrative  Agent to the
Borrower or its representative or successor in interest,  whether by court order
or by settlement approved by the Lender in question,  such Lender will, promptly
upon  receipt  of  notice  thereof  from  the  Administrative   Agent,  pay  the
Administrative  Agent such  amount.  If any such  amounts are  recovered  by the
Administrative  Agent from the  Borrower or its  representative  or successor in
interest, the Administrative Agent will redistribute such amounts to the Lenders
on the same basis as such amounts were originally distributed.

         2.14 Use of  Proceeds.  The  proceeds  of the  Loans  shall be used (i)
first,  to  consummate  the  amendment and  restatement  of the Original  Credit
Agreement  as set forth  herein,  (ii) second,  to pay or  reimburse  reasonable
transaction fees and expenses in connection with the closing of the transactions
contemplated  hereby,  and (iii)  thereafter,  for  working  capital and general
corporate  purposes  and in  accordance  with the terms and  provisions  of this
Agreement  (including to finance  Permitted  Acquisitions in accordance with the
terms and  provisions of this  Agreement,  including,  without  limitation,  the
provisions set forth in Section 5.8).

         2.15 Pro Rata Treatment.

         (a)      Except  in  the  case  of  Swingline   Loans,   all  fundings,
continuations and conversions of Loans of any Class shall be made by the Lenders
pro rata on the basis of their  respective  Commitments to provide Loans of such
Class (in the case of the  initial  funding of Loans of such Class  pursuant  to
Section 2.2) or on the basis of their respective outstanding Loans of such Class
(in the case of continuations and conversions of Loans of such Class pursuant to
Section 2.11, and  additionally in all cases in the event the  Commitments  have
expired  or have been  terminated),  as the case may be from  time to time.  All
payments on account of principal of or interest on any Loans,  fees or any other
Obligations  owing to or for the  account  of any one or more  Lenders  shall be
apportioned  ratably  among such  Lenders in  proportion  to the amounts of such
principal, interest, fees or other Obligations owed to them respectively.

         (b)      Each  Lender  agrees  that  if it  shall  receive  any  amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment,  realization upon security, exercise of
the  right  of  setoff  or  banker's  lien,  counterclaim  or cross  action,  or
otherwise, other than pursuant to Section 10.7) applicable to the payment of any
of the Obligations  that exceeds its ratable share  (according to the proportion
of (i) the amount of such  Obligations  due and  payable to such  Lender at such
time to (ii) the  aggregate  amount of such  Obligations  due and payable to all
Lenders  at such  time) of  payments  on  account  of such  Obligations  then or
therewith  obtained by all the Lenders to which such  payments  are  required to
have been made, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations  in  such  Obligations  as  shall  be  necessary  to  cause  such
purchasing  Lender to share the excess  payment or other  recovery  ratably with
each of them;  provided,



                                       35
<PAGE>

however,  that  if all or any  portion  of such  excess  payment  is  thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each such other Lender
shall be  rescinded  and each such other  Lender  shall repay to the  purchasing
Lender the  purchase  price to the  extent of such  recovery,  together  with an
amount equal to such other Lender's  ratable share  (according to the proportion
of (i) the amount of such other  Lender's  required  repayment to (ii) the total
amount so recovered from the purchasing  Lender) of any interest or other amount
paid or payable  by the  purchasing  Lender in  respect  of the total  amount so
recovered.  The Borrower  agrees that any Lender so  purchasing a  participation
from another Lender  pursuant to the provisions of this  subsection  may, to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by  law,  exercise  any and all  rights  of  payment
(including,  without  limitation,  setoff,  banker's lien or counterclaim)  with
respect  to such  participation  as fully as if such  participant  were a direct
creditor  of the  Borrower  in the  amount of such  participation.  If under any
applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency or similar law, any Lender receives a secured
claim in lieu of a setoff to which this subsection  applies,  such Lender shall,
to the extent practicable,  exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim
in a manner  consistent  with the  rights of the  Lenders  entitled  under  this
subsection to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         2.16 Increased Costs; Change in Circumstances; Illegality; etc.

         (a)      If, at any time  after the date  hereof and from time to time,
the  introduction  of or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or
in the  interpretation or administration  thereof by any Governmental  Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration  thereof, or compliance by any
Lender  with any  guideline  or  request  from any such  Governmental  Authority
(whether or not having the force of law),  shall (i) subject  such Lender to any
tax or other charge, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender,
in respect of any of its LIBOR Loans or any other amounts  payable  hereunder or
its obligation to make,  fund or maintain any LIBOR Loans (other than any change
in the rate or basis of tax on the  overall  net  income  of such  Lender or its
applicable Lending Office),  (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement (but excluding any reserves to the extent
actually included within the Reserve Requirement in the calculation of the LIBOR
Rate) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
by, such Lender or its applicable Lending Office, or (iii) impose on such Lender
or its applicable  Lending Office any other condition,  and the result of any of
the  foregoing  shall  be to  increase  the cost to such  Lender  of  making  or
maintaining  any LIBOR  Loans or to reduce  the  amount of any sum  received  or
receivable by such Lender  hereunder,  the Borrower  will,  promptly upon demand
therefor by such  Lender,  pay to such Lender such  additional  amounts as shall
compensate such Lender for such increase in costs or reduction in return.

         (b)      If, at any time  after the date  hereof and from time to time,
any Lender shall have  reasonably  determined  that the  introduction  of or any
change in any applicable law, rule or regulation  regarding  capital adequacy or
in the  interpretation or administration  thereof by any Governmental  Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such
Lender  with any  guideline  or  request  from any such  Governmental  Authority
(whether  or not having the force of law),  has or would have the  effect,  as a
consequence of such Lender's Commitment or Loans hereunder, of reducing the rate
of return on the capital of such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender to
a level below that which such Lender or  controlling  Person could have achieved
but for such  introduction,  change or  compliance  (taking  into  account



                                       36
<PAGE>

such  Lender's  or  controlling   Person's  policies  with  respect  to  capital
adequacy),  the  Borrower  will,  promptly  upon demand  therefor by such Lender
therefor,  pay to such Lender such  additional  amounts as will  compensate such
Lender or controlling Person for such reduction in return.

         (c)      If, on or prior to the first day of any Interest  Period,  (y)
the  Administrative  Agent shall have  determined  that adequate and  reasonable
means do not exist for  ascertaining the applicable LIBOR Rate for such Interest
Period or (z) the  Administrative  Agent shall have received written notice from
the Required Lenders of their  determination  that the rate of interest referred
to in the  definition of "LIBOR Rate" upon the basis of which the Adjusted LIBOR
Rate for LIBOR  Loans for such  Interest  Period  is to be  determined  will not
adequately  and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining
LIBOR Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent will forthwith
so  notify  the  Borrower  and the  Lenders.  Upon  such  notice,  (i) all  then
outstanding  LIBOR  Loans shall  automatically,  on the  expiration  date of the
respective  Interest Periods applicable thereto (unless then repaid in full), be
converted  into Base Rate Loans,  (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, to
convert  Base Rate Loans into,  or to  continue,  LIBOR Loans shall be suspended
(including pursuant to the Borrowing to which such Interest Period applies), and
(iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation  given at any
time  thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall be deemed to be a request for
Base Rate Loans,  in each case until the  Administrative  Agent or the  Required
Lenders, as the case may be, shall have determined that the circumstances giving
rise to such  suspension  no longer exist (and the Required  Lenders,  if making
such  determination,  shall have so notified the Administrative  Agent), and the
Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Borrower and the Lenders.

         (d)      Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,  if, at
any time  after the date  hereof and from time to time,  any  Lender  shall have
determined  in  good  faith  that  the  introduction  of or  any  change  in any
applicable law, rule or regulation or in the  interpretation  or  administration
thereof  by any  Governmental  Authority  charged  with  the  interpretation  or
administration  thereof,  or  compliance  with any guideline or request from any
such  Governmental  Authority  (whether or not having the force of law),  has or
would  have the  effect  of  making it  unlawful  for such  Lender to make or to
continue to make or maintain  LIBOR Loans,  such Lender will forthwith so notify
the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower.  Upon such notice, (i) each of such
Lender's then  outstanding  LIBOR Loans shall  automatically,  on the expiration
date of the respective Interest Period applicable thereto (or, to the extent any
such  LIBOR  Loan may not  lawfully  be  maintained  as a LIBOR  Loan until such
expiration date, upon such notice), be converted into a Base Rate Loan, (ii) the
obligation  of such  Lender to make,  to  convert  Base Rate Loans  into,  or to
continue,  LIBOR Loans shall be suspended  (including  pursuant to any Borrowing
for which the  Administrative  Agent has received a Notice of Borrowing  but for
which the Borrowing Date has not arrived),  and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  given at any time thereafter with respect to
LIBOR Loans shall, as to such Lender,  be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate
Loan,  in  each  case  until  such  Lender  shall  have   determined   that  the
circumstances  giving rise to such  suspension no longer exist and shall have so
notified the Administrative  Agent, and the  Administrative  Agent shall have so
notified the Borrower.



                                       37
<PAGE>

         (e)      Determinations by the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender for
purposes of this Section of any  increased  costs,  reduction in return,  market
contingencies,  illegality or any other matter shall,  absent manifest error, be
conclusive, provided that such determinations are made in good faith. No failure
by the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender at any time to demand payment of any
amounts  payable  under this Section  shall  constitute a waiver of its right to
demand payment of any additional amounts arising at any subsequent time. Nothing
in this Section shall require or be construed to require the Borrower to pay any
interest, fees, costs or other amounts in excess of that permitted by applicable
law. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any increased costs or reduction in
return pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) above, it shall provide notice thereof
to the  Borrower  certifying  (i)  that  one of the  events  described  in  such
subsections has occurred and describing in reasonable  detail the nature of such
event, (ii) as to the increased costs or reduction in return resulting from such
event,  and (iii) as to the  additional  amount  demanded  by such  Lender and a
reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof.

         2.17 Taxes.

         (a)      Any and all  payments by the  Borrower  hereunder or under any
Note shall be made,  in accordance  with the terms hereof and thereof,  free and
clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,  levies,
imposts, deductions,  charges or withholdings,  and all liabilities with respect
thereto, other than net income and franchise taxes imposed on the Administrative
Agent or any Lender by the United States or by the  jurisdiction  under the laws
of which  the  Administrative  Agent  or such  Lender,  as the  case may be,  is
organized  or in which its  principal  office  or (in the case of a Lender)  its
applicable  Lending  Office is located,  or any political  subdivision or taxing
authority  thereof (all such nonexcluded  taxes,  levies,  imposts,  deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").
If the Borrower  shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect
of any sum payable  hereunder or under any Note to the  Administrative  Agent or
any Lender,  (i) the sum payable  shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after  making  all  required  deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to
additional sums payable under this Section),  the  Administrative  Agent or such
Lender,  as the case may be,  receives an amount  equal to the sum it would have
received had no such  deductions  been made,  (ii) the  Borrower  will make such
deductions, (iii) the Borrower will pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv)
the Borrower  will deliver to the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender,  as the
case may be, evidence of such payment.

         (b)      The Borrower will indemnify the Administrative  Agent and each
Lender for the full amount of Taxes (including,  without  limitation,  any Taxes
imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the
Administrative  Agent or such  Lender,  as the case  may be,  and any  liability
(including  penalties,  interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto,  whether or not such Taxes were  correctly  or legally  asserted.  This
indemnification  shall be made  within 30 days from the date the  Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, makes written demand therefor.

         (c)      Each of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders agrees that
if it  subsequently  recovers,  or  receives a permanent  net tax  benefit  with
respect to, any amount of Taxes (i) previously paid by it and as to which it has
been indemnified by or on behalf of the Borrower



                                       38
<PAGE>

or (ii) previously deducted by the Borrower (including,  without limitation, any
Taxes deducted from any  additional  sums payable under clause (i) of subsection
(a) above), the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall
reimburse  the  Borrower  to the  extent of the amount of any such  recovery  or
permanent net tax benefit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by or on behalf of the Borrower under this Section with
respect to the Taxes  giving rise to such  recovery or tax  benefit);  provided,
however, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender,  agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case
may be, the  amount  paid over to the  Borrower  (together  with any  penalties,
interest or other charges), in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender
is required  to repay such  amount to the  relevant  taxing  authority  or other
Governmental  Authority.  The determination by the  Administrative  Agent or any
Lender of the amount of any such recovery or permanent net tax benefit shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding.

         (d)      If any Lender is incorporated or organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction  other  than the United  States of America or any state  thereof (a
"Non-U.S.  Lender") and claims  exemption  from United  States  withholding  tax
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, such Non-U.S. Lender will deliver to each
of the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower,  on or prior to the Closing Date
(or, in the case of a Non-U.S.  Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement as
a result of an assignment  after the Closing Date, on the effective date of such
assignment),  (i) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is a "bank" for purposes
of Section  881(c)(3)(A)  of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  a properly  completed
Internal  Revenue  Service Forms W-8ECI or W-8BEN,  as applicable  (or successor
forms), certifying that such Non-U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from or
a reduction  of  withholding  or  deduction  for or on account of United  States
federal income taxes in connection  with payments under this Agreement or any of
the Notes,  together with a properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8
or W-9, as applicable (or successor  forms),  and (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S.
Lender that is not a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal
Revenue Code, a certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative  Agent and the Borrower and to the effect that (x) such  Non-U.S.
Lender is not a "bank" for  purposes  of Section  881(c)(3)(A)  of the  Internal
Revenue Code, is not subject to regulatory or other legal requirements as a bank
in any jurisdiction, and has not been treated as a bank for purposes of any tax,
securities law or other filing or submission made to any governmental authority,
any application made to a rating agency or qualification  for any exemption from
any tax,  securities  law or other legal  requirements,  (y) is not a 10-percent
shareholder for purposes of Section  881(c)(3)(B)  of the Internal  Revenue Code
and  (z) is not a  controlled  foreign  corporation  receiving  interest  from a
related  person for purposes of Section  881(c)(3)(C)  of the  Internal  Revenue
Code,  together with a properly  completed  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
W-9, as applicable  (or successor  forms).  Each such  Non-U.S.  Lender  further
agrees  to  deliver  to each of the  Administrative  Agent and the  Borrower  an
additional  copy of each such relevant form on or before the date that such form
expires or becomes  obsolete or after the  occurrence of any event  (including a
change in its applicable  Lending Office)  requiring a change in the most recent
forms so delivered by it, in each case certifying  that such Non-U.S.  Lender is
entitled to an exemption  from or a reduction of withholding or deduction for or
on account of United States  federal  income taxes in  connection  with payments
under this Agreement or any of the Notes,  unless an event  (including,  without
limitation,  any change in treaty,  law or regulation) has occurred prior to the
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required, which event renders
all such  forms



                                       39
<PAGE>

inapplicable  or the exemption to which such forms relate  unavailable  and such
Non-U.S.  Lender notifies the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower that it is
not entitled to receive  payments  without  deduction or  withholding  of United
States federal income taxes. Each such Non-U.S.  Lender will promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower of any changes in circumstances that would
modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

         (e)      If any  Lender  is  entitled  to a  reduction  in  (and  not a
complete  exemption from) the applicable  withholding  tax, the Borrower and the
Administrative  Agent may withhold  from any interest  payment to such Lender an
amount  equivalent to the applicable  withholding  tax after taking into account
such  reduction.  If any of the  forms or  other  documentation  required  under
subsection  (d) above are not delivered to the  Administrative  Agent as therein
required,  then the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other  documentation
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

         2.18 Compensation. The Borrower will compensate each Lender upon demand
for all losses,  expenses and liabilities  (including,  without limitation,  any
loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment
of  deposits or other  funds  required by such Lender to fund or maintain  LIBOR
Loans) that such Lender may incur or sustain (i) if for any reason (other than a
failure  on the  part of  such  Lender)  a  Borrowing  or  continuation  of,  or
conversion  into, a LIBOR Loan does not occur on a date specified  therefor in a
Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, (ii) if any repayment,
prepayment  or conversion of any LIBOR Loan occurs on a date other than the last
day of an Interest  Period  applicable  thereto  (including as a consequence  of
acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 8.2), (iii) if any
prepayment  of any LIBOR Loan is not made on any date  specified  in a notice of
prepayment  given by the Borrower or (iv) as a consequence  of any other failure
by the  Borrower to make any  payments  with  respect to any LIBOR Loan when due
hereunder.  Calculation  of all amounts  payable to a Lender  under this Section
shall be made as though such Lender had actually  funded its relevant LIBOR Loan
through the purchase of a Eurodollar  deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate
in an  amount  equal  to the  amount  of such  LIBOR  Loan,  having  a  maturity
comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided,  however, that each Lender
may fund its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing  assumption
shall be  utilized  only for the  calculation  of  amounts  payable  under  this
Section.  Determinations  by any Lender for purposes of this Section of any such
losses,  expenses or liabilities  shall,  absent  manifest error, be conclusive,
provided that such determinations are made in good faith.

         2.19 Replacement of Lenders.

         (a)      The  Borrower  may,  at any time and so long as no  Default or
Event of Default has then  occurred  and is  continuing,  replace any Lender (i)
that has  requested  compensation  from the Borrower  under  Section  2.16(a) or
2.16(b),  (ii) the  obligation of which to make or maintain LIBOR Loans has been
suspended under Section 2.16(d) or (iii) that shall refuse to fund, or otherwise
default in the funding,  of its ratable  share of any  Borrowing  requested  and
permitted to be made  hereunder and such refusal has not been  withdrawn or such
default has not been cured within three (3) Business Days after the Borrower has
given such Lender written notice thereof,  in any case under clauses (i) through
(iii) above by written notice to such Lender and the



                                       40
<PAGE>

Administrative  Agent  given not more than thirty (30) days after any such event
and identifying one or more Persons each of which shall be an Eligible  Assignee
and  reasonably  acceptable to the  Administrative  Agent (each,  a "Replacement
Lender," and  collectively,  the  "Replacement  Lenders") to replace such Lender
(the "Replaced  Lender"),  provided that (i) the notice from the Borrower to the
Replaced  Lender and the  Administrative  Agent provided for  hereinabove  shall
specify an  effective  date for such  replacement  (the  "Replacement  Effective
Date"),  which  shall be at least five (5)  Business  Days after such  notice is
given,  (ii) as of the relevant  Replacement  Effective Date,  each  Replacement
Lender shall enter into an Assignment  and Acceptance  with the Replaced  Lender
pursuant to Section 10.7(a) (but shall not be required to pay the processing fee
otherwise payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.7(a), which
fee,  for  purposes  hereunder,   shall  be  waived),  pursuant  to  which  such
Replacement Lenders collectively shall acquire, in such proportion among them as
they may agree with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, all (but not less
than all) of the Commitment and outstanding  Loans of the Replaced Lender,  and,
in connection  therewith,  shall pay (x) to the Replaced Lender, as the purchase
price in  respect  thereof,  an  amount  equal to the sum as of the  Replacement

         2.20 Sale and Assignment of Existing Loans.

         (a)      Each of the  Current  Lenders  party  hereto  that is  selling
Existing  Loans  pursuant to this  Section 2.20 (each,  a "Selling  Lender," and
collectively,  the "Selling Lenders") hereby represents and warrants to (i) each
of the Lenders  party hereto that is not a Current  Lender,  and (ii) each other
Current  Lender party hereto that is purchasing  Existing Loans pursuant to this
Section  2.20 (the Lenders  described  under (i) and (ii),  each, a  "Purchasing
Lender," and collectively,  the "Purchasing Lenders"),  that it is the legal and
beneficial  owner of the  interest in the  Existing  Loans being  assigned by it
hereunder  and that such  interest  is free and clear of any adverse  claim.  In
order to give  effect  to the  assignment  to the  Purchasing  Lenders  of their
respective pro rata shares of the Existing Loans to be concurrently converted to
Term Loans and Revolving Loan  hereunder,  as the case may be, as of the Closing
Date, all as contemplated  hereunder,  each Selling Lender shall and does hereby
sell and assign to each Purchasing Lender,  without recourse,  representation or
warranty (except as set forth in the first sentence of this subsection (a)), and
each  Purchasing  Lender  shall and does  hereby  purchase  and assume from each
Selling  Lender,  a portion of all of the rights and obligations of each Selling
Lender with respect to such Existing Loans  converted to Term Loans or Revolving
Loans  hereunder,  as the case may be, as of the Closing Date and to each of the
Credit  Documents (the "Assigned



                                       41
<PAGE>

Rights") such that after giving effect to such sale and assignment,  the Lenders
shall  own the  Existing  Loans  converted  to Term  Loans and  Revolving  Loans
hereunder in proportion to their  respective Term Loan Commitments and Revolving
Credit  Commitments,  as the case may be. Upon payment by the Purchasing Lenders
to the Selling  Lenders of the amounts  calculated by the  Administrative  Agent
pursuant  to  subsection  (b)  below,  each  Lender  shall  be  entitled  to its
respective  pro rata share of (y) all interest on and any fees in respect of the
Loans and  Commitments  which  accrue on and after the Closing  Date and (z) all
payments of principal made on the Loans  attributable  to such Lender that occur
after the Closing Date.

         (b)      Pursuant to the sale and assignment of the Assigned  Rights to
the Purchasing  Lenders under this Section 2.20, each Selling Lender is entitled
to  receive a  payment  from each  Purchasing  Lender in an amount  equal to the
portion of such Selling Lender's Existing Loans representing the Assigned Rights
ratably  purchased by each  Purchasing  Lender.  In order to facilitate and give
effect to the sale and  assignment of the Assigned  Rights,  each of the Selling
Lenders and Purchasing  Lenders agrees that (i) the  Administrative  Agent shall
calculate  the amount  owing to the Selling  Lenders and to be paid or funded by
the Purchasing  Lenders,  (ii) each of the Purchasing Lenders shall pay or fund,
as the case may be, to the  Administrative  Agent the  amount  specified  by the
Agent in writing to such Purchasing Lender,  and (iii) the Administrative  Agent
shall,  to the extent such  payments or fundings are actually  made,  apply such
amounts ratably to pay the amount owed to the Selling Lenders.

         2.21 Increases of Commitments.

         (a)      Upon (i) the execution of a signature  page to this  Agreement
by an Eligible Assignee (or, in the case of an existing Lender, the execution of
a new signature page evidencing an increase in such Lender's  Commitment(s)) (in
each case and in such capacity,  an "Increasing  Lender") and acceptance thereof
by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, (ii) the execution and delivery by
the  Borrower  of a Note or Notes in favor  of the  Increasing  Lender  for such
Increasing  Lender's  Commitment(s) and Loans (and, in the case of an Increasing
Lender that is an existing  Lender,  the return of its existing Note or Notes ),
and (iii)  delivery of notice to the other Lenders by the  Administrative  Agent
setting  forth the  effective  date of the  addition  of the  Increasing  Lender
hereunder and the amount and Class of such  Increasing  Lender's  Commitment(s),
such Increasing Lender shall, without the necessity of any further action by any
other Lender or Agent,  be for all purposes a Lender party to this  Agreement to
the same extent as if it were an original party hereto with Commitment(s) as set
forth on the signature page executed by the  Increasing  Lender (or, in the case
of  Increasing  Lender  that is an  existing  Lender,  such new  signature  page
executed  by such  Increasing  Lender);  provided,  however,  (x) no Lender  may
increase  its total  Commitments  and Loans  hereunder  to the extent  that such
Lender (without any other Lender) would have sufficient Commitments and Loans to
take action hereunder as, or direct that action be taken hereunder on behalf of,
the Required Lenders and (y) the total  unutilized  Commitments and Loans of all
Lenders shall not exceed in the aggregate $175,000,000.

         (b)      In the event that on the effective  date of the  Commitment(s)
of a Increasing Lender (x) such Lender is assuming a Revolving Credit Commitment
(or, in the case of an Increasing Lender that is an existing Lender, an increase
in such Lender's  Revolving  Credit  Commitment) and (y) any Revolving Loans are
then outstanding,  the Increasing Lender shall



                                       42
<PAGE>

purchase a pro rata participating interest in the Revolving Loans of each of the
other Lenders of such Class. If breakage costs for LIBOR Loans would result from
such  purchases,  to the extent  Revovling  Loans are  outstanding  as Base Rate
Loans, such Increasing Lender shall first purchase its participating interest in
Base Rate Loans, but to the extent a Increasing Lender purchases a participation
in LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section 2.21(b),  any breakage costs incurred as
a result of such  purchases  shall be  reimbursed  by the Borrower in accordance
with Section 2.18.

         (c)      To the extent that an  Increasing  Lender  assumes a Term Loan
Commitment,  the full amount of its new or increased Term Loan Commitment  shall
be immediately made as an additional Loan of that Class.

         (d)      The amount of the  Commitments  and obligations of all Lenders
party hereto prior to the addition of the  Commitment of any  Increasing  Lender
shall not be affected by the addition of such Increasing Lender,  other than the
resulting  adjustment  to the  pro  rata  share  which  each  Lender  has of the
aggregate  Commitments and Loans of the Increasing Lender's Class(es),  it being
intended  that the  Increasing  Lender's  Commitment(s)  and Loans shall be pari
passu with those of the other Lenders of the same Class.

         To induce the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders to enter into this
Agreement  and to induce the Lenders to extend the credit  contemplated  hereby,
the  Borrower  represents  and  warrants  to the  Administrative  Agent  and the
Lenders,  both before and after giving effect to the  Transactions,  as follows:


         4.1  Corporate  Organization  and Power.  Each of the  Borrower and the
Subsidiary Guarantors (i) is a corporation duly organized,  validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its  incorporation,  (ii)
has the full corporate  power and authority to execute,  deliver and perform the
Credit Documents to which it is or will be a party, to own and

<PAGE>

hold its  property and to engage in its  business as  presently  conducted,  and
(iii) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign  corporation  and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction  where the nature of its business or the ownership
of its properties requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be
so qualified would not,  individually or in the aggregate,  be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.2  Authorization;  Enforceability.  Each  of  the  Borrower  and  the
Subsidiary  Guarantors  has taken,  or on the Closing Date will have taken,  all
necessary  corporate  action to execute,  deliver and perform each of the Credit
Documents to which it is or will be a party, and has, or on the Closing Date (or
any later date of  execution  and  delivery)  will have,  validly  executed  and
delivered each of the Credit  Documents to which it is or will be a party.  This
Agreement constitutes, and each of the other Credit Documents upon execution and
delivery will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the
Borrower  and the  Subsidiary  Guarantors  that is a party  hereto  or  thereto,
enforceable  against it in accordance with its terms,  except as  enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium or other
similar  laws  affecting  creditors'  rights  generally,  by  general  equitable
principles or by principles of good faith and fair dealing.

         4.3 No Violation.  The execution,  delivery and  performance by each of
the Borrower and the  Subsidiary  Guarantors  of this  Agreement and each of the
other Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party, and compliance by

provision  of  its  articles  or  certificate  of  incorporation  or  bylaws  or
contravene  any other  Requirement  of Law applicable to it, (ii) conflict with,
result  in a breach  of or  constitute  (with  notice,  lapse of time or both) a

party,  by which it or any of its properties is bound or to which it is subject,
or (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of
its  properties  or  assets.  No  Subsidiary  is a  party  to any  agreement  or
instrument or otherwise subject to any restriction or encumbrance that restricts
or limits its  ability  to make  dividend  payments  or other  distributions  in
respect of its Capital Stock, to repay  Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or any
other  Subsidiary,  to make  loans or  advances  to the  Borrower  or any  other
Subsidiary,  or to transfer any of its assets or  properties  to the Borrower or

is or will be required as a condition to or otherwise in connection with the due
execution, delivery and performance by each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents to which it is or will be
a party or the legality,  validity or  enforceability  hereof or thereof,  other
than  consents  and  filings  the  failure  to obtain or make  which  would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b)      Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors has, and is
in good standing with respect to, all governmental approvals,  licenses, permits
and authorizations  necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted and
to own or lease and  operate  its  properties,  except



                                       47
<PAGE>

for  those  the  failure  to  obtain  which  would  not  be  reasonably  likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.5  Litigation.  There  are  no  actions,  investigations,   suits  or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, at law, in
equity or in  arbitration,  before any court,  other  Governmental  Authority or
other Person, (i) against or affecting the Borrower,  any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their  respective  properties  that would,  if adversely  determined,  be
reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  or (ii) with respect to
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

upon it or upon its properties that are shown thereon as due and payable,  other

returns  accurately  reflect in all material respects all liability for taxes of
the Borrower and the  Subsidiary  Guarantors  for the periods  covered  thereby.
There is no ongoing audit or  examination  or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
other  investigation by any  Governmental  Authority of the tax liability of the
Borrower or any of the Subsidiary  Guarantors,  and there is no unresolved claim
by any  Governmental  Authority  concerning the tax liability of the Borrower or
any of the Subsidiary  Guarantors for any period for which tax returns have been
or were  required  to have been  filed,  other than  claims  for which  adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Borrower nor
any of the Subsidiary Guarantors has waived or extended or has been requested to
waive or extend the statute of limitations relating to the payment of any taxes.

         4.7  Subsidiaries.  Schedule  4.7 sets forth a list,  as of the Closing
Date,  of  all  of the  Subsidiaries  of  the  Borrower  and,  as to  each  such
Subsidiary,  (i) the percentage  ownership (direct and indirect) of the Borrower
in each class of its  capital  stock and each  direct  owner  thereof,  and (ii)
whether such Subsidiary has assets or existing operations. Except for the shares
of capital stock  expressly  indicated on Schedule  4.7,  there are no shares of
capital stock, warrants,  rights,  options or other equity securities,  or other
Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Borrower  outstanding or reserved for any
purpose.  All  outstanding  shares of capital  stock of each  Subsidiary  of the
Borrower are duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Lender  in  writing  by or on behalf of the  Borrower  or any of the  Subsidiary
Guarantors will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of

         4.9  Margin   Regulations.   Neither  the   Borrower  nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries is engaged principally,  or as one of its important activities,  in
the  business  of  extending  credit for the purpose of  purchasing  or carrying
Margin Stock. No proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly,  to
purchase or carry any Margin Stock (other than Borrower  Margin Stock  purchased
in  accordance  with Section  7.6), to extend credit for such purpose or for any
other purpose that would violate or be inconsistent  with  Regulations T, U or X
or any provision of the Exchange Act.

         4.10 No Material  Adverse  Change.  There has been no Material  Adverse
Change since December 31, 1999, and there exists no event, condition or state of
facts that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         4.11 Financial Matters.

         (a)      The Borrower has  heretofore  furnished to the  Administrative
Agent copies of the (i) audited  consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries  as of December  31,  1999,  1998,  and 1997,  and the related
statements of income,  cash flows and stockholders'  equity for the fiscal years
then ended,  together with the opinion of Ernst & Young,  LLP thereon,  and (ii)
the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as
of  September  30, 2000 and the  related  statements  of income,  cash flows and
stockholders'  equity for the  nine-month  period  then  ended.  Such  financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject,  with respect to
the unaudited financial statements, to the absence of notes required by GAAP and
to normal year-end  adjustments)  and present fairly the financial  condition of
the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries on a consolidated  basis as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries for the respective periods then ended. Except as fully reflected in
the most recent  financial  statements  referred to above and the notes thereto,
there are no material liabilities or obligations with respect to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever  (whether absolute,  contingent
or otherwise and whether or not due).

         (b)      The  unaudited  pro forma  balance sheet of the Borrower as of
March  31,  2001,  a  copy  of  which  has  heretofore  been  delivered  to  the
Administrative  Agent,  gives  pro  forma  effect  to  the  consummation  of the
Transactions,  all as if such  events had  occurred on such date (the "Pro Forma
Balance  Sheet").  The Pro Forma  Balance  Sheet has been prepared in accordance
with GAAP  (subject to the absence of footnotes  required by GAAP and subject to
normal year-end  adjustments)  and,  subject to stated  assumptions made in good
faith and  having a  reasonable  basis set forth  therein,  presents  fairly the
financial  condition of the  Borrower on an unaudited  pro forma basis as of the
date  set  forth  therein  after  giving  effect  to  the  consummation  of  the
transactions described above.

         (c)      The Borrower has prepared, and has heretofore furnished to the
Administrative  Agent a copy of, annual projected  balance sheets and statements
of income and cash flows of the Borrower for the four-year period beginning with
the year ending  December 31, 2001 and ending with the year ending  December 31,
2004, giving effect to the Transactions (the  "Projections").  In the opinion of
management of the  Borrower,  the  assumptions  used in the  preparation  of the
Projections  were fair,  complete  and  reasonable  when made and continue to be
fair,  complete and reasonable as of the date hereof.  The Projections have been
prepared in good faith by the



                                       49
<PAGE>

executive and financial personnel of the Borrower,  are complete and represent a
reasonable  estimate of the future  performance  and financial  condition of the
Borrower,  subject  to the  uncertainties  and  approximations  inherent  in any
projections.

         (d)      Each of the  Borrower  and the  Subsidiary  Guarantors,  after
giving effect to the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby, (i)
has capital  sufficient to carry on its  businesses as conducted and as proposed
to be  conducted,  (ii) has assets with a fair saleable  value,  determined on a
going concern basis,  (y) not less than the amount  required to pay the probable
liability  on its  existing  debts as they become  absolute  and matured and (z)
greater  than  the  total  amount  of  its  liabilities   (including  identified
contingent liabilities,  valued at the amount that can reasonably be expected to
become absolute and matured), and (iii) does not intend to, and does not believe
that it will,  incur debts or  liabilities  beyond its ability to pay such debts
and liabilities as they mature.

         4.12   Ownership   of   Properties.   Except  for  minor   defects  and
irregularities which, individually or in the aggregate, do not materially impair
the  practical use thereof for its intended  purposes,  each of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries (i) has good and marketable title to all real property owned by
it, (ii) holds  interests  as lessee under valid leases in full force and effect
with  respect  to all  material  leased  real  and  personal  property  used  in
connection  with its  business,  (iii)  possesses or has rights to use licenses,
patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  service marks,  trade names and other assets
sufficient  to enable it to continue to conduct its  business  substantially  as
heretofore  conducted  and  without  any  material  conflict  with the rights of
others,  and (iv)  has good  title to all of its  other  properties  and  assets
reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 4.11(a)
(except as sold or otherwise  disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary
course of business), in each case under (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

         4.13 ERISA.

         (a)      Each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance
in all material respects with the applicable  provisions of ERISA, and each Plan
is and has been  administered  in compliance  in all material  respects with all
applicable  Requirements of Law, including,  without limitation,  the applicable
provisions  of ERISA  and the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  No ERISA  Event (i) has
occurred  within  the  five-year  period  prior to the  Closing  Date,  (ii) has
occurred  and is  continuing,  or (iii) to the  knowledge  of the  Borrower,  is
reasonably  expected to occur with respect to any Plan. No Plan has any Unfunded
Pension  Liability  as of the  most  recent  annual  valuation  date  applicable
thereto,  and  neither the  Borrower  nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has engaged in a
transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

         (b)      Neither  the  Borrower  nor  any  ERISA  Affiliate  has  had a
complete or partial  withdrawal  from any  Multiemployer  Plan,  and neither the
Borrower nor any ERISA  Affiliate  would become  subject to any liability  under
ERISA if the Borrower or any ERISA  Affiliate were to withdraw  completely  from
all  Multiemployer  Plans as of the most recent valuation date. No Multiemployer
Plan is in  "reorganization"  or is "insolvent" within the meaning of such terms
under ERISA.

         4.14 Environmental Matters.

         (a)      To the knowledge of the Borrower,  no Hazardous Substances are
or have been generated, used, located, released,  treated, disposed of or stored
by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or by any other Person (including any
predecessor  in interest) or otherwise,  in, on or under any portion of any real
property, leased or owned, of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except in
material  compliance with all applicable  Environmental  Laws, and no portion of
any such real  property  or, to the  knowledge of the  Borrower,  any other real
property at any time  leased,  owned or  operated by the  Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries,  has been contaminated by any Hazardous Substance;  and no portion
of  any  real  property,  leased  or  owned,  of  the  Borrower  or  any  of its
Subsidiaries  has been or is presently  the subject of an  environmental  audit,
assessment or remedial action.

         (b)      No  portion  of any real  property,  leased or  owned,  of the
Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries has been used by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries  or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,  by any other Person,  as or
for a mine, a landfill,  a dump or other disposal  facility,  a gasoline service
station,  or (other than for petroleum  substances stored in the ordinary course
of  business) a petroleum  products  storage  facility;  no portion of such real
property or any other real property at any time leased, owned or operated by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has, pursuant to any Environmental Law, been
placed on the  "National  Priorities  List" or  "CERCLIS  List" (or any  similar
federal,  state  or  local  list) of sites  subject  to  possible  environmental
problems;  and there are not and have never been any  underground  storage tanks
situated on any real  property,  leased or owned,  of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries.

         (c)      To  the  knowledge  of  the  Borrower,   all   activities  and
operations  of the  Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  are in  compliance  with all
material requirements of all applicable Environmental Laws, except to the extent
the  failure  so to  comply,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  would  not be
reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect.  Each of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries has obtained all licenses and permits under  Environmental Laws
necessary to its respective operations;  all such licenses and permits are being
maintained in good standing; and each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in
substantial  compliance  with all  terms and  conditions  of such  licenses  and
permits, except for such licenses and permits the failure to obtain, maintain or
comply  with  which  would  not be  reasonably  likely,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  to have a Material  Adverse Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries is involved in any suit, action or proceeding,  or has received
any notice,  complaint or other request for  information  from any  Governmental
Authority or other Person,  with respect to any actual or alleged  Environmental
Claims that, if adversely determined,  would be reasonably likely,  individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to the knowledge of
the  Borrower,   there  are  no  threatened  actions,   suits,   proceedings  or
investigations  with  respect to any such  Environmental  Claims,  nor any basis
therefor.

         4.15 Compliance  With Laws.  Each of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries
has timely filed all material reports, documents and other materials required to
be filed by it under all applicable  Requirements  of Law with any  Governmental
Authority,  has  retained  all  material  records and  documents  required to be
retained by it under all  applicable  Requirements  of Law,  and is otherwise in
compliance with all applicable  Requirements of Law in respect of the conduct of
its business and the ownership and operation of its properties,  except for such



                                       51
<PAGE>

Requirements  of Law the failure to comply with  which,  individually  or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.16  Regulated  Industries.  Neither  the  Borrower  nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  is (i) an  "investment  company,"  a  company  "controlled"  by an
"investment  company,"  or an  "investment  advisor,"  within the meaning of the
Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended,  or (ii) a "holding  company," a
"subsidiary  company" of a "holding  company," or an  "affiliate"  of a "holding

         4.17 Insurance. The assets, properties and business of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries  are insured against such hazards and  liabilities,  under such
coverages  and  in  such  amounts,  as are  customarily  maintained  by  prudent
companies similarly situated and under policies issued by insurers of recognized
responsibility.

         4.18 Material  Contracts.  Schedule 4.18 lists, as of the Closing Date,
each "material  contract"  (within the meaning of Item  601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K under the Exchange Act) to which the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries is
a party,  by which  any of them or their  respective  properties  is bound or to
which any of them is subject  (collectively,  "Material  Contracts").  As of the
Closing  Date,  (i) each  Material  Contract  is in full force and effect and is
enforceable  by the  Borrower  or the  Subsidiary  that  is a party  thereto  in
accordance  with  its  terms,  and  (ii)  neither  the  Borrower  nor any of its
Subsidiaries (nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any other party thereto) is

within the meaning of the  National  Labor  Relations  Act of 1947,  as amended.
There is (i) no unfair  labor  practice  complaint  before  the  National  Labor

any  collective  bargaining  agreement,  pending  or,  to the  knowledge  of the
Borrower, threatened,  against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,  (ii) no
strike, lock-out, slowdown, stoppage, walkout or other labor dispute pending or,
to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, against the Borrower or any of its

certification or union election or union organizing activities taking place with
respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

         information  about the business,  condition  (financial or  otherwise),
         operations  or  properties  of the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries
         (including  any Plan and any  information  required  to be filed  under

replacements  of  such  properties,  except  to the  extent  that  any  of  such
properties are obsolete or are being replaced. Nothing contained in this Section
5.3 shall prevent  either the Borrower or a Subsidiary  from  discontinuing  any
part  of  the  business  of  either  the  Borrower  or  such  Subsidiary  if the

its  Subsidiaries  to, (i) pay all  liabilities  and obligations as and when due

Effect,  and (ii) pay and  discharge  all taxes,  assessments  and  governmental
charges or levies imposed upon it, upon its income or profits or upon any of its
properties,  prior to the date on which penalties would attach thereto,  and all
lawful claims that, if unpaid, might become a Lien upon any of the properties of
the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries;  provided,  however,  that neither the
Borrower  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  shall be  required  to pay any such tax,
liability,  obligation,  assessment,  charge,  levy or claim that is  reasonably
being  contested  in good  faith and by  proper  proceedings  as to  assessment,

Subsidiary is maintaining  adequate  reserves with respect thereto in accordance
with GAAP.

         5.6  Insurance.   The  Borrower  will,  and  will  cause  each  of  its
Subsidiaries  to,  maintain  with  financially  sound  and  reputable  insurance

subject to Section 10.13, permit employees or agents of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to inspect its properties and examine or audit its books, records,
working  papers and  accounts  and make  copies and  memoranda  of them,  and to
discuss its affairs,  finances and accounts with its officers and employees and,
upon notice to the Borrower,  the independent public accountants of the Borrower
and its  Subsidiaries  (and by  this  provision  the  Borrower  authorizes  such
accountants  to  discuss  the  finances  and  affairs  of the  Borrower  and its
Subsidiaries),  all at such times and from time to time, upon reasonable  notice
and during business hours, as may be reasonably requested.

         through  6.3, in each case such  compliance  determined  with regard to

         terms of such Permitted Acquisition (including, without limitation, the
         purchase  price and method and structure of payment) and of each Person
         or business that is the subject of such Permitted  Acquisition (each, a
         "Target");

                  (iii)    consolidated   projected  income  statements  of  the

         Permitted  Acquisition,   in  reasonable  detail,   together  with  any
         appropriate statement of assumptions and pro forma adjustments; and

                  (iv)     a  certificate,  in  form  and  substance  reasonably
         satisfactory  to the  Administrative  Agent,  executed  by a  Financial
         Officer  of the  Borrower  setting  forth the  Acquisition  Amount  and
         further to the effect that, to the best of such individual's knowledge,
         (x) the consummation of such Permitted Acquisition will not result in a
         violation of any  provision of this  Section (the  calculations  of the
         financial covenants determined in accordance with Section 5.8(a)(ii) to
         be  attached to the  certificate),  (y) the  Borrower  believes in good
         faith that it will continue to comply with such financial covenants for
         a period of one year  following  the date of the  consummation  of such
         Permitted  Acquisition,  and (z) after giving effect to such  Permitted

any Permitted Acquisition, the Borrower will deliver to the Administrative Agent
and each Lender a copy of the fully executed  acquisition  agreement  (including
schedules and exhibits thereto) and other material  documents and closing papers
delivered in connection therewith.

         (d)      The consummation of each Permitted Acquisition shall be deemed
to be a  representation  and warranty by the Borrower that (except as shall have
been  approved in writing by the Required  Lenders) all  conditions  thereto set
forth in this  Section  and in the  description  furnished  under  clause (i) of
subsection  (b)  above  have  been  satisfied,  that  the same is  permitted  in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement,  and that the matters  certified to
by the  Financial  Officer of the  Borrower  in the  certificate  referred to in
clause  (iv) of  subsection  (b)  above  are,  to the best of such  individual's
knowledge,  true and  correct  in all  material  respects  as of the  date  such
certificate is given, which  representation and warranty shall be deemed to be a
representation  and warranty as of the date thereof for all purposes  hereunder,
including, without limitation, for purposes of Sections 3.2 and 8.1.

         5.9 Creation or Acquisition of Subsidiaries.  Subject to the provisions

Owned Subsidiaries in connection with Permitted  Acquisitions or otherwise,  and
the Wholly Owned  Subsidiaries  of the Borrower may create or acquire new Wholly
Owned Subsidiaries, provided that concurrently with (and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days thereafter) the creation or direct or indirect acquisition by
the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof,  each such new Subsidiary will execute and
deliver  to the  Administrative  Agent a  joinder  to the  Subsidiary  Guaranty,
pursuant to which such new  Subsidiary  shall  become a party  thereto and shall
guarantee  the payment in full of the  Obligations  of the  Borrower  under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

Subsidiaries  that has assets or active  operations  (other than HRH  Charitable
Foundation) to be, at all times, a Subsidiary  Guarantor.  If the Borrower sells
or otherwise  disposes of all of the Capital Stock of any  Subsidiary  Guarantor
pursuant to any Asset Disposition  permitted by Section 7.4, the  Administrative
Agent shall release such  Subsidiary  Guarantor from its  obligations  under the
Subsidiary Guaranty.

         5.11 Further Assurances.  The Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, make, execute, endorse, acknowledge and deliver any amendments,
modifications  or  supplements  hereto  and  restatements  hereof  and any other
agreements,  instruments or documents,  and take any and all such other actions,
as may from time to time be reasonably  requested by the Administrative Agent or
the  Required  Lenders to  effect,  confirm  or  further  assure or protect  and
preserve the interests,  rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

substantial part of its properties or any other relief under the Bankruptcy Code
or under any other  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  similar  law now or
hereafter in effect,  and such petition or case shall continue  undismissed  and
unstayed  for a period  of sixty  (60)  days;  or an order,  judgment  or decree
approving  or  ordering  any of the  foregoing  shall  be  entered  in any  such
proceeding;

         (i)      Any  one  or  more  money  judgments,  writs  or  warrants  of
attachment,  executions  or similar  processes  involving  an  aggregate  amount
(exclusive  of amounts  fully  bonded or covered  by  insurance  as to which the
surety  or  insurer,  as the case may be,  has  acknowledged  its  liability  in
writing) in excess of $500,000 shall be entered or filed against the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties and the same shall

         (k)      Any ERISA Event or any other event or condition shall occur or

taken, by any  Governmental  Authority in response to any alleged failure by the
Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  to be in  compliance  with  applicable
Requirements of Law, and such action, individually or in the aggregate, would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (m)      Any one or more Environmental  Claims shall have been asserted
against the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  (or a  reasonable  basis shall
exist  therefor);  the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  have incurred or would be
reasonably  likely to incur liability as a result  thereof;



                                       69
<PAGE>

and such liability, individually or in the aggregate, has or would be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (n)      Any of the following  shall occur:  (i) any Person or group of
Persons acting in concert as a partnership or other group shall,  as a result of

owner" (within the meaning of such term under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act)
of securities of the Borrower  representing  25% or more of the combined  voting
power of the then outstanding  securities of the Borrower  ordinarily (and apart
from rights  accruing under special  circumstances)  having the right to vote in
the election of directors;  or (ii) the Board of Directors of the Borrower shall
cease to consist of a majority of the  individuals  who constituted the Board of
Directors  immediately  following the  consummation  of the  Transactions or who
shall have become a member  thereof  subsequent  to the date hereof after having
been  nominated,  or  otherwise  approved in writing,  by at least a majority of
individuals who  constituted the Board of Directors of the Borrower  immediately
following the consummation of the Transactions (or their  replacements  approved
as herein required).

         8.2 Remedies: Termination of Commitments,  Acceleration,  etc. Upon and
at any time after the  occurrence  and during  the  continuance  of any Event of
Default,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  at the  direction,  or may with the
consent,  of the Required  Lenders,  take any or all of the following actions at
the same or different times:

         (a)      Declare the  Commitments  and the  Swingline  Commitment to be
terminated,  whereupon  the  same  shall  terminate  (provided  that,  upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default  pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(h),
the Commitments and the Swingline Commitment shall automatically be terminated);

         (b)      Declare all or any part of the outstanding principal amount of
the Loans to be immediately due and payable,  whereupon the principal  amount so
declared to be immediately due and payable,  together with all interest  accrued
thereon and all other amounts  payable under this  Agreement,  the Notes and the
other  Credit  Documents,  shall  become  immediately  due and  payable  without
presentment,  demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate or other notice or
legal  process of any kind,  all of which are  hereby  knowingly  and  expressly
waived  by the  Borrower  (provided  that,  upon the  occurrence  of an Event of
Default  pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section  8.1(h),  all of the  outstanding
principal amount of the Loans and all other amounts described in this subsection
(b) shall automatically  become immediately due and payable without presentment,
demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate or other notice or legal process
of any kind,  all of which are  hereby  knowingly  and  expressly  waived by the
Borrower); and

         (c)      Exercise  all rights and  remedies  available to it under this
Agreement, the other Credit Documents and applicable law.

         8.3  Remedies:  Set-Off.  In addition to all other  rights and remedies
available under the Credit Documents or applicable law or otherwise, upon and at
any time  after  the  occurrence  and  during  the  continuance  of any Event of
Default,  each Lender may, and each is hereby authorized by the Borrower, at any
such time and from time to time, to the fullest  extent  permitted by applicable
law, without  presentment,  demand,  protest or other notice of any kind, all of
which



                                       70
<PAGE>

are hereby  knowingly  and expressly  waived by the Borrower,  to set off and to
apply any and all deposits (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or
final) and any other  property at any time held  (including  at any  branches or
agencies,  wherever  located),  and any other indebtedness at any time owing, by
such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the  Borrower  against any or
all of the Obligations to such Lender now or hereafter existing,  whether or not
such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured, the Borrower hereby granting to
each Lender a continuing  security  interest in and Lien upon all such  deposits
and other property as security for such Obligations. Each Lender agrees promptly
to notify the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent after any such set-off and
application;  provided,  however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         9.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes
First Union to act as Administrative  Agent hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents  and to take  such  actions  as  Administrative  Agent  on its  behalf
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents,  and to exercise such powers and
to perform  such duties,  as are  specifically  delegated to the  Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such other powers and duties
as are reasonably incidental thereto.

         9.2 Nature of Duties. The Administrative  Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities  other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents.  The  Administrative  Agent shall not have, by reason of
this Agreement or any other Credit Document, a fiduciary relationship in respect
of any  Lender;  and nothing in this  Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document,
express or implied,  is intended to or shall be so  construed  as to impose upon
the  Administrative  Agent any  obligations  or  liabilities  in respect of this
Agreement or any other Credit  Document  except as expressly set forth herein or
therein.  The  Administrative  Agent may  execute  any of its duties  under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact
and shall not be  responsible  for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to consult with legal counsel,  independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it with respect to all matters  pertaining to this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and its duties hereunder and thereunder
and shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or  omitted  to be taken in good
faith by it in  accordance  with the  advice  of such  counsel,  accountants  or
experts.  The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not
be under any duty to take any  discretionary  action permitted to be taken by it
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document unless
it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required  Lenders (or,  where a
higher percentage of the Lenders is expressly required hereunder, such Lenders).

         9.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,  attorneys-in-fact  or Affiliates
shall be (i) liable  for any  action  taken or omitted to be taken by it or such
Person under or in connection with the Credit Documents,  except for its or such
Person's own gross  negligence or willful  misconduct,  (ii)  responsible in



                                       71
<PAGE>

any   manner  to  any  Lender  for  any   recitals,   statements,   information,
representations  or warranties  herein or in any other Credit Document or in any
document,  instrument,   certificate,  report  or  other  writing  delivered  in
connection herewith or therewith, for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity,  enforceability  or  sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document,  or for the financial  condition of the Borrower,  its Subsidiaries or
any other Person, or (iii) required to ascertain or make any inquiry  concerning
the  performance or observance of any of the terms,  provisions or conditions of
this  Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document  or the  existence  or  possible
existence  of any  Default or Event of Default,  or to inspect  the  properties,
books or records of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

         9.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely,  and shall be fully  protected  in  relying,  upon any notice,
statement,  consent or other communication (including,  without limitation,  any
thereof by telephone, telecopy, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it in good
faith to be genuine  and correct  and to have been  signed,  sent or made by the
proper  Person or  Persons.  The  Administrative  Agent may deem and treat  each
Lender as the owner of its interest hereunder for all purposes hereof unless and
until a written notice of the assignment,  negotiation or transfer thereof shall
have been given to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of
this  Agreement.  The  Administrative  Agent shall be  entitled to refrain  from
taking or omitting to take any action in connection  with this  Agreement or any
other Credit  Document (i) if such action or omission  would,  in the reasonable
opinion of the Administrative Agent, violate any applicable law or any provision
of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or (ii) unless and until it shall
have received such advice or  concurrence  of the Required  Lenders (or, where a
higher percentage of the Lenders is expressly required hereunder,  such Lenders)
as it  deems  appropriate  or it  shall  first  have  been  indemnified  to  its
satisfaction  by the Lenders  against any and all liability  and expense  (other
than  liability  and expense  arising from its own gross  negligence  or willful
misconduct)  that may be incurred by it by reason of taking,  continuing to take
or omitting to take any such action.  Without limiting the foregoing,  no Lender
shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative  Agent as a
result of the Administrative  Agent's acting or refraining from acting hereunder
or under any other Credit  Document in accordance  with the  instructions of the
Required  Lenders  (or,  where a higher  percentage  of the Lenders is expressly
required hereunder, such Lenders), and such instructions and any action taken or
failure  to act  pursuant  thereto  shall be  binding  upon  all of the  Lenders
(including all subsequent Lenders).

         9.5 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly  acknowledges  that  neither the  Administrative  Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made
any representation or warranty to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent
or any such Person hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries,  shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the  Administrative  Agent that (i) it has,  independently  and without reliance
upon the  Administrative  Agent or any other Lender and based on such  documents
and  information  as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own  appraisal of and
investigation into the business, prospects,  operations,  properties,  financial
and other condition and  creditworthiness  of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries
and made its own decision to enter into this  Agreement and extend credit to the
Borrower  hereunder,  and (ii) it will,  independently and without reliance upon
the  Administrative  Agent or any other Lender and based on such  documents  and
information as it shall deem



                                       72
<PAGE>

appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit  analysis,  appraisals
and  decisions  in taking or not  taking  action  hereunder  and under the other
Credit Documents and to make such  investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the  business,  prospects,  operations,  properties,  financial and
other  condition  and  creditworthiness  of the Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries.
Except as expressly  provided in this Agreement and the other Credit  Documents,
the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility,  either initially
or on a  continuing  basis,  to  provide  any  Lender  with any  credit or other
information  concerning  the  business,   prospects,   operations,   properties,
financial  or  other  condition  or  creditworthiness   of  the  Borrower,   its
Subsidiaries  or any other Person that may at any time come into the  possession
of the  Administrative  Agent  or any of  its  officers,  directors,  employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

         9.6 Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have  knowledge or notice of the  occurrence  of any Default or Event of Default
unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have  received  written  notice from the
Borrower or a Lender  referring to this  Agreement,  describing  such Default or
Event of Default and stating  that such notice is a "notice of  default." In the
event that the  Administrative  Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative
Agent will give notice thereof to the Lenders as soon as reasonably practicable;
provided,  however,  that if any such  notice  has also  been  furnished  to the
Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to notify the Lenders
with respect thereto.  The  Administrative  Agent shall (subject to Sections 9.4
and 10.6) take such action with  respect to such  Default or Event of Default as
shall reasonably be directed by the Required Lenders;  provided that, unless and
until  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  received  such  directions,  the
Administrative  Agent may (but shall not be obligated  to) take such action,  or
refrain  from  taking  such  action,  with  respect to such  Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem  advisable in the best  interests of the Lenders except
to the extent that this Agreement  expressly requires that such action be taken,
or not be taken, only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Required
Lenders or all of the Lenders.

         9.7  Indemnification.  To the  extent the  Administrative  Agent is not
reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower,  and without limiting the obligation
of the Borrower to do so, the Lenders agree (i) to indemnify the  Administrative
Agent and its officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,  attorneys-in-fact  and
Affiliates,  ratably in proportion to their  respective  percentages  as used in
determining  the  Required  Lenders  as of the date of  determination,  from and
against  any and  all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,
actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  (including,  without limitation,
attorneys' fees and expenses) or disbursements of any kind or nature  whatsoever
that may at any time (including,  without limitation,  at any time following the
repayment  in full of the  Loans  and the  termination  of the  Commitments)  be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative  Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated
hereby or  thereby or any action  taken or omitted by the  Administrative  Agent
under or in  connection  with any of the  foregoing,  and (ii) to reimburse  the
Administrative  Agent upon demand,  ratably in  proportion  to their  respective
percentages  as used in  determining  the  Required  Lenders  as of the  date of
determination,  for  any  expenses  incurred  by  the  Administrative  Agent  in
connection   with   the   preparation,    negotiation,    execution,   delivery,
administration,  amendment, modification, waiver or enforcement (whether through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or  responsibilities  under,



                                       73
<PAGE>

this  Agreement  or  any of  the  other  Credit  Documents  (including,  without
limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses and compensation of agents
and employees  paid for services  rendered on behalf of the Lenders);  provided,
however,  that no Lender  shall be liable for any  portion of such  liabilities,
obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,
expenses or  disbursements  to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified.

         9.8 The Administrative Agent in its Individual  Capacity.  With respect
to its Commitment,  the Loans made by it and the Note or Notes issued to it, the
Administrative  Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent
shall have the same rights and powers  under the Credit  Documents  as any other
Lender and may  exercise  the same as though it were not  performing  the agency
duties specified herein; and the terms "Lenders,"  "Required  Lenders," "holders
of Notes" and any similar  terms  shall,  unless the context  clearly  otherwise
indicates,  include the  Administrative  Agent in its individual  capacity.  The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
make  investments  in,  and  generally  engage  in any kind of  banking,  trust,
financial advisory or other business with the Borrower,  any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective  Affiliates as if the  Administrative  Agent were not
performing  the agency duties  specified  herein,  and may accept fees and other
consideration  from any of them for services in connection  with this  Agreement
and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

         9.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign
at any time by giving ten (10) days' prior  written  notice to the  Borrower and
the Lenders.  Upon any such notice of  resignation,  the Required  Lenders will,
with the prior  written  consent of the  Borrower  (which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably  withheld),  appoint  from  among the  Lenders a  successor  to the
Administrative Agent (provided that the Borrower's consent shall not be required
in the  event  a  Default  or  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing).  If no  successor  to the  Administrative  Agent shall have been so
appointed  by the  Required  Lenders and shall have  accepted  such  appointment
within such  ten-day  period,  then the  retiring  Administrative  Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders and after  consulting  with the Lenders and the  Borrower,
appoint a  successor  Administrative  Agent  from  among the  Lenders.  Upon the
acceptance  of  any   appointment  as   Administrative   Agent  by  a  successor
Administrative  Agent,  such  successor  Administrative  Agent  shall  thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,  privileges and duties
of the retiring  Administrative  Agent,  and the retiring  Administrative  Agent
shall be  discharged  from its duties and  obligations  hereunder  and under the
other Credit Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as
Administrative  Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative
Agent. If no successor to the Administrative  Agent has accepted  appointment as
Administrative   Agent  by  the  thirtieth   (30th)  day  following  a  retiring
Administrative  Agent's  notice  of  resignation,  the  retiring  Administrative
Agent's  resignation  shall  nevertheless  thereupon become  effective,  and the
Lenders shall thereafter perform all of the duties of the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder and under the other Credit  Documents  until such time, if any, as the
Required  Lenders  appoint a  successor  Administrative  Agent as  provided  for
hereinabove.




                                       74
<PAGE>

         9.10  Swingline  Lender.  The  provisions  of this Article  (other than
Section 9.9) shall apply to the Swingline  Lender  mutatis  mutandis to the same
extent as such provisions apply to the Administrative Agent.

         9.11 Syndication Agent, Documentation Agent.  Notwithstanding any other
provision  of  this  Agreement  or  any  of  the  other  Credit  Documents,  the
Syndication Agent and the Documentation  Agent are named as such for recognition
purposes  only,  and in their  capacities as such shall have no powers,  rights,
duties,  responsibilities  or liabilities with respect to this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

                                   ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1 Fees and  Expenses.  The  Borrower  agrees (i)  whether or not the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement  shall be consummated,  to pay upon
demand all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses of the  Administrative
Agent  (including,  without  limitation,  the  reasonable  fees and  expenses of
counsel to the  Administrative  Agent) in connection with (w) the Administrative
Agent's due diligence  investigation  in connection  with, and the  preparation,
negotiation,  execution,  delivery and  syndication  of, this  Agreement and the
other Credit  Documents,  and any  amendment,  modification  or waiver hereof or
thereof or consent with respect  hereto or thereto,  (ii) to pay upon demand all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and each
Lender (including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
in  connection  with  (y)  any  refinancing  or   restructuring  of  the  credit
arrangement  provided  under  this  Agreement,   whether  in  the  nature  of  a
"work-out," in any insolvency or bankruptcy  proceeding or otherwise and whether
or  not  consummated,   and  (z)  the  enforcement,   attempted  enforcement  or
preservation  of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or any of the other
Credit  Documents,  whether in any action,  suit or  proceeding  (including  any
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) or otherwise, and (iii) to pay and hold the
Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against all liability for
any intangibles, documentary, stamp or other similar taxes, fees and excises, if
any,  including any interest and penalties,  and any finder's or brokerage fees,
commissions  and  expenses  (other  than any fees,  commissions  or  expenses of
finders or brokers engaged by the Administrative Agent or any Lender),  that may
be payable in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents.

         10.2  Indemnification.   The  Borrower  agrees,   whether  or  not  the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated,  to indemnify
and hold the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender and each of their respective
directors,  officers,  employees,  agents and Affiliates  (each, an "Indemnified
Person")  harmless  from  and  against  any and  all  claims,  losses,  damages,
obligations,  liabilities,  penalties,  costs and expenses  (including,  without
limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  expenses)  of any kind or  nature
whatsoever,   whether   direct,   indirect   or   consequential   (collectively,
"Indemnified  Costs"),  that  may at any  time be  imposed  on,  incurred  by or
asserted against any such Indemnified  Person as a result of, arising from or in
any way relating to the  preparation,  execution,  performance or enforcement of



                                       75
<PAGE>

this  Agreement or any of the other Credit  Documents,  any of the  transactions
contemplated herein or therein or any transaction  financed or to be financed in
whole  or in part,  directly  or  indirectly,  with the  proceeds  of any  Loans
(including,  without  limitation,  in  connection  with the  actual  or  alleged
generation,  presence, discharge or release of any Hazardous Substances on, into
or from, or the  transportation  of Hazardous  Substances  to or from,  any real
property at any time owned or leased by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
any  other  Environmental  Claims or any  violation  of or  liability  under any
Environmental Law), or any action, suit or proceeding  (including any inquiry or
investigation) by any Person, whether threatened or initiated, related to any of
the foregoing, and in any case whether or not such Indemnified Person is a party
to any such  action,  proceeding  or suit or a subject  of any such  inquiry  or
investigation;  provided,  however,  that no  Indemnified  Person shall have the
right to be  indemnified  hereunder  for any  Indemnified  Costs  to the  extent
resulting from the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of such  Indemnified
Person.  All of the foregoing  Indemnified Costs of any Indemnified Person shall
be paid or reimbursed by the Borrower, as and when incurred and upon demand.

         10.3 Governing  Law;  Consent to  Jurisdiction.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED,  DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED IN, AND SHALL
BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN,  VIRGINIA AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
AND  ENFORCED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE  LAWS OF THE  COMMONWEALTH  OF  VIRGINIA
(WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF). THE BORROWER HEREBY
CONSENTS TO THE  NONEXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION  OF ANY STATE COURT  WITHIN  HENRICO
COUNTY, VIRGINIA OR ANY FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF THE
COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA FOR ANY PROCEEDING INSTITUTED HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OF
THE  OTHER  CREDIT  DOCUMENTS,  OR  ARISING  OUT OF OR IN  CONNECTION  WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT  DOCUMENTS,  OR ANY PROCEEDING TO WHICH THE
ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR THE  BORROWER IS A PARTY,  INCLUDING  ANY
ACTIONS BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,

this waiver in its related future  dealings with the other parties  hereto,  and
(ii) further  warrants and represents  that it has reviewed this waiver with its
legal counsel and that,  based upon such review,  it knowingly  and  voluntarily

         10.6 Amendments,  Waivers, etc. No amendment,  modification,  waiver or
discharge or  termination  of, or consent to any departure by the Borrower from,
any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, shall be effective

Agent at the  direction or with the consent of the Required  Lenders),  and then
the same shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the specific
purpose  for  which  given;   provided,   however,   that  no  such   amendment,
modification, waiver, discharge, termination or consent shall:

         (a)      unless agreed to by each Lender directly affected thereby, (i)
reduce or  forgive  the  principal  amount of any  Loan,  reduce  the rate of or
forgive any interest thereon, or reduce or forgive any fees or other Obligations
(other than fees payable to the Administrative Agent for its own account),  (ii)
extend the Term Loan Maturity  Date, the Revolving  Credit  Maturity Date or any
other  date  (including  any  scheduled  date  for the  mandatory  reduction  or
termination  of any  Commitments)  fixed for the payment of any  principal of or
interest on any Loan (other than (x) payments of principal due and payable under
Section  2.6 on  account  of  Asset  Dispositions,  Equity  Issuances  and  Debt
Issuances  and (y)  additional  interest  payable  under  Section  2.8(b) at the
election of the Required  Lenders,  as provided  therein),  any fees (other than
fees  payable  to the  Administrative  Agent for its own  account)  or any other
Obligations, or (iii) increase or extend any Commitment of such Lender (it being
understood that a waiver of any Event of Default,  if agreed to by the requisite
Lenders hereunder, shall not constitute such an increase);

         (b)      unless  agreed  to by all  of  the  Lenders,  (i)  change  the
percentage of the aggregate  Commitments  or of the aggregate  unpaid  principal
amount of the  Loans,  or the number or  percentage  of  Lenders,  that shall be
required  for the  Lenders  or any of them to take or  approve,  or  direct  the
Administrative  Agent to take, any action  hereunder  (including as set forth in
the definition of "Required  Lenders"),  (ii) release any  Subsidiary  Guarantor
from its  obligations  under the  Subsidiary  Guaranty  except  pursuant  to (x)
Section 5.10 or (y) an Asset Disposition  approved by the Required  Lenders,  or
(iii) change any provision of Section 2.15 or this Section; and

         (c)      unless agreed to by the Swingline Lender or the Administrative
Agent in addition to the Lenders  required as provided  hereinabove to take such
action,  affect the respective  rights or obligations of the Swingline Lender or
the  Administrative  Agent,  as applicable,  hereunder or under any of the other
Credit Documents; and provided further that (i) if any amendment,  modification,
waiver or consent  would  adversely  affect the holders of Loans of a particular
Class (the  "affected  Class")  relative  to holders of Loans of any other Class
(including,  without  limitation,  by way of reducing the relative proportion of
any payments, prepayments or Commitment reductions to be applied for the benefit
of holders of Loans of the  affected  Class under  Sections  2.6(d) and 2.6(e)),
then such amendment,  modification,  waiver or consent shall require the consent
of  Lenders  holding  more  than  fifty-one   percent  (51%)  of  the  aggregate
outstanding  principal  amount of all Loans of the affected Class,  and (ii) the
Fee Letter may be amended or modified,  and any rights  thereunder  waived, in a
writing signed by the parties thereto.

         10.7 Assignments, Participations.

         (a)      Each Lender may assign to one or more other Eligible Assignees
(each, an "Assignee") all or a portion of its rights and obligations  under this
Agreement (including,  without limitation,  all or a portion of its Commitments,
the  outstanding  Loans made by it and the Note or Notes held by it);  provided,
however,  that (i) any such assignment  (other than an assignment to a Lender or
an Affiliate of a Lender) shall not be made without the prior written consent of
the   Administrative   Agent  and  the   Borrower   (to  be   evidenced  by  its
counterexecution of the relevant Assignment and Acceptance), which consent shall
not be unreasonably  withheld (provided that the Borrower's consent shall not be
required in the event a Default or Event of Default  shall have  occurred and be
continuing),  (ii) each such assignment shall be of a uniform,  and not varying,
percentage of all of the assigning  Lender's rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement,  and with respect to each Class of Loans,  each such  assignment by a
Lender of any of its interests  relating to Loans of a particular Class shall be
made in such manner so that the same portion of its Commitment,  Loans,  Note or
Notes and other  interests  under and with  respect to such Class is assigned to
the relevant Assignee,  (iii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or
an Affiliate of a Lender, no such assignment shall be in an aggregate  principal
amount  (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect
to such assignment) less than (x) in the case of Term Loans and Revolving Credit
Commitments,  the aggregate  amount of  $5,000,000,  determined by combining the
amount of the assigning Lender's  outstanding Term Loans and Revolving Loans and
Unutilized  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  (or, if less,  the full amount of the
assigning  Lender's  outstanding  Term  Loans and the  entire  Revolving  Credit
Commitment),  or (y) in the  case  of  Swingline  Loans,  the  entire  Swingline
Commitment and the full amount of the outstanding  Swingline Loans, and (iv) the
parties to each such assignment  will execute and deliver to the  Administrative
Agent,  for its  acceptance  and  recording in the Register,  an Assignment  and
Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, and will
pay a nonrefundable processing fee of $3,000 to the Administrative Agent for its
own account.  Upon such  execution,  delivery,  acceptance  and recording of the
Assignment and Acceptance,  from and after the effective date specified therein,
which  effective  date shall be at least five  Business Days after the execution
thereof  (unless  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  otherwise  agree),  (A) the
Assignee  thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such  Assignment and
Acceptance,  shall have the  rights  and  obligations  of the  assigning  Lender
hereunder with respect thereto and (B) the assigning Lender shall, to the extent
that rights and obligations  hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment  and  Acceptance,  relinquish its rights (other than rights under the
provisions  of this  Agreement  and  the  other  Credit  Documents  relating  to
indemnification  or  payment of fees,  costs and  expenses,  to the extent  such
rights relate to the time prior to the  effective  date of such  Assignment  and
Acceptance) and be released from its  obligations  under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment and Acceptance  covering all or the remaining  portion
of such assigning  Lender's  rights and obligations  under this Agreement,  such
Lender  shall  cease to be a party  hereto).  The terms and  provisions  of each
Assignment and Acceptance shall, upon the effectiveness thereof, be incorporated
into  and  made a part of this  Agreement,  and the  covenants,  agreements  and
obligations of each Lender set forth therein shall be deemed made to and for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other parties hereto as if set forth
at length herein.



                                       79
<PAGE>

         (b)      The  Administrative  Agent will  maintain  at its  address for
notices referred to herein a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to
and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses
of the Lenders and the Commitments  of, and principal  amount of the Loans owing
to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower,  the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register as a Lender  hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement.  The Register  shall be available for  inspection by the Borrower and
each Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon  reasonable  prior
notice.

         (c)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed   by  an   assigning   Lender  and  an  Assignee   and,  if   required,
counterexecuted by the Borrower, together with the Note or Notes subject to such
assignment  and the  processing  fee referred to in  subsection  (a) above,  the
Administrative Agent will (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) on the
effective date thereof, record the information contained therein in the Register
and (iii) give notice  thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders.  Within five (5)
Business  Days  after its  receipt  of such  notice,  the  Borrower,  at its own
expense,  will execute and deliver to the Administrative  Agent, in exchange for
the surrendered  Note or Notes, a new Note or Notes to the order of the Assignee
(and,  if the  assigning  Lender  has  retained  any  portion  of its rights and
obligations  hereunder,  to the  order of the  assigning  Lender),  prepared  in
accordance  with the  applicable  provisions  of  Section  2.4 as  necessary  to
reflect, after giving effect to the assignment,  the Commitments (or outstanding
Term  Loans,  as the  case may be) of the  Assignee  and (to the  extent  of any
retained interests) the assigning Lender, dated the date of the replaced Note or
Notes and otherwise in  substantially  the form of Exhibits A-1, A-2 and A-3, as
applicable. The Administrative Agent will return canceled Notes to the Borrower.

         (d)      Each Lender may,  without  the  consent of the  Borrower,  the
Administrative  Agent or any other  Lender,  sell to one or more  other  Persons
(each, a "Participant")  participations in any portion  comprising less than all
of  its  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (including,   without
limitation,  a portion of its Commitments,  the outstanding Loans made by it and
the Note or  Notes  held by it);  provided,  however,  that  (i)  such  Lender's
obligations  under this Agreement  shall remain  unchanged and such Lender shall
remain solely  responsible  for the  performance  of such  obligations,  (ii) no
Lender shall sell any  participation  (other than to its Affiliates)  that, when
taken  together  with all other  participations,  if any,  sold by such  Lender,
covers all of such Lender's rights and obligations  under this Agreement,  (iii)
the Borrower,  the Administrative  Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and  directly  with such  Lender in  connection  with such  Lender's
rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  and no Lender  shall permit any
Participant  to have any voting  rights or any right to control the vote of such
Lender with respect to any  amendment,  modification,  waiver,  consent or other
action  hereunder or under any other Credit Document  (except as to actions that
would (x) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan, reduce the rate of
or  forgive  any  interest  thereon,  or  reduce  or  forgive  any fees or other
Obligations,  (y) extend  the Term Loan  Maturity  Date,  the  Revolving  Credit
Maturity  Date or any other date fixed for the  payment of any  principal  of or
interest  on any Loan,  any fees or any other  Obligations,  or (z)  increase or
extend any  Commitment of any Lender),  and (iv) no  Participant  shall have any
rights  under  this  Agreement  or any  of  the  other  Credit  Documents,  each
Participant's rights against the granting Lender in respect of any participation
to be those set forth in the participation agreement, and all amounts



                                       80
<PAGE>

payable by the Borrower  hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not
granted such  participation.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  each  Participant
shall have the rights of a Lender for  purposes  of Sections  2.16(a),  2.16(b),
2.17, 2.18 and 8.3, and shall be entitled to the benefits thereto, to the extent
that the Lender granting such  participation  would be entitled to such benefits
if the  participation  had not been made,  provided that no Participant shall be
entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to any of such Sections than the
Lender  granting  such  participation  would  have been  entitled  to receive in
respect  of the  amount  of the  participation  made  by  such  Lender  to  such
Participant had such participation not been made.

         (e)      Nothing in this  Agreement  shall be construed to prohibit any
Lender from  pledging or assigning all or any portion of its rights and interest
hereunder  or  under  any  Note to any  Federal  Reserve  Bank as  security  for
borrowings therefrom; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment shall
release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.

         (f)      Any  Lender  or  participant   may,  in  connection  with  any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to
this Section,  disclose to the Assignee or Participant  or proposed  Assignee or
Participant  any  information  relating  to the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries
furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party  hereto,  provided  that such
Assignee or Participant or proposed Assignee or Participant agrees in writing to
keep such  information  confidential  to the same extent required of the Lenders
under Section 10.3.

         10.8 No Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
are  cumulative  and in addition to, and not  exclusive of, all other rights and
remedies  available at law, in equity or  otherwise.  No failure or delay on the
part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or
privilege  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial
exercise  of any  such  right,  power or  privilege  preclude  other or  further
exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other  right,  power or privilege or be
construed  to be a waiver  of any  Default  or Event of  Default.  No  course of
dealing between any of the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent or the Lenders
or their  agents or employees  shall be effective to amend,  modify or discharge
any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit  Document or to constitute a
waiver of any  Default  or Event of  Default.  No  notice to or demand  upon the
Borrower in any case shall  entitle the Borrower to any other or further  notice
or demand in similar or other  circumstances or constitute a waiver of the right
of the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender to  exercise  any right or remedy or
take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

         10.9  Successors  and Assigns.  This  Agreement  shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable  by the  respective  successors  and
assigns of the parties hereto,  and all references  herein to any party shall be
deemed to include its successors and assigns;  provided,  however,  that (i) the
Borrower shall not sell, assign or transfer any of its rights, interests, duties
or obligations  under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all of
the Lenders and (ii) any Assignees and  Participants  shall have such rights and
obligations with respect to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as are
provided for under and pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.7.



                                       81
<PAGE>

         10.10 Survival. All representations,  warranties and agreements made by
or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in this Agreement and in
the other Credit  Documents  shall survive the execution and delivery  hereof or
thereof,  the making and  repayment of the Loans.  In addition,  notwithstanding
anything herein or under applicable law to the contrary,  the provisions of this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents  relating to indemnification or payment
of fees, costs and expenses,  including,  without limitation,  the provisions of
Sections  2.16(a),  2.16(b),  2.17,  2.18, 9.7, 10.1 and 10.2, shall survive the

termination of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

         10.11  Severability.  To the extent any provision of this  Agreement is

provision  shall  be  ineffective  only to the  extent  of such  prohibition  or
invalidity and only in such  jurisdiction,  without  prohibiting or invalidating
such  provision in any other  jurisdiction  or the remaining  provisions of this
Agreement in any jurisdiction.

         10.12 Construction.  The headings of the various articles, sections and
subsections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience  only and shall
not in any way  affect  the  meaning or  construction  of any of the  provisions
hereof.  Except as otherwise  expressly  provided herein and in the other Credit
Documents,  in the event of any  inconsistency or conflict between any provision
of this  Agreement and any provision of any of the other Credit  Documents,  the
provision of this Agreement shall control.

         10.13  Confidentiality.   Each  Lender  agrees  to  keep  confidential,
pursuant to its customary procedures for handling confidential  information of a
similar  nature and in  accordance  with safe and sound banking  practices,  all
nonpublic  information  provided to it by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document;
provided,  however,  that any Lender may disclose  such  information  (i) to its
directors,  employees  and  agents  and  to  its  auditors,  counsel  and  other
professional  advisors,  (ii) at the demand or  request  of any bank  regulatory
authority,   court  or  other   Governmental   Authority   having  or  asserting
jurisdiction  over such Lender, as may be required pursuant to subpoena or other
legal process,  or otherwise in order to comply with any applicable  Requirement
of Law, (iii) in connection with any proceeding to enforce its rights  hereunder
or under any other Credit Document or any other litigation or proceeding related
hereto or to which it is a party, (iv) to the Administrative  Agent or any other
Lender, (v) to the extent the same has become publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Agreement and (vi) pursuant to and in accordance with
the provisions of Section 10.7(f).

         10.14  Counterparts;  Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts  and  by  different  parties  hereto  on  separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all of which shall  together  constitute one and the same  instrument.  This
Agreement shall become  effective upon the execution of a counterpart  hereof by
each of the  parties  hereto  and  receipt by the  Administrative  Agent and the
Borrower  of  written  or  telephonic   notification   of  such   execution  and
authorization of delivery thereof.

         10.15  Disclosure of  Information.  The Borrower agrees and consents to
the  Administrative   Agent's   disclosure  of  information   relating  to  this
transaction  to Gold  Sheets and

terms and other information customarily found in such publications.

         10.16 Entire  Agreement.  THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE OTHER  DOCUMENTS AND
