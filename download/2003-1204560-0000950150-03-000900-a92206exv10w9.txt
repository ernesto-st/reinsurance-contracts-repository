PAYMENT AMOUNT") on each Payment Date. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the
Maturity Date the outstanding principal balance, all accrued and unpaid interest
and all other amounts due hereunder and under the Note, the Mortgage and other
Loan Documents. The accrued and unpaid interest due on the Maturity Date shall
be calculated for the full final Interest Period, notwithstanding that such
Interest Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date.

         (c) All interest shall be computed on the basis of a three hundred
sixty (360) day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed in an
Interest Period (including the first day but excluding the last day of an
Interest Period). Lender shall determine the Note Rate applicable to the Debt in
accordance with this Agreement and its determination thereof shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error. The books and records of Lender shall be prima
facie evidence of all sums owing to Lender from time to time under this
Agreement, but the failure to record any such information shall not limit or
affect the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents.

         (d) Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be
payable at P.O. Box 515228, Los Angeles, California 90051-6528, Attn: Commercial
Mortgage Loan Servicing #1777, or at such other place as the Lender may
designate from time to time in writing, on the date such payment is due, to
Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may designate by written notice to
Borrower. Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be made in
funds settled through the New York Clearing House Interbank Payments System or
other funds immediately available to Lender by 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may
designate by written notice to Borrower. Whenever any payment hereunder or under
the Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the first Business Day preceding such scheduled due
date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts due under the Loan Documents shall
be deemed paid so long as there is sufficient money in the Cash Management
Account for payment of such amounts and Lender's access to such money has not
been constrained or constricted in any manner.



                                      -21-
<PAGE>
         (e) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, all monthly
payments made as scheduled under this Agreement and the Note shall be applied to
the payment of interest computed at the Note Rate. All voluntary and involuntary
prepayments on the Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to accrued but
unpaid interest on the amount prepaid, to the remaining principal amount, and
any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such
manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion.
Following the occurrence of an Event of Default, any payment made on the Note
shall be applied to accrued but unpaid interest, late charges, accrued fees, the
unpaid principal amount of the Note, and any other sums due and unpaid to Lender
in connection with the Loan, in such manner and order as Lender may elect in its
sole and absolute discretion.

         (f) All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the Note or the
other Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any deduction
for, any setoff, defense or counterclaims.

         SECTION 2.4. LATE PAYMENT CHARGE

         Except for the payment due on the Maturity Date, if any principal or
interest payment is not paid by Borrower on or before the date on which same is
due (unless sufficient funds for payment thereof are on deposit in the Cash
Management Account and Lender's access thereto has not been restricted or
constrained), Borrower shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the
lesser of four percent (4%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted
by applicable law in order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling
and processing such delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of
the use of such delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law.

         SECTION 2.5. PREPAYMENT

         Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 2.5 no
voluntary prepayments, whether in whole or in part, of the Loan or any other
amount at any time due and owing under the Note can be made by Borrower or any
other Person without the express written consent of Lender.

         (a) Lockout Period. Borrower has no right to make, and Lender shall
have no obligation to accept, any voluntary prepayment, whether in whole or in
part, of the Loan during the Lockout Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
either (i) Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, accepts a full or
partial voluntary prepayment during the Lockout Period or (ii) there is an
involuntary prepayment during the Lockout Period, then, in either case, Borrower
shall, in addition to any portion of the Loan prepaid (together with all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in an
amount calculated in accordance with Section 2.5(c) hereof.

         (b) Intentionally omitted.

         (c) Involuntary Prepayment During the Lockout Period. If, during the
Lockout Period, payment of all or any part of the Debt is tendered by Borrower
or otherwise recovered by Lender in the exercise of its remedies under the Loan
Documents, such tender or recovery shall



                                      -22-
<PAGE>
be (i) made on the next occurring Payment Date together with the Monthly Payment
Amount and (ii) deemed a voluntary prepayment by Borrower in violation of the
prohibition against prepayment set forth in this Section 2.5 and Borrower shall
pay, in addition to the Debt, (x) an amount equal to the Lockout Yield
Maintenance Premium and (y) the accrued and unpaid interest calculated for the
full Interest Period in which such voluntary prepayment occurs.

         (d) Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds; Excess Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, and provided no
Event of Default exists, Borrower shall not be required to pay any prepayment
premium in connection with any prepayment occurring solely as a result of (i)
the application of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Documents, or (ii) the application of any interest in excess
of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law to the reduction of the Loan.

         (e) After the Lockout Period. Commencing on the day after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, and upon giving Lender at least sixty (60)
days (but not more than ninety (90) days) prior written notice, Borrower may
voluntarily prepay (without premium) the Note in whole (but not in part) on a
Payment Date. Lender shall accept a prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.5(e)
on a day other than a Payment Date provided that, in addition to payment of the
full outstanding principal balance of the Note, Borrower pays to Lender a sum
equal to the amount of interest which would have accrued on the Note if such
prepayment occurred on the next Payment Date.

         (f) Limitation on Partial Prepayments. In no event shall Lender have
any obligation to accept a partial prepayment.

         SECTION 2.6. PAYMENTS AFTER DEFAULT

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan,
(a) shall accrue at the Default Rate, and (b) Lender shall be entitled to
receive and Borrower shall pay to Lender all cash flow from the Property in
accordance with the terms of Article 10 hereof, such amount to be applied by
Lender to the payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall determine in its
sole discretion, including, without limitation, alternating applications thereof
between interest and principal. Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed
from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the earlier of (i) the actual
receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then due)
and (ii) the cure of such Event of Default. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, interest at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall
itself accrue interest at the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the
Mortgage. This paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to
extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right
or remedy accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of
Default; the acceptance of any payment from Borrower shall not be deemed to cure
or constitute a waiver of any Event of Default; and Lender retains its rights
under this Agreement to accelerate and to continue to demand payment of the Debt
upon the happening of and during the continuance any Event of Default, despite
any payment by Borrower to Lender.

         SECTION 2.7. INTENTIONALLY DELETED



                                      -23-
<PAGE>
         SECTION 2.8. USURY SAVINGS

         This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that
at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance
due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Note Rate or
the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum
Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and
not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid
to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and
applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

         SECTION 2.9. UNAVAILABILITY OF RATE. In the event that Lender shall
have determined in its reasonable discretion that none of the methods set forth
in the definition of "LIBOR" herein are available, then Lender shall forthwith
give notice by telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing, to
Borrower at least one (1) day prior to the last day of the related Interest
Period. If such notice is given, the Note Rate, commencing with such related
Interest Period shall be the LIBOR Rate in effect for the most recent Interest
Period (the "STATIC LIBOR RATE").

         (a) If, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Loan has been
converted to the Static LIBOR Rate and Lender shall determine (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest
error) that the event(s) or circumstance(s) which resulted in such conversion
shall no longer be applicable, Lender shall give notice thereof to Borrower, and
the Loan will be converted from the Static LIBOR Rate to the LIBOR Rate
effective on the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Borrower have the right to elect to convert from the LIBOR Rate to the
Static LIBOR Rate.

         (b) (i) All payments made by Borrower hereunder shall be made free and
clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, income, stamp or other
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, reserves or
withholdings imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authorities, which are imposed, enacted or become effective on or
after the Closing Date (such non-excluded taxes being referred to collectively
as "FOREIGN TAXES"), excluding income and franchise taxes of the United States
of America or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.
If any Foreign Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to
Lender hereunder and such Foreign Taxes are not a result of activities of Lender
unrelated to the Loan or Borrower, the amounts so payable to Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to Lender (after payment of all
Foreign Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rate
or in the amounts specified hereunder. Whenever any Foreign Taxes are payable
pursuant to applicable law by Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter,
Borrower shall send to Lender an original official receipt, if



                                      -24-
<PAGE>

available, or certified copy thereof showing payment of such Foreign Taxes.
Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by Lender which may result from any failure by
Borrower to pay any such Foreign Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority of which Lender shall have provided Borrower with prior written
notice, if possible, or any failure by Borrower to remit to Lender the required
receipts or other required documentary evidence. Lender's inability to notify
Borrower of any such Foreign Taxes in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence shall in no way relieve Borrower of its obligations under this Section
2.9(b). (ii) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any
Foreign Taxes, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to
the Borrower, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, at Borrower's request, Lender
shall provide to Borrower its understanding as to whether any Foreign Taxes will
be applicable to any forthcoming payments due under the Loan Documents. Lender
shall not be entitled to claim compensation pursuant to this Section 2.9(b) for
any Foreign Taxes to the extent that such Foreign Taxes result from a failure to
comply with the requirements of this paragraph. (iii) If Lender determines in
good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Foreign Taxes for
which indemnification has been demanded hereunder, Lender shall cooperate with
Borrower in challenging such Taxes at Borrower's expense if so requested by
Borrower. If Lender receives a refund of Foreign Tax for which a payment has
been made by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, which refund in the good faith
judgment of Lender is attributable to such payment made by Borrower, then Lender
shall reimburse Borrower for such amount (together with any interest received
thereon) as Lender determines to be the proportion of the refund as will leave
it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position than it would have
been in if the payment had not been required. (iv) If the Borrower is required
to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.9(b) as a result of a change in law or treaty occurring after such
Lender first became a party to this Agreement, then such Lender will, at the
request of the Borrower, change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending
office if such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment
which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is, in such Lender's sole, reasonable
discretion, determined not to be materially disadvantageous or cause
unreasonable hardship to such Lender, provided that fees, charges, costs or
expenses that are related to such change shall be borne by the Borrower on
behalf of a Lender, and the mere existence of such expenses, fees or costs shall
not be deemed to be materially disadvantageous or cause undue hardship to the
Lender. Lender agrees that it will (A) take all reasonable actions reasonably
requested by the Borrower in writing that are without material risk and cost to
Lender and consistent with the internal policies of such Lender and applicable
legal and regulatory restrictions (as the case may be) to maintain all
exemptions, if any, available to it from withholding taxes (whether available by
treaty or existing administrative waiver) and (B) to the extent reasonable and
without material risk and cost to it, otherwise cooperate with the Borrower to
minimize any amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.9(b);
provided, however, that in each case, any cost relating to such action or
cooperation requested by the Borrower shall be borne by the Borrower.

         (c) If any requirement of law or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall hereafter make it unlawful for
Lender to make or maintain a Loan with the Note Rate being based on LIBOR as
contemplated hereunder, (i) the obligation of Lender



                                      -25-
<PAGE>

hereunder to make or continue the Loan based on LIBOR or to convert the Loan
from the Static LIBOR Rate to the LIBOR Rate shall be canceled forthwith and
(ii) any outstanding LIBOR Loan shall be converted automatically to a loan
bearing interest at the Static LIBOR Rate (the "STATIC LIBOR RATE LOAN") on the
next succeeding Payment Date or within such earlier period as required by law.
Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay Lender, upon demand, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate Lender for any costs incurred by Lender in
making any conversion in accordance with this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained
by it in order to make or maintain the LIBOR Loan hereunder. If Lender becomes
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9(c), Lender
shall provide Borrower with not less than ninety (90) days written notice
specifying in reasonable detail the event by reason of which it has become so
entitled and the additional amount required to fully compensate Lender for such
additional costs. Lender's notice of such costs, as certified to Borrower, shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) In the event that any change in any requirement of law or in the
interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by Lender with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) hereafter issued from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority:

                  (i) shall hereafter impose, modify or hold applicable any
         reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement
         against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the
         account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any
         other acquisition of funds by, any office of Lender which is not
         otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder;

                  (ii) shall hereafter have the effect of reducing the rate of
         return on Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations
         hereunder to a level below that which Lender could have achieved but
         for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
         Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by any amount
         deemed by Lender to be material; or

                  (iii) shall hereafter impose on Lender any other condition and
         the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender of
         making, renewing or maintaining loans or extensions of credit or to
         reduce any amount receivable hereunder other than with respect to
         taxes;

         then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay Lender, upon
         demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate Lender for such
         additional cost or reduced amount receivable which Lender deems to be
         material as determined by Lender. If Lender becomes entitled to claim
         any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9(d), Lender shall
         provide Borrower with not less than ninety (90) days written notice
         specifying in reasonable detail the event by reason of which it has
         become so entitled and the additional amount required to fully
         compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount. A
         certificate (together with such supporting documentation as Lender
         shall provide) as to any additional costs or amounts payable pursuant
         to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be
         conclusive in the absence of error. This provision shall survive
         payment of the Note and the satisfaction of all other obligations of
         Borrower under this Agreement and the Loan Documents.



                                      -26-
<PAGE>

         (e) Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender and to hold Lender harmless
from any loss or expense which Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of (i)
any default by Borrower in payment of the principal of or interest on a LIBOR
Loan, including, without limitation, any such loss or expense arising from
interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order
to maintain a LIBOR Loan hereunder, (ii) any prepayment (whether voluntary or
mandatory) of the LIBOR Loan that did not include all interest which had accrued
(or would have accrued) at the Note Rate through the end of the related Interest
Period, including, without limitation, such loss or expense arising from
interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of finds obtained by it in order
to maintain the LIBOR Loan hereunder, and (iii) the conversion (for any reason
whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary) of the Note Rate from the LIBOR
Rate to the Static LIBOR Rate with respect to any portion of the outstanding
principal amount of the Loan then bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate on a date
other than the Payment Date immediately following the last day of an Interest
Period, including, without limitation, such loss or expenses arising from
interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of finds obtained by it in order
to maintain a LIBOR Loan hereunder (the amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) are herein referred to collectively as the "BREAKAGE COSTS");
provided, however, Borrower shall not indemnify Lender from any loss or expense
arising from Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct. This provision
shall survive payment of the Note in full and the satisfaction of all other
obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         Lender shall not be entitled to claim compensation pursuant to this
Section 2.9(e) for any Foreign Taxes, increased cost or reduction in amounts
received or receivable hereunder, or any reduced rate of return, which was
incurred or which accrued more than ninety (90) days before the date Lender
notified Borrower of the change in law or other circumstance on which such claim
of compensation is based and delivered to Borrower a written statement setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed
to Lender under this Section 2.9(e), which statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.10. EXTENSION OF THE MATURITY DATE. (I) Borrower shall have
the option to extend the term of the Loan (the "EXTENSION OPTION") beyond the
initial Maturity Date for one (1) term (the "EXTENSION TERM") of one (1) year to
the Payment Date occurring in July, 2008, upon satisfaction of the following
terms and conditions:

         (a) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time Borrower delivers notice to Lender of its intention to exercise the
Extension Option and on the date that the extension term is commenced;

         (b) Borrower shall notify Lender in writing of its election to extend
the Maturity Date as aforesaid not earlier than three (3) months, and no later
than one (1) month, prior to the then applicable Maturity Date, which election
shall be irrevocable commencing on the fifteenth (15th) day prior to the date on
which the Extension Term will commence.

         (c) Borrower shall obtain and deliver to Lender as security for the
Loan prior to the commencement of the Extension Term, one or more Interest Rate
Protection Agreements, which Interest Rate Protection Agreements shall be
effective commencing on the first day of such



                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Extension Term and shall have a maturity date not earlier than the Maturity
Date, as extended pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.10;

         (d) in connection with the Extension Option, Borrower shall have
delivered to Lender together with its notice pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section 2.10 and as of the commencement of the Extension Term, a certificate
from an officer of Borrower in form acceptable to the Lender certifying that
each of the representations and warranties of Borrower contained in the Loan
Documents is true, complete and correct in all material respects as of the date
of such certificate to the extent such representations and warranties are not
matters which by their nature can no longer be true and correct as a result of
the passage of time; and

         (e) in connection with the exercise of the Extension Option, Borrower
shall have paid to Lender the Extension Fee.

         All references in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents to the
Maturity Date shall mean the Maturity Date, as the same may be extended pursuant
and subject to this Section 2.10.

         (II) In the event that Borrower for any reason does not extend the
Maturity Date of the Loan pursuant to this Section 2.10, Borrower shall cause
Mezzanine Borrower to prepay the Mezzanine Loan on the initial Maturity Date in
accordance with the terms of the Mezzanine Loan Documents.

         SECTION 2.11. ADDITIONAL PAYMENT PROVISIONS

                  (i) Within fifteen (15) days after request by Lender (or at
         the time of any prepayment), Borrower shall pay to Lender such amount
         or amounts as will compensate Lender for any loss, cost, expense,
         penalty, claim or liability, including any loss incurred in obtaining,
         prepaying, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds from third
         parties and any loss of yield, as determined by Lender in its judgment
         reasonably exercised incurred by it with respect to the Loan as a
         result of the payment or prepayment of any amount on a date other than
         the date such amount is required or permitted to be paid or prepaid;
         provided that Lender delivers to Borrower a certificate as to the
         amounts of such costs described herein, which certificate shall be
         conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Lender shall have no
         obligation to purchase, sell and/or match funds in connection with the
         finding or maintaining of the Loan or any portion thereof. The
         obligations of Borrower under this Section shall survive any
         termination of the Loan Documents and payment of the Note and shall not
         be waived by any delay by Lender in seeking such compensation.

                  (ii) All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the
         other Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any
         deduction for, any setoff, defense or counterclaims.

                  (iii) Remittances in payment of any part of the loan in less
         than the required amount in immediately available U.S. funds shall not,
         regardless of any receipt or credit issued therefor, constitute payment
         until the required amount is actually received by the holder hereof in
         immediately available U.S. funds and shall be made and accepted subject




                                      -28-
<PAGE>
         to the condition that any check or draft may be handled for collection
         in accordance with the practices of the collecting bank or banks.

                  (iv) If at any time after the date hereof, Lender (which shall
         include, for purposes of this Section, any corporation controlling
         Lender) reasonably determines that due to the adoption or modification
         of any Legal Requirement regarding taxation, Lender's required levels
         of reserves, deposits, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance
         or capital (including any allocation of capital requirements or
         conditions), or similar requirements, or any interpretation or
         administration thereof by any Tribunal or compliance of Lender with any
         of such requirements, has or would have the effect of (a) increasing
         Lender's costs relating to the Loan, or (b) reducing the yield or rate
         of return of Lender on the Loan, to a level below that which Lender
         could have achieved but for the adoption or modification of any such
         Legal Requirements, Borrower shall, within fifteen (15) days of any
         request by Lender, pay to Lender such additional amounts as (in
         Lender's sole judgment, after good faith and reasonable computation)
         will compensate Lender for such increase in costs or reduction in yield
         or rate of return of Lender (a "Consequential Loss"). No failure by
         Lender to immediately demand payment of any additional amounts payable
         hereunder shall constitute a waiver of Lender's right to demand payment
         of such amounts at any subsequent time. Nothing herein contained shall
         be construed or so operate as to require Borrower to pay any interest,
         fees, costs or charges greater than is permitted by applicable Law. If
         a change in the applicable lending office of Lender would eliminate any
         Consequential Loss, Lender shall use its best efforts to change such
         office, so long as such change would not be materially disadvantageous
         or cause unreasonable hardship to Lender.

                  (v) Any demand for payment pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall
         be accompanied by an acknowledgement from Lender that it is applying
         these provisions generally with respect to similar loan transactions

danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, canceled or lost or there shall be

         Lender's consent to such Annual Budget shall be deemed given. Until
         such time that Lender approves a proposed Annual Budget, which approval
         shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the most
         recent Annual Budget shall apply; provided that, such approved Annual
         Budget shall be adjusted to reflect actual increases in Taxes,
         Insurance Premiums, utilities expenses and expenses under the
         Management Agreement.

         Securitization may, or if the principal amount of the Loan when

          (D)  Within ten Business Days after notice from Lender in connection
     with the Securitization of this Loan, such additional financial statements,
     such that, as of the date (each an "OFFERING DOCUMENT DATE") of each
     Disclosure Document, Borrower shall have provided Lender with all financial
     statements as described in subsection (f)(i) above; provided that the
     fiscal year and interim periods for which such financial statements shall

other applicable legal requirements, and shall be further accompanied by a
manually executed written consent of the Acceptable Accountants, in form and
substance acceptable to Lender, to the inclusion of such financial statements in
any Disclosure Document and any Exchange Act Filing and to the use of the name

     this Section 5.11 shall be certified by the chief financial officer or

     Disclosure Document or any filing under or pursuant to the Exchange Act in
     connection with or relating to a Securitization (hereinafter an "EXCHANGE
     ACT FILING") or as shall otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender.

          (v)  In the event Lender determines, in connection with a
     Securitization, that the financial statements required in order to comply
     with Regulation S-X or other legal requirements are other than as provided
     herein, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.11(c) hereof,
     Lender may request, and Borrower shall promptly provide, such combination
     of Acquired Property Statement and/or Standard Statements or such other
     financial statements as Lender determines to be necessary or appropriate
     for such compliance.

          (vi)  Any reports, statements or other information required to be
     delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered in paper form and in the
     event that Lender requires financial statements in connection with
     subsection (c) above because the Loan when combined with the principal
     amount of any Affiliated Loans equal or exceed 20% of the aggregate
     principal amount of all mortgage loans included in a Securitization
     (defined below), Borrower shall deliver such reports, statements and other
     information (A) on a diskette, and (B) if requested by Lender and within

convenient facilities for the examination and audit of any such books and
records.

such document, which shall include the balance of the Loan, the then applicable

has not delivered any notices of default to Borrower.

     (c)  Borrower shall use its best efforts to deliver to Lender, promptly
upon request, duly executed estoppel certificates from any one or more Tenants
as required by Lender attesting to such facts regarding the related Lease as
Lender may require, including, but not limited to attestations that each Lease
covered thereby is in full force and effect with no defaults thereunder on the
part of any party, that none of the Rents have been paid more than one month in
advance, except as security, and that the Tenant claims no defense or offset
against the full and timely performance of its obligations under the Lease.
Other than in connection with a Securitization, Borrower shall not be required
to use its best efforts to deliver such estoppel certificates more than once per
year so long as no Event of Default exists.

     SECTION 5.13. LEASING MATTERS

     (a)  Borrower may enter into a proposed Lease (including the renewal or
extension of an existing Lease (a "RENEWAL LEASE")) without the prior written
consent of Lender, provided such proposed Lease or Renewal Lease (i) provides
for rental rates and terms comparable to existing local market rates and terms
(taking into account the type and quality of the tenant) as of the date such
Lease is executed by Borrower (unless, in the case of a Renewal Lease, the rent
payable during such renewal, or a formula or other method to compute such rent,
is provided for in the original Lease), (ii) is an arm's-length transaction with
a bona fide, independent third party tenant, (iii) does not have a materially
adverse effect on the value of the Property taken as a whole, (iv) is subject
and subordinate to the Mortgage and the Tenant thereunder agrees to attorn to
Lender, either by the terms of such Renewal Lease or pursuant to a
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement on Lender's then current
form (v) does not contain any option, offer, right of first refusal, or other
similar right to acquire all or any portion of the Property, (vi) has a base
term of less than fifteen (15) years including options to renew, (vii) has no
rent credits, free rents or concessions granted thereunder, other than as
consistent with then market standards for prudent institutional owners of Class
A office buildings in the sub-market where the Property is located, and (viii)
is written on the standard form of lease approved by Lender and attached hereto
as Exhibit C, subject to tenant specific negotiated changes which do not,
individually or in the aggregate, cause a Material Adverse Change with respect
to the Property or the financial condition of Borrower. All proposed Leases
which do not satisfy the


                                      -52-

<PAGE>


requirements set forth in this subsection shall be at Borrower's expense and
subject to the prior approval of Lender and its counsel, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender
copies of all Leases which are entered into pursuant to this subsection
together with Borrower's certification that it has satisfied all of the
conditions of this Section.

     (b)  Borrower (i) shall observe and perform all the obligations imposed
upon the landlord under the Leases (or refrain from such observance or
performance to the extent the same is in accordance with prudent institutional
ownership practices for properties similar to and in the same sub-market as
Property) and shall not do or permit to be done anything to impair the value of
any of the Leases as security for the Debt; (ii) shall promptly send copies to
Lender of all notices of default which Borrower shall send or receive
thereunder; (iii) shall enforce all of the material terms, covenants and
conditions contained in the Leases upon the part of the tenant thereunder to be
observed or performed unless Borrower, in accordance with prudent institutional
ownership practices for properties similar and in the same sub-market as the
Property, elects not to enforce any such term, covenant or condition;
(iv) shall not collect any of the Rents more than one (1) month in advance
(except security deposits shall not be deemed Rents collected in advance);
(v) shall not execute any other assignment of the landlord's interest in any of
the Leases or the Rents; with (vi) shall not consent to any assignment of or
subletting under any Leases not in accordance with their terms, without the
prior written consent of Lender, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

     (c)  Borrower may, without the prior written consent of Lender, amend,
modify or waive the provisions of any Lease or terminate, reduce Rents under,
accept a surrender of space under, or shorten the term of, any Lease (including
any guaranty, letter of credit or other credit support with respect thereto)
provided that such actin (taking into account, in the case of a termination,
reduction in rent, surrender of space or shortening of term, the planned
alternative use of the affected space) does not have a materially adverse
effect on the value of the Property taken as a whole, and provided that such
Lease, as amended, modified or waived, is otherwise in compliance with the
requirements of this Agreement and any subordination agreement binding upon
Lender  with respect to such Lease. A termination of a Lease with a tenant who
is in default beyond applicable notice and grade periods shall not be
considered an action which has a materially adverse effect on the value of the
Property taken as a whole. Any amendment, modification, waiver, termination,
rent reduction, space surrender or term shortening which does not satisfy the
requirements set forth in this subsection shall be subject to the prior
approval of Lender and its counsel, at Borrower's expense. Borrower shall
promptly deliver to Lender copies of amendments, modifications and waivers
which are entered into pursuant to this subsection together with Borrower's
certification that it has satisfied all of the conditions of this subsection.

     (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Borrower
shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, enter into, renew,
extend, amend, modify, waive any material provisions of, terminate, reduce
Rents under, accept a surrender of space under, or shorten the term of any
Major Lease.

     (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the
extent Lender's prior approval is required for any leasing matters set forth in
this Section 5.13, Lender shall have


                                      -53-

information and documentation relating thereto in which to approve or
disapprove such matter, provided that such request to Lender is marked in
capitalized bold lettering with the following language: "LENDER'S RESPONSE IS
REQUIRED WITHIN TEN (10) BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE PURSUANT TO
THE TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNDERSIGNED AND LENDER" and the
envelope containing the request must be marked "PRIORITY - LENDER'S RESPONSE
REQUIRED IN TEN (10) BUSINESS DAYS". In the event that Lender fails to respond
to the leasing matter in question within such time, Lender's approval shall be
deemed given for all purposes. Borrower shall provide Lender with such
information and documentation as may be reasonably required by Lender,
including, without limitation, lease comparables and other market information
as required by Lender.

     SECTION 5.14.  PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

Lender, terminate the Management Agreement upon sixty (60) days prior notice to
Manager and replace Manager with a Qualified Manager reasonably approved by
Lender on terms and conditions satisfactory to Lender, it being understood and
agreed that the management fee for such replacement manager shall not exceed
then prevailing market rates.

     (c)  In addition to the foregoing, in the event that Lender, in Lender's
reasonable discretion, at any time prior to the termination of the Assignment
of Management Agreement, determines that the Property is not being managed in
accordance with generally accepted management practices for projects similarly
situated, Lender may deliver written notice thereof to Borrower and Manager,
which notice shall specify with particularity the grounds for Lender's
determination. If Lender reasonably determines that the conditions specified in
Lender's notice are not remedied to Lender's reasonable satisfaction by
Borrower or Manager within sixty (60) days from the date of such notice or that
Borrower or Manager have failed to diligently undertake correcting such
conditions within such sixty (60) day period, Lender may direct Borrower to
terminate the Management Agreement, provided Borrower has the right to do so
pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, and to replace Manager with
a Qualified Manager approved by Lender on terms and conditions satisfactory to
Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee for such
replacement manager shall not exceed then prevailing market rates.

Agreement; (iii) increase or consent to the increase of the amount of any

supplement, alter or amend, or waive or release any of its rights and remedies
under, the Management Agreement in any material respect. In the event that
Borrower replaces Manager at any time during the term of Loan pursuant to this
subsection, such Manager shall be a Qualified Manager.

     (e)  No resignation of Manager shall be effective unless (i) Manager
provides ninety (90) days prior written notice of its intent to resign and (ii)
a Qualified Manager has assumed responsibility for the management of the
Property pursuant to a written management agreement in form and substance
acceptable to Lender.

     SECTION 5.15.  LIENS

     Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any portion of the Property or
permit any such action to be taken, except Permitted Encumbrances and liens

     SECTION 5.16.  DEBT CANCELLATION

ordinance or any other applicable land use law, rule or regulation, without the
prior written consent of Lender.

     SECTION 5.18.  ERISA

     (a)  Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which would cause any
obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by
Lender of any of its rights under the Note, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents) to be a non-exempt (under a statutory or administrative class
exemption) prohibited transaction under ERISA.

     (b)  Borrower further covenants and agrees to deliver to Lender such
certifications or other evidence from time to time throughout the term of the
Loan, as requested by Lender in its sole discretion, that (i) Borrower is not
and does not maintain an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, which is subject to Title I of ERISA, or a "governmental plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA; (ii) Borrower is not subject to state

levied or charged to the Property.

     SECTION 5.20.   RECIPROCAL EASEMENT AGREEMENTS

     Borrower shall not enter into, terminate or modify any REA without
Lender's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Borrower shall enforce, comply with, and
cause each of the parties to the REA to comply with all of the material
economic terms and conditions contained in the REA.

     SECTION 5.21.  ALTERATIONS

     Lender's prior approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required
in connection with any alterations to any Improvements, exclusive of alterations
to tenant spaces required under any Lease, (a) that may have a material adverse
effect on the Property, (b) that affect the structure of the applicable building

alterations to the Improvements shall at any time exceed the Alteration
Threshold, Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender as security for the payment
of such amounts and as additional security for Borrower's obligations under the
Loan Documents any of the following: (i) cash, (ii) direct non-callable

alterations to the Improvements over the Alteration Threshold.

writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

     (k)  Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale pursuant to which
the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject to the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.5; and

     (l)  Transferee shall, prior to such transfer, deliver a substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of the Property in its entirety
to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, a Transferee pursuant to this
Section 7.5 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of Lender to
consent to any subsequent transfer of the Property.

times insurance for Borrower and the Property providing at least the following
coverages:

          (i)  comprehensive "all risk" insurance on the Improvements and the
     Personal Property, in each case (A) in an amount equal to one hundred
     percent (100%) of the "Full Replacement Cost," which for purposes of this
     Agreement shall mean actual replacement value (exclusive of costs of
     excavations, foundations, underground utilities and footings) with a waiver
     of depreciation; (B) containing an agreed amount endorsement with respect
     to the Improvements and Personal Property waiving all co-insurance
     provisions; (C) providing for no deductible in excess of $100,000 for all
     such insurance coverage; and (D) if any of the Improvements or the use of
     the Property shall at any time constitute

<PAGE>
     legal non-conforming structures or uses, providing coverage for contingent
     liability from Operation of Building Laws, Demolition Costs and Increased
     Cost of Construction Endorsements and containing an "Ordinance or Law
     Coverage" or "Enforcement" endorsement. In addition, Borrower shall obtain:
     (y) if any portion of the Improvements is currently or at any time in the
     future located in a "special flood hazard area" designated by the Federal
     Emergency Management Agency, flood hazard insurance in an amount equal to
     the maximum amount of such insurance available under the National Flood
     Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 or the
     National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each may be amended; and
     (z) earthquake insurance in amounts and in form and substance reasonably
     satisfactory to Lender in the event the Property is located in an area with
     a high degree of seismic risk, provided that the insurance pursuant to
     clauses (y) and (z) hereof shall be on terms consistent with the
     comprehensive all risk insurance policy required under this subsection (i),
     provided, further, that the insurance pursuant to clause (z) hereof shall
     provide for no deductible in excess of 5% of the total insurable value
     (which includes annual rental value) of the properties insured under the
     applicable policy;

          (ii) Commercial General Liability insurance against claims for
     personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in
     or about the Property, with such insurance (A) to be on the so-called
     "occurrence" form with a general aggregate limit of not less than
     $2,000,000 and a per occurrence limit of not less than $1,000,000; (B) to
     continue at not less than the aforesaid limit until required to be changed
     by Lender in writing by reason of changed economic conditions making such
     protection inadequate; and (C) to cover at least the following hazards: (1)
     premises and operations; (2) products and completed operations; (3)
     independent contractors; (4) blanket contractual liability; and (5)
     contractual liability covering the indemnities contained in Article 12 and
     Article 14 hereof to the extent the same is available;

          (iii) loss of rents insurance or business income insurance, as
     applicable, (A) with loss payable to Lender; (B) covering all risks
     required to be covered by the insurance provided for in subsection (i)
     above; and (C) which provides that after the physical loss to the
     Improvements and Personal Property occurs, the loss of rents or income, as
     applicable, will be insured until such rents or income, as applicable,
     either return to the same level that existed prior to the loss, or the
     expiration of twenty-four (24) months, whichever first occurs, and
     notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period;
     and (D) which contains an extended period of indemnity endorsement which
     provides that after the physical loss to the Improvements and Personal
     Property has been repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured
     until such income either returns to the same level it was at prior to the
     loss, or the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date that the
     Property is repaired or replaced and operations are resumed, whichever
     first occurs, and notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the
     end of such period. The amount of such loss of rents or business income
     insurance, as applicable, shall be determined prior to the date hereof and
     at least once each year thereafter based on Borrower's reasonable estimate
     of the gross income from the Property for the succeeding period of coverage
     required above. All proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this subsection
     shall be held by Lender and shall be applied to the obligations secured by
     the Loan Documents from time to time and payable hereunder and under

                                      -67-
<PAGE>
     the Note; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed
     to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations secured by
     the Loan Documents on the respective dates of payment provided for in the
     Note, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents except to the extent such
     amounts are actually paid out of the proceeds of such loss of rents or
     business income insurance, as applicable.

          (iv)  at all times during which material structural construction,
     repairs or alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements, and
     only if the Property coverage form does not otherwise apply, (A) owner's
     contingent or protective liability insurance covering claims not covered by
     or under the terms or provisions of the above mentioned commercial general
     liability insurance policy; and (B) the insurance provided for in
     subsection (i) above written in a so-called Builder's Risk Completed Value
     form (1) on a non-reporting basis, (2) against "all risks" insured against
     pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3) including permission to occupy the
     Property, and (4) with an agreed amount endorsement waiving co-insurance
     provisions;

          (v)    workers' compensation, subject to the statutory limits of the
     State, and employer's liability insurance in respect of any work or
     operations on or about the Property, or in connection with the Property or
     its operation (if applicable);

          (vi)   comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if applicable, in
     amounts as shall be reasonably required by Lender on terms consistent with
     the commercial property insurance policy required under subsection (i)
     above;

          (vii)  excess liability insurance in an amount not less than
     $50,000,000 per occurrence on terms consistent with the commercial general
     liability insurance required under subsection (ii) above; and

          (viii) upon sixty (60) days' written notice, such other reasonable
     insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to time may
     reasonably request against such other insurable hazards which at the time
     are commonly insured against for property similar to the Property located
     in or around the region in which the Property is located.

     The Policies required to be maintained pursuant to clauses (i) through
(viii) above shall contain no exclusion for Losses resulting from acts of
terrorism as certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as the
same may be amended from time to time.

     (b)  All insurance provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall be obtained under
valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or in the singular,
the "POLICY"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to insurance
companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The Policies shall be
issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies authorized to do
business in the State and having a claims paying ability rating of "AA-" or
better by at least two Rating Agencies, one of which must be S&P or such other
Rating Agencies approved by Lender, provided, however, that if Borrower elects
to have its insurance coverage provided by a syndicate of insurers, then (i) if
such syndicate consists of 5 or more members, (A) at least 60% of the insurance
coverage (and 100% of the first layer of such coverage) shall be provided by
insurance companies having a claims paying ability rating of


                                      -68-
<PAGE>
"AA-" or better by at least two Rating Agencies, one of which must be S&P, and
(B) of the remaining 40% of the coverage, (I) 30% (of the total syndicate) shall
be provided by insurance companies having a claims paying ability rating of
"BBB-" or better by at least two Rating Agencies, one of which must be S&P, and
(II) the remaining 10% (of the total syndicate) shall be provided by insurance
carriers having a general policy rating of "A" or better and a financial class
of "XII" or better by A.M. Best Company, Inc., or (ii) if such syndicate
consists of four or fewer members, (A) at least 75% of the insurance coverage
(and 100% of the first layer of such coverage) shall be provided by insurance
companies having a claims paying ability rating of "AA" or better by at least
two Rating Agencies, one of which must be S&P, and (B) of the remaining 25% of
the coverage, (I) 15% (of the total syndicate) shall be provided by insurance
companies having a claims paying ability rating of "BBB-" or better by at least
two Rating Agencies, one of which must be S&P, and (II) the remaining 10% (of
the total syndicate) shall be provided by insurance carriers having a general
policy rating of "A" or better and a financial class of "XII" or better by A.M.
Best Company, Inc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Lender shall accept an "all-risk" Policy issued by Factory Mutual Insurance
Company ("Factory Mutual"), provided that (I) Factory Mutual maintains a general
policy rating of "A" or better and a financial class of "XII" or better by A.M.
Best Company, Inc. and a claims paying ability rating of "A+" or better by
Fitch, and (II) in connection with a Securitization, Lender confirms that, in
Lender's reasonable determination based on information from the Rating Agencies,
the ratings assigned to the portion or the Securitization represented by the
Loan will not be adversely affected as a result of the "all-risk" Policy being
issued by Factory Mutual The Policies described in Section 8.1(a) shall
designate Lender and its successors and assigns as additional insureds,
mortgagees and/or loss payee as deemed appropriate by Lender. Not less than ten
(10) days prior to the expiration dates of the Policies theretofore furnished to
Lender, renewal Policies accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of
payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "INSURANCE PREMIUMS") shall be
delivered by Borrower to Lender.

     (c)  Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the
Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall
otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only
the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(a).

     (d)  All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 8.1(a), except
for the Policy referenced in Section 8.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as the
insured and Lender as the additional insured, as its interests may appear, and
in the case of property damage, boiler and machinery, flood and earthquake
insurance, shall contain a so-called New York standard non-contributing
mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be
payable to Lender.

     (e)  All Policies provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall contain clauses or
endorsements to the effect that:

          (i)  no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower,
     or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with the
     provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of
     the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
     enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;


                                      -69-
<PAGE>


           (ii)     the Policies shall not be materially changed (other than to
     increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at least
     thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender;

          (iii)     the issuers thereof shall give written notice to Lender if
     the Policies have not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to its
     expiration; and

           (iv)     Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
     thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

     (f)  If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all
insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have the
right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protest its interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, obtaining such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion
deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the
Mortgage and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

     SECTION 8.2. CASUALTY

     If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by
fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower shall give prompt notice of
such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the
Restoration of the Property in accordance with Section 8.4, whether or not
Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4 (unless
Borrower has satisfied all conditions set forth in Section 8.4 and Lender does
not disburse the Net Proceeds, in which case Borrower shall have no obligation
under this Agreement to restore the Property). Borrower shall pay all costs of
such Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance. Lender
may, but shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made promptly by
Borrower. Borrower shall adjust all claims for Insurance Proceeds in
consultation with, and approval of, Lender; provided, however, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall have the exclusive right
to participate in the adjustment of all claims for Insurance Proceeds.

     SECTION 8.3. CONDEMNATION

     Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of the Property of which
Borrower has knowledge and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at
its expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on
or defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including but not
limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced


                                      -70-

<PAGE>
until any Award shall have been actually received and applied by Lender, after
the deduction of expenses of collection, to the reduction or discharge of the
Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the
condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award interest
at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Notes. If the Property or any
portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority, Borrower shall promptly
commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the Property and otherwise
comply with the provisions of Section 8.4, whether or not Lender makes any Net
Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4. If the Property is sold, through
foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender
shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the Notes shall
have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion
thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

     SECTION 8.4.   RESTORATION

     The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration of
the Property:

     (a)  If the Net Proceeds shall be less than $2,500,000.00 and the costs of
completing the Restoration shall be less than $2,500,000.00, the Net Proceeds
will be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided hat all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers to
Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily
complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

     (b)  If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than $2,500,000.00 or the
costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or greater than $2,500,000.00,
Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.4. The term "NET PROCEEDS" for purposes of
this Section 8.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds
received by Lender pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (viii) as a
result of a Casualty, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award as a result
of a Condemnation, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may be.

          (i)  The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for
     Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

               (A)  no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

               (B)  (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance Proceeds,
          less than thirty percent (30%) of the total floor area of the
          Improvements on the Property has been damaged, destroyed or rendered
          unusable as a result of a Casualty or (2) in the event the Net
          Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less than fifteen percent (15%) of
          the land constituting the Property is taken, such land is located
          along the perimeter or periphery of the Property, and no portion of
          the Improvements is located on such land;


                                      -71-
<PAGE>
               (C)  Leases covering in the aggregate at least seventy-five
          percent (75%) of the total rentable space in the Property which has
          been demised under executed and delivered Leases in effect as of the
          date of the occurrence of such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the
          case may be, and each Major Lease in effect as of such date shall
          remain in full force and effect during and after the completion of the
          Restoration without abatement of rent beyond the item required for
          Restoration;

               (D)  Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as
          reasonably practicable (but in no event later than ninety (90) days
          after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be,
          occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to satisfactory
          completion, with commencement defined for purposes hereof to mean the
          filing of the requisite applications and ancillary paperwork necessary
          to receive building permits;

               (E)  Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits,
          including all scheduled payments of principal and interest under the
          Note, which will be incurred with respect to the Property as a result
          of the occurrence of any such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the
          case may be, will be covered out of the insurance coverage referred to
          in Section 8.1(a)(iii) above;

               (F)  Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
          completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) six (6) months
          prior to the Maturity Date, (2) the earliest date required for such
          completion under the terms of any Leases or material agreements
          affecting the Property, (3) such time as may be required under
          applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or (4) the
          expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
          8.1(a)(iii);

               (G)  the Property and the use thereof after the Restoration will
          be in compliance with and permitted under all Legal Requirements;

               (H)  the Restoration shall be done and completed by Borrower in
          an expeditious and diligent fashion and in compliance with all
          applicable Legal Requirements;

               (I)  such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not
          result in the loss of access to the property or the Improvements,
          which access is otherwise not replaced via new improvements to the
          Property or an access easement (respectively);

               (J)  Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Lender
          a signed detailed budget approved in writing by Borrower's architect
          or engineer stating the estimated entire cost of completing the
          Restoration, which budget shall be reasonably acceptable to Lender;
          and

               (K)  the Net Proceeds together with any cash or cash equivalent
          deposited by Borrower with Lender are sufficient in Lender's
          reasonable judgment to cover the cost of the Restoration.

                                      -72-
<PAGE>
          (ii)  The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender until disbursements
     commence, and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this
     Section 8.4, shall constitute additional security for the Debt and other
     obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be disbursed
     by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from time to time during the
     course of the Restoration, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to Lender
     that (A) all the conditions precedent to such advance, including those set
     forth in Section 8.4(b)(i), have been satisfied, (B) all materials
     installed and work and labor performed (except to the extent that they are
     to be paid for out of the requested disbursement) in connection with the
     related Restoration item have been paid for in full, and (C) there exist no
     notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or
     notices of intention to file same, or any other liens or encumbrances or
     any nature whatsoever on the Property which have not either been fully
     bonded to the satisfaction of Lender (and in accordance with applicable
     Legal Requirements) and discharged of record or in the alternative fully
     insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the title company issuing the
     Title Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Insurance Proceeds
     from the Policies required to be maintained by Borrower pursuant to Section
     8.1(a)(iii) shall be controlled by Lender at all times, shall not be
     subject to the provisions of this Section 8.4 and shall be used solely for
     the payment of the obligations under the Loan Documents and Operating
     Expenses.

          (iii)  All plans and specifications required in connection with the
     Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in all respects
     by Lender and by an independent consulting engineer selected by Lender
     (the "RESTORATION CONSULTANT"). Lender shall have the use of the plans and
     specifications and all permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained
     in connection with the Restoration. The identity of the contractors,
     subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as the
     contracts in excess of $250,000 under which they have been engaged, shall
     be subject to prior review and acceptance by Lender and the Restoration
     Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with
     making the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration, including, without
     limitation, reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and the Restoration
     Consultant's fees, shall be paid by Borrower.

          (iv)  In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
     the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually
     incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as
     certified by the Restoration Consultant, minus the Restoration Retainage.
     The term "Restoration Retainage" shall mean an amount equal to ten percent
     (10%) of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the
     Restoration, as certified by the Restoration Consultant, until the
     Restoration has been completed. The Restoration Retainage shall be reduced
     to five percent (5%) of the costs incurred upon receipt by Lender of
     satisfactory evidence that fifty percent (50%) of the Restoration has been
     completed. The Restoration Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section 8.4(b), be less
     than the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors,
     subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The Restoration
     Retainage shall not be released until the Restoration Consultant certifies
     to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the
     provisions of this Section 8.4(b) and that all approvals necessary for the
     re-occupancy and use of the Property have been obtained from all


                                      -73-

<PAGE>
     appropriate Governmental Authorities, and Lender receives evidence
     satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration have been paid in
     full or will be paid in full out of the Restoration Retainage; provided,
     however, that Lender will release the portion of the Restoration Retainage
     being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or materialman
     engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon which the Restoration
     Consultant certifies to Lender that the contractor, subcontractor or
     materialman has satisfactorily completed all work and has supplied all
     materials in accordance with the provisions of the contractor's,
     subcontactor's or materialman's contract, the contractor, subcontractor or
     materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of
     all sums due to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be
     reasonably requested by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title
     Insurance Policy, and Lender receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance
     Policy insuring the continued priority of the lien of the Mortgage and
     evidence of payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If
     required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Restoration
     Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has issued
     a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor, subcontractor
     or materialman.

          (v)    Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net
     Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

          (vi)   If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance
     thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in consultation with
     the Restoration Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the
     costs which are estimated by the Restoration Consultant to be incurred in
     connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit
     the deficiency (the "NET PROCEEDS DEFICIENCY") with Lender before any
     further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds
     Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be
     disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration on
     the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and
     until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) shall constitute
     additional security for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan
     Documents.

          (vii)  The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
     balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender after
     the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has
     been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b),
     and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs
     incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full, shall
     be remitted by Lender to Borrower (or as directed by Borrower), provided no
     Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing under the
     Note, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

     (c)  All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 8.4(b)(vii) may (x) be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority
and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper,


                                      -74-


<PAGE>
or, (y) at the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole
or in part, to Borrower for such purposes and upon such conditions as Lender
shall designate.

     (d) In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, or other transfer or title
to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt, all right,
title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in force concerning
the Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the
purchaser at such foreclosure, Lender or other transferee in the event of such
other transfer of title.

                                   ARTICLE 9
                                 RESERVE FUNDS

     SECTION 9.1.  MIZUHO TERMINATION RESERVE

     (a)  Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent (the "MIZUHO TERMINATION RESERVE ACCOUNT") into which
Borrower shall deposit on the date hereof $2,300,000.000. Amounts on deposit in
the Debt Service Reserve Account shall hereinafter be referred to as "MIZUHO
TERMINATION RESERVE FUNDS".

     (b)  So long as no Event of Default exists, Lender shall disburse to
Borrower on each Payment Date the sum of $38,333.33 from the Mizuho Termination
Reserve Funds.

     SECTION 9.2.  REPLACEMENTS

     (a)  On an ongoing basis throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower shall
make capital repairs, replacements and improvements necessary to keep the
Property in good order and repair and in a good marketable condition or prevent
deterioration of the Property, including, but not limited to, those repairs,
replacements and improvements more particularly described in (i) the Physical
Conditions Report prepared in connection with the closing of the Loan and (ii)
Schedule II attached hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the
"REPLACEMENTS"). Borrower shall complete all Replacements in a good and
workmanlike manner as soon as commercially reasonable after commencing to make
each such Replacement.

     (b)  Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent to fund the Replacements (the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE
ACCOUNT") into which Borrower shall deposit on the date hereof $ -0-. In
addition, Borrower shall deposit (i) $26,935.79 into the Replacement Reserve
Account on each Payment Date commencing with the Payment Date in August, 2003
and continuing through and including the Payment Date occurring in August, 2005
and (ii) $9,158.17 into the Replacement Reserve Account on each Payment Date
thereafter, including, without limitation, during the Extension Term, if
applicable (the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE MONTHLY DEPOSIT"). Amounts so deposited
shall hereinafter be referred to as "REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUNDS." Lender may, in
its reasonable discretion, based on its good faith belief that additional funds
are necessary, adjust the Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit from time to time
to an amount sufficient to maintain the proper maintenance and operation of the
Property. In the event Lender shall at any time increase the Replacement Reserve
Monthly Deposit, Borrower may, at its election, request that Lender obtain, at
the sole cost and expense of Borrower, a Physical Conditions Report prepared by
an engineer selected by Lender in its reasonable discretion, in which case the
Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit


                                      -75-
<PAGE>
shall be adjusted by Lender based on the results of such report, provided that
in no event shall such amounts be reduced below the initial amount of the
Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit set forth in herein.

     (c)  (i)  In lieu of making deposits into the Replacement Reserve Account,
Borrower may delivery to Lender a letter of credit that satisfies each of the
criteria set forth in the definition of Letter of Credit in this Agreement and
is in an amount equal to the product of twelve (12) times the amount of the then
applicable Replacement Reserve Month Deposit (the "RESERVE LETTER OF CREDIT").
If, at any time, Borrower fails to maintain the Reserve Letter of Credit in such
amount, Borrower shall deposit the Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit into the
Replacement Reserve Account in accordance with the terms of Section 9.2(b)
hereof.

          (ii) Borrower shall have no draw or reduction rights with respect to
the Reserve Letter of Credit and no rights to disbursement from any of the
proceeds of the Reserve Letter of Credit. Lender have the same rights, and upon
the same terms and conditions, to draw down the Reserve Letter of Credit and
apply the proceeds thereof as Lender would have to apply (rather than disburse
to Borrower) the Replacement Reserve Funds under the terms of this Agreement.

          (iii) At its election, Borrower may obtain a release of the Reserve
Letter of Credit provided that (A) Borrower provides no less than ten (10)
Business Days' prior written notice to Lender of the proposed release, (B) on or
prior to the release of the Reserve Letter of Credit, Borrower deposits into the
Replacement Reserve Account the cash amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
face amount of the Reserve Letter of Credit and (C) following such release of
the Reserve Letter of Credit, the provisions of this Section 9.2(c) shall no
longer be of any force or effect and Borrower shall comply with the terms of
Section 9.2(b) hereof.

          (iv) Lender shall release and return the Reserve Letter of Credit to
Borrower upon satisfaction of the same conditions for release of the balance of
the Replacement Reserve Funds as set forth in Section 9.5(k) hereof.

          (v)  In the event that there are any sums on deposit in the
Replacement Reserve Account as of the date that Lender receives the Reserve
Letter of Credit, Lender shall promptly disburse such sums to Borrower.

     SECTION 9.3.   TENANT IMPROVEMENTS/LEASING COMMISSIONS

     (a)  Borrower hereby agrees to (a) perform, or cause to be performed,
tenant improvements required under the Latham Lease and the MoFo Lease
(collectively, the "TENANT IMPROVEMENTS"), and (b) pay the costs of leasing
commissions incurred by Borrower in connection with the leasing of the Property
or a portion thereof (collectively, "LEASING COMMISSIONS").

     (b)  Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent to fund Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions
(the ""LEASING RESERVE ACCOUNT") into which Borrower shall deposit on the date
hereof $7,395,002.00. In addition, Borrower shall deposit with Lender into the
Leasing Reserve Account (i) on each Payment Date, the applicable TI/LC Monthly
Deposit and (ii) any sum or termination fee payable to Borrower

                                      -76-
<PAGE>
in connection with any Tenant's election to exercise any early termination
option contained in either the Latham Lease or the MoFo Lease (the "TERMINATION
FEE DEPOSIT") on the date of Borrower's receipt thereof. Amounts so deposited
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "LEASING RESERVE FUNDS."

     SECTION 9.4    REQUIRED WORK

Borrower shall diligently pursue all Replacement and Tenant Improvements (the
"REQUIRED WORK") to completion in accordance with the following requirements:

     (a)  Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all contracts or
work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors, contractors
or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the Required
Work to the extent such contracts or work orders exceed $250,000. Upon Lender's
request, Borrower shall assign any contract to Lender.

     (b)  In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that any
Required Work is not being or has not been performed in a workmanlike or timely
manner, and upon Borrower's failure to cure such condition within fifteen (15)
days of notice thereof from Lender, Lender shall have the option to withhold
disbursement for such unsatisfactory Required Work and to proceed under existing
contracts or to contract with third parties to complete such Required Work and
to apply the Replacement Reserve Funds toward the labor and materials necessary
to complete such Required Work, without providing any further notice to Borrower
and to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender upon an Event of
Default hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender shall not be required
to provide any advance notice to Borrower in the event that Lender determines
in good faith that the performance of such Required Work is of an emergency
nature.

     (c)  In order to facilitate Lender's completion of the Required Work,
Borrower grants Lender the right to enter onto the Property and perform any and
all work and labor necessary to complete the Required Work and/or employ
watchmen to protect the Property from damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lender shall provide Borrower written notice of who Lender intends shall perform
any Required Work or which watchmen shall protect the Property from Damage as
described in Section 9.4(b) or this Section 9.4(c). If within three Business
Days after receipt of such notice, Borrower provides written notice to Lender
that, in Sponsor's reasonable judgment, the use of such entities or individuals
to perform the work or protect the Property could adversely affect Sponsor's
ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code, Lender
shall not employ such entities or individuals, and in such case the Lender shall
repeat the process described above, and the Borrower shall have the same consent
rights as described above. Any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by Lender
as a result of this notice process shall be paid by Borrower. In addition,
Lender shall not be required to provide any notice to Borrower nor shall
Borrower have any veto rights over the entities or individuals selected by
Lender if Lender determines, in its good faith reasonable discretion, that an
emergency situation exists at the Property. All sums so expended by Lender, to
the extent not from the Reserve Funds, shall be deemed to have been advanced
under the Loan to Borrower and secured by the Mortgage. To the extent that
Lender has the right to enter the Property and to perform work under Section
9.4(b) above, for this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints Lender its true
and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete or


                                      -77-
<PAGE>


undertake the Required Work in the name of Borrower upon Borrower's failure to
do so in a workmanlike and timely manner. Such power of attorney shall be
deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. Borrower
empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any of the Reserve Funds
for the purpose of making or completing the Required Work; (ii) to make such
additions, changes and corrections to the Required Work as shall be necessary
or desirable to complete the Required Work; (iii) to employ such contractors,
subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be required for such
purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which
are or may become Liens against the Property, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the Required Work, or for clearance of title;
(v) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which
may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend
all actions or proceedings in connection with the Property or the
rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to do any and every act
which Borrower might do on its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this
Agreement.

     (d)  Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall: (i) make Lender responsible for
making or completing the Required Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds in
addition to the Reserve Funds to make or complete any Required Work;
(iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the Required Work; or (iv) obligate
Lender to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Required
Work.

     (e)  Provided Lender gives Borrower notice at least 1 day in advance,
Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's bonded and insured agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect,
or inspector) or third parties performing Required Work pursuant to this
Section 9.4 to enter onto the Property during normal business hours (subject to
the rights of tenants under their Leases and provided Landlord uses reasonable
efforts to minimize interference with such tenants) to inspect the progress of
any Required Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to
examine all plans and shop drawings relating to such Required Work which are or
may be kept at the Property, and to complete any Required Work made pursuant to
this Section 9.4. Borrower shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to
cooperate with Lender and Lender's representatives or such other persons
described above in connection with inspections described in this Section 9.4 or
the completion of Required Work pursuant to this Section 9.4. Other than in
connection with what Lender determines to be an emergency situation, Lender
agrees not to conduct any invasive testing.

     (f)  Lender may, to the extent any Required Work would reasonably require
an inspection of the Property, inspect the Property at Borrower's expense prior
to making a disbursement of the Reserve Funds in order to verify completion of
the Required Work for which payment or reimbursement is sought. With respect to
any such disbursement request greater than or equal to $50,000, Borrower shall
pay Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding $1,000 for each such
inspection. Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by an
appropriate independent qualified professional selected by Lender and/or may
require a copy of a certificate of completion by an independent qualified
professional acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of the Reserve
Funds. Borrower shall pay the expense of the inspection as required hereunder,
whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified
professional.



                                      -78-

<PAGE>
     (g)  The Required Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any
other item comprising a part of any Required Work shall be constructed,
installed or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's,
materialman's or other Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

     (h)  Before each disbursement of the Replacement Reserve Funds in excess
of $35,000, Lender may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of
title to the Property effective to the date of disbursement, which search shows
that no mechanic's or materialmen's or other Liens of any nature have been
placed against the Property since the date of recordation of the Mortgage and
that title to the Property is free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted
Encumbrances).

     (i)  All Required Work shall comply with all Legal Requirements and
applicable insurance requirements including, without limitation, applicable
building codes, special use permits, environmental regulations, and
requirements of insurance underwriters.

     (j)  Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all rights and claims Borrower may
have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such rights or
claims unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

     SECTION 9.5.  RELEASE OF RESERVE FUNDS

     (a)  Upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of the
requirements set forth in this Agreement, Lender shall disburse to Borrower
amounts from (i) the Replacement Reserve Account to pay for the actual costs of
any approved Replacements or (ii) the Leasing Reserve Account to the extent
necessary to reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of Tenant Improvements
and/or Leasing Commissions incurred, provided that (A) such Leasing Commissions
are reasonable and customary for properties similar to the Property and the
portion of the Property leased for which such Leasing Commissions are due, and
(B) the amount of such Leasing Commissions are determined pursuant to
arm's-length transactions between Borrower and any leasing agent to which a
Leasing Commission is due. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event
shall Lender be required to (x) disburse funds from any of the Reserve Accounts
if an Event of Default exists, or (y) disburse funds from the Replacement
Reserve Account to pay for the costs of routine repairs or maintenance to the
Property or for Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions.

     (b)  Each request for disbursement from any of the Reserve Accounts shall
be on a form provided or approved by Lender and shall (i) include copies of
invoices for all items or materials purchased and all labor or services
provided and (ii) specify (A) the Required Work for which the disbursement is
requested, (B) the quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Required
Work includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (C) the price of
all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Required Work other
than the purchase or replacement of specific items, and (D) the cost of all
contracted labor or other services applicable to each Required Work for which
such request for disbursement is made and (iii) include, if such request for
disbursement is in connection with Tenant Improvements, a certificate from the
Tenant(s) for which the Tenant Improvements have been performed stating that
such Tenant

                                      -79-

<PAGE>
Improvements have been completed in a manner satisfactory and acceptable to
such Tenant(s) and (unless disbursement is requested pursuant to Section
9.5(d)), such Tenant(s) has accepted the premises demised under the applicable
Lease(s), and containing such other information as Lender may require, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender, and/or if such request for
disbursement is in connection with Leasing Commissions, a certificate from the
leasing agent that no further sums are due to it in connection with the
applicable Lease. With each request Borrower shall certify that all Required
Work has been or will be performed in accordance with all Legal Requirements.
With each request Borrower shall certify that all Required Work has been
performed in accordance with all Legal Requirements. Except as provided in
Section 9.5(d), each request for disbursement shall be made only after
completion of the Replacement or Tenant Improvement (or the portion thereof
completed in accordance with Section 9.5(d), as applicable, for which
disbursement is requested. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence satisfactory
to Lender in its reasonable judgment of such completion or performance.

     (c)  Borrower shall use each disbursement to pay all invoices in connection
with the Required Work with respect to which such disbursement is requested or,
at the request of Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks, payable to Borrower
and the contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic, subcontractor or other
party to whom payment is due in connection with the Required Work. Lender may
require in its sole discretion a conditional waiver of lien (conditioned only on
payment) from each Person receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement of
the Reserve Funds. In addition, as a condition to any disbursement, Lender may
require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each contractor, supplier,
materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives payment in an amount equal
to or greater than $10,000 for completion of its work or delivery of its
materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder shall conform to all Legal
Requirements and shall cover all work performed and materials supplied
(including equipment and fixtures) for the Property by that contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman through the date covered by
the current disbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such
contractor, supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a
joint check, the release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by
the previous release of funds request). In the case of Leasing Commissions,
payment shall be made to any leasing agent to which a Leasing Commission is due
in the amount of invoices submitted by such leasing agent, provided all of the
other conditions for disbursements for such Leasing Commissions are satisfied in
the judgment of Lender.

     (d)  If (i) the cost of any item of Required Work exceeds $50,000, (ii) the
contractor performing such Required Work requires periodic payments pursuant to
terms of a written contract, and (iii) Lender has approved in writing in advance
such periodic payments, a request for disbursement from the Reserve Accounts may
be made after completion of a portion of the work under such contract, provided
(A) such contract requires payment upon completion of such portion of work, (B)
the materials for which the request is made are on site at the Property and are
properly secured or have been installed in the Property, (C) all other
conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been satisfied, and (D) in
the case of a Replacement, funds remaining in the Replacement Reserve Account,
are in Lender's judgment, sufficient to complete such Replacement and other
Replacements when required.


                                      -80-
<PAGE>


     (e)  Borrower shall not make a request for, nor shall Lender have any
obligation to make, any disbursement from any Reserve Account more frequently
than once in any calendar month and (except in connection with the final
disbursement) in any amount less than the lesser of (i) $10,000 or (ii) the
total cost of the Required Work or Leasing Commission for which the
disbursement is requested.

     (f)  [Intentionally omitted].

     (g)  In the event Borrower request a disbursement from the Replacement
Reserve Account to pay for the actual cost of labor or materials used in
connection with repairs or improvements other than the Replacements specified
in the Physical Conditions Report prepared in connection with the closing of
the Loan (an "ADDITIONAL REPLACEMENT"), Borrower shall disclose in writing to
Lender the reason why funds in the Replacement Reserve Account should be used
to pay for such Additional Replacement. If Lender determines in its reasonable
discretion that (i) such Additional Replacement is of the type intended to be
covered by the Replacement Reserve Account, (ii) [intentionally omitted], (iii)
costs for such Additional Replacement are reasonable, (iv) the funds in the
Replacement Reserve Account are sufficient to pay for such Additional
Replacement and all other Replacements for the Property specified in the
Physical Conditions Report, and (iv) all other conditions for disbursement
under this Agreement have been met, Lender shall disburse funds from the
Replacement Reserve Account.

     (h)  Lender's disbursement of any Reserve Funds or other acknowledgment of
completion of any Required Work in a manner satisfactory to Lender shall not be
deemed a certification or warranty by Lender to any Person that the Required
Work has been completed in accordance with Legal Requirements.

     (i)  If the funds in any Reserve Account should exceed the amount of
payments actually applied by Lender for the purposes of the account, Lender in
its sole discretion shall either return any excess to Borrower or credit such
excess against future payments to be made to that Reserve Account. In allocating
any such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on Lender's records as
being the owner of the Property. If at any time Lender reasonably determines
that the Reserve Funds are not or will not be sufficient to make the required
payments, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall
pay to Lender any amount necessary to make up the deficiency within ten (10)
days notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment thereof.

     (j)  The insufficiency of any balance in any of the Reserve Accounts shall
not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill any preservation and
maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

     (k)  Upon payment in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if
any, in the Replacement Reserve Account shall be returned to Borrower or the
Person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no other
party shall have any right or claim thereto.


     (l)  Upon the earlier to occur of (i) the completion of all Tenant
Improvements and the full performance by the leasing agent of its obligations
with respect to any Leasing


                                      -81-
<PAGE>

Commissions, as verified by Lender in its reasonable discretion, or (ii) the
payment in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if any, in the
Leasing Reserve Account shall be returned to Borrower or the Person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no other party shall
have any right or claim thereto.

     (m)  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, Borrower
shall not be entitled to the disbursement of more than $6,007,242 with respect
to Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commission due with respect to the Latham
Lease, and more than $7,551,798.00 with respect to Tenant Improvements and
Leasing Commission due with respect to the MoFo Lease.

      SECTION 9.6.  TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS

     Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent sufficient to discharge Borrower's obligations for the
payment of Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1
hereof (the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT") into which Borrower shall
deposit on the date hereof $1,469,518.91, which amount, when added to the
required monthly deposits set forth in the next sentence, is sufficient to make
the payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums as required herein. Borrower shall
deposit into the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account on each Payment Date (a)
one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender estimates will be payable during the next
ensuing twelve (12) months or such higher amount necessary to accumulate with
Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior
to the earlier of (i) the date that the same will become delinquent and (ii)
the date that additional charges or interest will accrue due to the non-payment
thereof, and (b) except to the extent Lender has waived the insurance escrow
because the insurance required hereunder is maintained under a blanket
insurance Policy acceptable to Lender in accordance with Section 8.1(c),
one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be payable
during the next ensuing twelve (12) months for the renewal of the coverage
afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof or such higher amount
necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance
Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies
(said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "TAX AND INSURANCE
RESERVE FUNDS"). Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds to
payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower
pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof. In making any disbursement from
the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account, Lender may do so according to any bill,
statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office or tax lien
service (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance
Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or
estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax
lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Funds shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to
Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof, Lender shall, in its sole discretion,
return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to
be made to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account. In allocating any such
excess, Lender may deal with the person shown on Lender's records as being the
owner of the Property. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Reserve
Account after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower or
the person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no
other party shall have any right or claim thereto. If at any time Lender
reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds are not or will
not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in
(a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of


                                      -82-
<PAGE>
such determination and Borrower shall pay to Lender any amount necessary to
make up the deficiency within ten (10) days after notice from Lender to
Borrower requesting payment thereof.

     SECTION 9.7.   INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

     SECTION 9.8.   OPERATING EXPENSES; EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES

     (a)  Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent into which Borrower shall deposit, on each Payment Date
during the term of the Loan, funds sufficient to pay all Operating Expenses
required to be incurred during the following month in accordance with the Annual
Budget approved by Lender (the "OPERATING EXPENSE RESERVE ACCOUNT.") Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the "OPERATING EXPENSE RESERVE
FUNDS." Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, sums from
the Operating Expense Reserve Account shall be disbursed by Lender to Borrower
following receipt and approval of Borrower's written request for the payment of
such Operating Expenses.

     (b)  Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent into which Borrower shall deposit, on each Payment Date
during the term of the Loan, funds sufficient to pay any Extraordinary Expenses,
if any, for the following month which have been approved by Lender (the
"EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE RESERVE ACCOUNT.") Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter
be referred to as the "EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE RESERVE FUNDS." Provided no Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, sums from the Extraordinary Expense
Reserve Account shall be disbursed by Lender to Borrower following receipt and
approval of Borrower's written request for the payment of such Extraordinary
Expenses.

     SECTION 9.9.   RESERVE FUNDS GENERALLY

     (a)  Borrower shall be entitled to interest on all Reserve Accounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the funds in the Reserve Accounts shall not be
invested except in Permitted Investments in accordance with the terms of Section
10.1(b) hereof, and all interest earned or accrued thereon shall be for the
account of the Borrower and shall be allocated in a manner consistent with
Section 10.2(c) hereof.

     (b)  Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security interest
in, and assigns and pledges to Lender, each of the Reserve Accounts and any and
all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts as
additional security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in
accordance herewith, the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. The provisions of this Section 9.9 are
intended to give Lender or any subsequent holder of the Loan "control" of the
Reserve Accounts within the meaning of the UCC.

     (c)  The Reserve Accounts and any and all Reserve Funds now or hereafter
deposited in the Reserve Accounts shall be subject to the exclusive dominion and
control of Lender, which shall hold the Reserve Accounts and any or all Reserve
Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. Borrower shall have no right of withdrawal
from the Reserve Accounts or any other right or power with respect to the

                                      -83-
<PAGE>
Reserve Accounts or any or all of the Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited
in the Reserve Accounts, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

     (d)  Lender shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Borrower, without
charge, an annual accounting of each Reserve Account in the normal format of
Lender or its loan servicer, showing credits and debits to such Reserve Account
and the purpose for which each debit to each Reserve Account was made.

     (e)  As long as no Event of Default has occurred, Lender shall make
disbursements from the Reserve Accounts in accordance with this Agreement. All
such disbursements shall be deemed to have been expressly pre-authorized by
Borrower, and shall not be deemed to constitute the exercise by Lender of any
remedies against Borrower unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and Lender has expressly stated in writing its intent to proceed to
exercise its remedies as a secured party, pledgee or lienholder with respect to
the Reserve Accounts.

     (f)  If any Event of Default occurs, Borrower shall immediately lose all of
its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve Accounts until the earlier
to occur of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured to Lender's
satisfaction, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt. Upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default, Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies
as a secured party, pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Reserve Accounts.
Without limitation of the foregoing, upon any Event of Default, Lender may use
and disburse the Reserve Funds (or any portion thereof) for any of the following
purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited to, principal
prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial
prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses, fees,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item from any of the Reserve Accounts as
required or permitted under this Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that any such application of funds shall
not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default. Without limiting any other
provisions hereof, each of the remedial actions described in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable exercise of
Lender's rights and remedies as a secured party with respect to the Reserve
Funds and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a
foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve Funds to effect a
cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any specific order of
priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's rights and remedies under this
Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents shall not in any way
prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate and complete a foreclosure under
the Mortgage.

     (g)  The Reserve Funds shall not constitute escrow or trust funds and may
be commingled with other monies held by Lender. Notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, Lender may commingle in one or more Eligible Accounts
any and all funds controlled by Lender, including, without limitation, funds
pledged in favor of Lender by other borrowers, whether for the same purposes as
the Reserve Accounts or otherwise. Without limiting any other provisions of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Reserve Accounts may be

                                      -84-
<PAGE>
established and held in such name or names as Lender or its loan servicer, as
agent for Lender, shall deem appropriate, including, without limitation, in the
name of Lender or such loan servicer as agent for Lender. In the case of any
Reserve Account which is held in a commingled account, Lender or its loan
servicer, as applicable, shall maintain records sufficient to enable it to
determine at all times which portion of such account is related to the Loan.
The Reserve Accounts are solely for the protection of Lender. With respect to
the Reserve Accounts, Lender shall have no responsibility beyond the allowance
of due credit for the sums actually received by Lender or beyond the
reimbursement or payment of the costs and expenses for which such accounts were
established in accordance with their terms. Upon assignment of the Loan by
Lender, any Reserve Funds shall be turned over to the assignee and any
responsibility of Lender as assignor shall terminate. The requirements of this
Agreement concerning Reserve Accounts in no way supersede, limit or waive any
other rights or obligations of the parties under any of the Loan Documents or
under applicable law.

     (h)  Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the Reserve
Accounts or the Reserve Funds deposited therein or permit any Lien to attach
thereto, except for the security interest granted in this Section 9.9, or any
levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements, except those naming
Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

     (i)  Borrower will maintain the security interest created by this Section
9.9 as a first priority perfected security interest and will defend the right,
title and interest of Lender in and to the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve
Funds against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. At any time and
from time to time, upon the written request of Lender, and at the sole expense
of Borrower, Borrower will promptly an duly execute and deliver such further
instruments and documents and will take such further actions as Lender
reasonably may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                CASH MANAGEMENT

     SECTION 10.1.  LOCKBOX ACCOUNT AND CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT

     (a)  Borrower acknowledges and confirms that Borrower has established, and
Borrower covenants that it shall maintain, (i) pursuant to the Lockbox
Agreement, a non-interest bearing Eligible Account into which Borrower shall,
and shall cause Manager to, deposit or cause to be deposited, all Rents and
other revenue from the Property (such account, all funds at any time on deposit
therein and any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds
therein, are referred to herein as the "LOCKBOX ACCOUNT"), and (ii) an interest
bearing Eligible Account into which funds in the Lockbox Account shall be
transferred pursuant to the terms of Section 10.2(b) hereof (such account, the
sub-accounts thereof, all funds at any time on deposit therein and any proceeds,
replacements or substitutions of such account or funds therein, are referred to
herein as the "CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT").

     (b)  The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall each be in the
name of Borrower for the benefit of Lender, provided that Borrower shall be the
owner of all funds on


                                      -85-
<PAGE>
deposit in such accounts for federal and applicable state and local tax
purposes. Sums on deposit in the Cash Management Account (or any Reserve
Account) shall not be invested except in such Permitted Investments as directed
by Borrower and all income earned thereon shall be the income of Borrower and be
applied to and become part of the Cash Management Account, to be disbursed in
accordance with this Article 10. So long as no Event of Default exists, Borrower
shall be entitled to direct such investment not more frequently than once per
calendar month, and shall provide Lender with five (5) Business Days prior
notice with respect to any direction. Neither Lockbox Bank nor Lender shall have
any liability for any loss resulting from the investment of funds in Permitted
Investments in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

     (c)  The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall be subject to
the exclusive dominion and control of Lender and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other party claiming on
behalf of, or through, Borrower or Manager, shall have any right of withdrawal
therefrom or any other right or power with respect thereto.

     (d)  Borrower agrees to pay the customary fees and expenses of Lockbox Bank
(incurred in connection with maintaining the Lockbox Account) and Lender
(incurred in connection with maintaining the Lockbox Account) and any successors
thereto in connection therewith, as separately agreed by them from time to time.

     (e)  Lender shall be responsible for the performance only of such duties
with respect to the Cash Management Account as are specifically set forth
herein, and no duty shall be implied from any provision hereof. Lender shall not
be under any obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve it in
expense or liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof, or to
advance any of its own monies. Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender and its
directors, employees, officers and agents harmless from and against any loss,
cost or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by such parties in connection with the Cash Management
Account other than such as result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Lender or intentional nonperformance by Lender of its obligations
under this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.2.  DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS

     (a)  Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that:

          (i)  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Borrower shall
     notify and advise each Tenant under each Lease (whether such Lease is
     presently effective or executed after the date hereof) to send directly to
     the Lockbox all payments of Rents or any other item payable under such
     Leases pursuant to an instruction letter in the form of Exhibit D attached
     hereto (a "TENANT DIRECTION LETTER"). If Borrower fails to provide any such
     notice (and without prejudice to Lender's rights with respect to such
     default), Lender shall have the right, and Borrower hereby grants to Lender
     a power of attorney (which power of attorney shall be coupled with an
     interest and irrevocable so long as any portion of the Debt remains
     outstanding), to sign and deliver a Tenant Direction Letter;

                                      -86-
<PAGE>


          (ii)  Borrower shall, and shall cause Manager to, instruct all
     Persons that maintain open accounts with Borrower or Manager with respect
     to the property or with whom Borrower or Manager does business on an
     "accounts receivable" basis with respect to the Property to deliver all
     payments due under such accounts to the Lockbox. Neither Borrower nor
     Manager shall direct any such Person to make payments due under such
     accounts in any other manner;

          (iii) All Rents or other income from Property shall (A) be deemed
     additional security for payment of the Debt and shall be held in trust for
     the benefit, and as the property, of Lender, (B) not be commingled with any
     other funds or property of Borrower or Manager, and (C) if received by
     Borrower or Manager notwithstanding the delivery of a Tenant Direction
     Letter, be deposited in the Lockbox Account within two (2) Business Day of
     receipt;

          (iv)  Without the prior written consent of Lender, so long as any
     portion of the Debt remains outstanding, neither Borrower not Manager shall
     terminate, amend, revoke or modify any Tenant Direction Letter in any
     manner whatsoever or direct or cause any Tenant to pay any amount in any
     manner other than as provided in the related Tenant Direction Letter; and

          (v)  So long as any portion of the Debt remains outstanding, neither
     Borrower, Manager not any other Person shall open or maintain any accounts
     other than the Lockbox Account into which revenues from the ownership and
     operation of the Property are deposited. The foregoing shall not prohibit
     Borrower from utilizing one or more separate accounts for the disbursement
     or retention of funds that have been transferred to Borrower pursuant to
     the express terms of this Agreement.

     (b)  Borrower hereby irrevocably authorized Lender to transfer, or cause
to be transferred, and Lender shall transfer, on each Business Date by wire
transfer or other method of transfer mutually agreeable to Lockbox Bank and
Lender of immediately available funds, all collected and available balances in
the Lockbox Account to the Cash Management Account to be held until disbursed
by Lender pursuant to Section 10.2(c).

     (c)  On each Payment Date (and if such day is not a Business Day, then the
immediately preceding day which is a Business Day) commencing the month during
which the first Payment Date occurs, Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes
Lender to withdraw or allocate to the sub-accounts of the Cash Management
Account, as the case may be, amounts received in the Cash Management Account,
in each case to the extent that sufficient funds remain therefor:

          (i)   funds sufficient to pay the monthly deposits to the Tax and
     Insurance Reserve Account shall be allocated to the Tax and Insurance
     Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance with Section 9.6;

          (ii)  funds sufficient to pay the Monthly Payment Amount shall be
     withdrawn and paid to Lender;



                                      -87-
<PAGE>


          (iii)     funds sufficient to pay the Replacement Reserve Monthly
     Deposit shall be allocated to the Replacement Reserve Account to be held
     and disbursed in accordance with Section 9.5;

           (iv)     funds sufficient to pay any interest accruing at the
     Default Rate, late payment charges, if any, and any other sums due and
     payable to Lender under any of the Loan Documents, shall be withdrawn and
     paid to Lender and applied against such items;

            (v)     funds sufficient to pay Lockbox Bank for all costs and
     expenses incurred by Lockbox Bank in connection with the maintenance and
     administration of the Lockbox Account;

           (vi)     funds sufficient to pay Operating Expenses (to the extent
     actually incurred) for the following month incurred in accordance with the
     related Annual Budget shall be allocated to the Operating Expense Reserve
     Account to be held and disbursed in accordance with Section 9.8;

          (vii)     funds sufficient to pay the applicable TI/LC Monthly
     Deposit shall be allocated to the Leasing Reserve Account to be held and
     disbursed in accordance with Section 9.5;

         (viii)     funds sufficient to pay any Extraordinary Expenses for the
     following month which have been approved by Lender shall be allocated to
     the Extraordinary Expense Account to be held and disbursed in accordance
     with Section 9.8;

           (ix)     provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, funds to pay the debt service on the Mezzanine Loan pursuant
     to the direction letter from Mezzanine Lender;

            (x)     provided no Event of Default exist and Lender has not
     received written notice from Mezzanine Lender that a Mezzanine Event of
     Default exists, funds in an amount equal to the Junior Subordinated
     Management Fee shall be disbursed to Manager, it being understood that if
     there are insufficient funds to pay the Junior Subordinated Management Fee
     in any month, such unpaid fee (or portion thereof) shall be waived by
     Manager and Manager shall have no rights to pursue such unpaid fee (or
     portion thereof);

           (xi)     provided no Event of Default exists, if Lender has received
     written notice from Mezzanine Lender that a Mezzanine Event of Default
     exists, funds in an amount equal to the balance (if any) remaining on
     deposit in the Cash Management Account after the foregoing withdrawals and
     allocations shall be transferred to Mezzanine Lender; and

          (xii)     provided no Event of Default exist and Lender has not
     received written notice from Mezzanine Lender that a Mezzanine Event of
     Default exists, the balance (if any) remaining on deposit in the Cash
     Management Account after the foregoing withdrawals and allocations shall
     be transferred to Borrower pursuant to written instructions provided by
     Borrower to Lender from time to time. Lender acknowledges that Borrower
     will make distributions from such to its equity holders in such amounts as




                                      -88-

<PAGE>
     are necessary for Sponsor to maintain its qualification as a real estate
     investment trust for United States federal tax purposes and to avoid the
     imposition of income or excise taxes.

     (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Borrower acknowledges
that Borrower is responsible for monitoring the sufficiency of funds deposited
in the Cash Management Account and that Borrower is liable for any deficiency in
available funds, irrespective of whether Borrower has received any account
statement, notice or demand from Lender or Lender's servicer. If the amount on
deposit in the Cash Management Account is insufficient to make all of the
withdrawals and allocations described in Section 10.2(c)(i) through (viii)
above, Borrower shall deposit such deficiency into the Cash Management Account
within five (5) days (provided that such five day period shall not constitute a
grace period for any default or Event of Default under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document based on a failure to satisfy any monetary obligation
provided in any Loan Document).

     (e)  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower
hereby irrevocably authorizes Lender to make any and all withdrawals from the
Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account and transfers between any of the
Reserve Accounts as Lender shall determine inn Lender's sole and absolute
discretion and Lender may use all funds contained in any such accounts for any
purpose, including but not limited to repayment of the Debt in such order,
proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole and absolute
discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply funds as stated herein shall be
in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

     SECTION 10.3.  SECURITY INTEREST

     (a)  To secure the full and punctual payment of the Debt and performance of
all obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a first-priority
perfected security interest in the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account,
all interest, cash, checks, drafts, certificates and instruments, if any, from
time to time deposited or held therein, any and all amounts invested in
Permitted Investments, and all "proceeds" (as defined in the UCC as in effect in
the state in which the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account are located
or maintained) of any or all of the foregoing. Furthermore, Borrower shall not,
without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or
grant any security interest in any of the foregoing or permit any Lien to attach
thereto or any levy to be made thereon or any UCC Financing Statements to be
filed with respect thereto. Borrower will maintain the security interest created
by this Section 10.3(a) as a first priority perfected security interest and will
defend the right, title and interest of Lender in and to the Lockbox Account and
Cash Management Account against the claims and demands of all Persons
whomsoever.

     (b)  Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement or
statements required by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection
and priority of the security interest granted herein in connection with the
Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account. Borrower agrees that at any time
and from time to time, at the expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and
duly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all
further action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that Lender may
reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any security interest
granted or purported to be granted hereby (including, without limitation, any
security interest in and to any Permitted Investments) or to enable Lender to
exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder.


                                      -89-
<PAGE>


        (c)     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may exercise
any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured party, pledgee and lienholder
with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account. Without
limitation of the foregoing, upon any Event of Default, Lender may use the
Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account for any of the following purposes:
(A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited to, principal prepayments
and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial prepayment (as
applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses, fees, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) suffered or
incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment of any
amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to Lender
at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan
Documents; (D) payment of any item as required or permitted under this
Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted by applicable law; provided,
however, that any such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure
any Event of Default. Without limiting any other provisions hereof, each of the
remedial actions described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to be a commercially reasonable exercise of Lender's rights and remedies as a
secured party with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account
and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a foreclosure of
a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to
apply all or any portion of the Lockbox Account or Cash Management Account to
effect a cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any specific
order of priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's rights and remedies
under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents shall not in any
way prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate and complete a foreclosure
under the Mortgage.

        (d)     DEFINITIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, For purposes of this Article 10 only, Business Day shall mean a day on
which Lender and Lockbox Bank are both open for the conduct of substantially all
of their respective banking business at the office in the city in which the Note
is payable, with respect to Lender and at the office in the city where the
Lockbox Account is maintained, with respect to Lockbox Bank (in both instances,
excluding Saturdays and Sundays).

        (d)     Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 13.5 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 13.5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying
party may have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that
any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be
entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and,
to the extent that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party
to such indemnified party under this Section 13.5 the indemnifying party shall
be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one such separate counsel unless an
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to another indemnified party.

        (e)     In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 13.5(c)
or Section 13.5(d) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
indemniflable under Section 13.5(c) or Section 13.5(d), the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) the indemnified party's, Borrower's and Borrower Principal's relative
knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which
claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or
omission; and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the
circumstances. Lender, Borrower and Borrower Principal hereby agree that it
would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro
rata or per capita allocation.

        (f)     The liabilities and obligations of Borrower, Borrower Principal
and Lender under this Section 13.5 shall survive the satisfaction of this
Agreement and the satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

the performance of the Required Work, Additional Required Repairs or Additional
Replacements, or (g) the payment of any commission, charge or brokerage fee to
anyone which may be payable in connection with the funding of the Loan
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower
shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such
Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or
willful misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay
the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
Lender.

        SECTION 14.2. MORTGAGE AND INTANGIBLE TAX INDEMNIFICATION

        Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way
relating to any tax on the making and/or recording of the Mortgage, the Note or
any of the other Loan Documents, but excluding any income, franchise or other
similar taxes.

        Section 14.3. ERISA INDEMNIFICATION

        Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of Losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA that may be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur,
directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Section 4.8 or Section
5.18 of this Agreement.

        SECTION 14.4. SURVIVAL

        The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Article 14 shall
fully survive indefinitely notwithstanding any termination, satisfaction,
assignment, entry of a judgment of foreclosure, exercise of any power of sale,
or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Loan is paid off in full on the Maturity Date, Borrower
shall have no further liability under this Article 14 with respect to any event
that occurs subsequent to the Maturity Date.

                                   ARTICLE 15
                                   EXCULPATION

        SECTION 15.1. EXCULPATION

        (a)     Except as otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan
Documents, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or
Borrower Principal, as applicable, to perform and observe the obligations
contained herein or in the other Loan Documents by any action or proceeding
wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or Borrower Principal,
except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, action for specific
performance or other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to
enforce and realize upon this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents, and the interest in the Property, the Rents and any other
collateral given to Lender created by this Agreement, the Note the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that any judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower or Borrower
Principal, as applicable, only to the extent of Borrower's or Borrower
Principal's interest in the Property, in the Rents and in any other collateral
given to Lender. Lender, by accepting this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents, agrees that it shall not, except as otherwise provided
in this Section 15.1, sue for, seek or demand any deficiency judgment against
Borrower or Borrower Principal in any such action or proceeding, under or by
reason of or under or in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage
or the other Loan Documents. The provisions of this Section 15.1 shall not,
however, (i) constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation
evidenced or secured by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan
Documents; (ii) impair the right of Lender to name Borrower or Borrower
Principal as a party defendant in any action or suit for judicial foreclosure
and sale under this Agreement and the Mortgage; (iii) affect the validity or
enforceability of any indemnity (including, without limitation, the
Environmental Indemnity, Section 13.5 and Article 14 of this Agreement),
guaranty, master lease or similar instrument made in connection with this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents; (iv) impair the
right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a receiver; (v) impair the
enforcement of the assignment of leases provisions contained in the Mortgage; or
(vi) impair the right of Lender to obtain a deficiency judgment or other
judgment on the Note against Borrower or Borrower Principal if necessary to
obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to which Lender would otherwise be
entitled under this Agreement; provided however, Lender shall only enforce such
judgment to the extent of the Insurance Proceeds and/or Awards.


                                     -102-
<PAGE>


        (b)     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.1 to the
contrary, Borrower and Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to Lender
on a joint and several basis for Losses due to:

                (i)     fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower,
        Borrower Principal or any other Affiliate of Borrower or Borrower
        Principal in connection with the execution and the delivery of this
        Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage, any of the other Loan Documents, or
        any certificate, report, financial statement or other instrument or
        document furnished to Lender at the time of the closing of the Loan or
        during the term of the Loan;

                (ii)    Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of Rents
        received by Borrower after the occurrence of an Event of Default;

                (iii)   Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of tenant
        security deposits or Rents collected in advance;

                (iv)    the misapplication or the misappropriation of Insurance
        Proceeds or Awards;

                (v)     Borrower's failure to pay Taxes, Other Charges (except
        to the extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have been
        deposited in escrow with Lender pursuant to the terms hereof and there
        exists no impediment to Lender's utilization thereof), charges for labor
        or materials or other charges that can create liens on the Property
        beyond any applicable notice and cure periods specified herein;

                (vi)    Borrower's failure to return or to reimburse Lender for
        all Personal Property taken from the Property by or on behalf of
        Borrower and not replaced with Personal Property of the same utility and
        of the same or greater value;

                (vii)   any act of intentional waste or arson by Borrower, any
        principal, Affiliate, member or general partner thereof or by Borrower
        Principal, any principal, Affiliate, member or general partner thereof;

                (viii)  Borrower's failure following any Event of Default to
        deliver to Lender upon demand all Rents and books and records relating
        to the Property; or

                (ix)    Borrower's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

        (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to
pursue recourse liability against Borrower and Borrower Principal as set forth
in subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL AND VOID and shall be of no further
force and effect and the Debt shall be fully recourse to Borrower and Borrower
Principal jointly and severally in the event of (i) a default by Borrower,
Borrower Principal of any of the covenants set forth in Article 6, provided,
however, that a breach by Borrower of the covenants set forth in Article 6 shall
not result in recourse liability hereunder unless such breach was material and,
within fifteen (15) days of notice from Lender, Borrower fails to cure such
breach and fails to deliver to Lender a new or revised substantive
non-consolidation opinion, in form and substance and from counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Lender in accordance with the Rating Agency standards for the
same,


                                     -103-
<PAGE>


to the effect that such failure does not negate/impair the opinion previously
delivered to Lender, (ii) a default by Borrower, Borrower Principal or of any of
the covenants set forth in Article 7 hereof, or (iii) if (A) a voluntary
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by Borrower, or (B) an
involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced against Borrower
which is not dismissed within ninety (90) days of filing (provided, however,
that Borrower and Borrower Principal shall not have recourse liability hereunder
in connection with any involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding unless
such involuntary proceeding is solicited, procured, consented to or acquiesced
in by Borrower, any Affiliate of Borrower or Borrower Principal in bad faith
collusion with an intent to circumvent the prohibition on recourse liability
against the Borrower or Borrower Principal set forth herein).

        (d)     Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which
Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the indebtedness
secured by the Mortgage or to require that all collateral shall continue to
secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender in accordance with this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents.

        (e)     Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article 15 to the
contrary, in no event shall Borrower's failure to pay Operating Expenses in the
event cash flow is insufficient to pay such expenses be considered an act of
waste.

        (f)     Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in the event that of
a foreclosure under the pledge agreement(s) executed by Mezzanine Borrower in
connection with the Permitted Mezzanine Financing, and the subsequent transfer
of interests in Borrower to Mezzanine Lender, Borrower Principal shall be
released from its liabilities under this Article 15 with respect to any matters
arising from events occurring subsequent to the date of such transfer, as of the
effective date of such transfer of interests in Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE 16

                               FURTHER ASSURANCES

        SECTION 17.1. REPLACEMENT DOCUMENTS

        Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of Lender as to the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of the Note or any other Loan Document which is
not of public record: (i) with respect to any Loan Document other than the Note,
Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement of such other Loan Document,
dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Loan Document in the
same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor and (ii) with respect
to the Note, (a) Borrower will execute a reaffirmation of the Debt as evidenced
by such Note acknowledging that Lender has informed Borrower that the Note was
lost, stolen destroyed or mutilated and that such Debt continues to be an
obligation and liability of the Borrower as set forth in the Note, a copy of
which shall be attached to such reaffirmation and (b) if requested by Lender,
Borrower will execute a replacement note and Lender or Lender's custodian (at
Lender's option) shall provide to Borrower Lender's (or Lender's custodian's)
then standard form of lost note affidavit and indemnity, which such form shall
be reasonably acceptable to Borrower.

        SECTION 17.2. RECORDING OF MORTGAGE, ETC.

       Borrower forthwith upon the execution and delivery of the Mortgage and
thereafter, from time to time, will cause the Mortgage and any of the other Loan
Documents creating a lien or security interest or evidencing the lien hereof
upon the Property and each instrument of further assurance to be filed,
registered or recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by
any present or future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect and
perfect the lien or security interest hereof upon, and the interest of Lender
in, the Property. Borrower will pay all taxes, filing, registration or recording
fees, and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgment
and/or recording of the Note, the Mortgage, the other Loan Documents, any note,
deed of trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with
respect to the Property and any instrument of further assurance, and any
modification or amendment of the foregoing documents, and all federal, state,
county and municipal taxes, duties, imposts, assessments and charges arising out
of or in connection with the execution and delivery of the Mortgage, any deed of
trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with respect to
the Property or any instrument of further assurance, and any modification or
amendment of the foregoing documents, except where prohibited by law so to do.

        SECTION 17.3. FURTHER ACTS, ETC.

        Borrower will, at the cost of Borrower, and without expense to Lender,
do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every further acts, deeds,
conveyances, deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments, security agreements,
control agreements, notices of assignments, transfers and assurances as Lender
shall, from time to time, reasonably require, for the better assuring,
conveying, assigning, transferring, and confirming unto Lender the property and
rights hereby mortgaged, deeded, granted, bargained, sold, conveyed, confirmed,
pledged, assigned, warranted and transferred or intended now or hereafter so to
be, or which Borrower may be or


                                     -106-
<PAGE>


may hereafter become bound to convey or assign to Lender, or for carrying out
the intention or facilitating the performance of the terms of this Agreement or
for filing, registering or recording the Mortgage, or for complying with all
Legal Requirements. Borrower, on demand, will execute and deliver, and in the
event it shall fall to so execute and deliver, hereby authorizes Lender to
execute in the name of Borrower or without the signature of Borrower to the
extent Lender may lawfully do so, one or more financing statements and financing
statement amendments to evidence more effectively, perfect and maintain the
priority of the security interest of Lender in the Property. Borrower grants to
Lender an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose
of exercising and perfecting any and all rights and remedies available to Lender
at law and in equity, including without limitation, such rights and remedies
available to Lender pursuant to this Section 17.3.

        SECTION 17.4. CHANGES IN TAX, DEBT, CREDIT AND DOCUMENTARY STAMP LAWS

        (a)     If any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of
this Agreement which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on the Debt
or Lender's interest in the Property, Borrower will pay the tax, with interest
and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by counsel chosen by it that
the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or taxable to Lender or
unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury then Lender shall have
the option by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days to
declare the Debt immediately due and payable.

        (b)     Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit
or credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other Charges
assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction shall
otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of the Property, or any
part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by reason of the Mortgage or the
Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by law, Lender shall
have the option, by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120)
days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable.

        If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or any
subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to be
affixed to the Note, the Mortgage, or any of the other Loan Documents or impose
any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower will pay for the same, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any.

        SECTION 17.5. EXPENSES

        Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower falls to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable, actual attorneys' fees and
disbursements and the allocated costs of internal legal services and all actual
disbursements of internal counsel) reasonably incurred by Lender in accordance
with this Agreement in connection with (a) the underwriting and closing of the
Loan, including, without limitation, expenses related to Lender's legal
representation, underwriting, third party reports, travel and site inspections,
interest rate hedging and other customary items (except with respect to a
Securitization, any costs and expenses related to which that are payable by
Borrower shall be as set forth in Article 13 hereof) and all the costs of
furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without limitation
any opinions requested by Lender as to


                                     -107-
<PAGE>


any legal matters arising under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with
respect to the Property); (b) Borrower's ongoing performance of and compliance
with Borrower's respective agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after
the Closing Date, including, without limitation, confirming compliance with
environmental and insurance requirements; (c) following a request by Borrower,
Lender's ongoing performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be
performed or complied with after the Closing Date; (d) the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and administration of any consents, amendments,
waivers or other modifications to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and any other documents or matters requested by Lender; (e) securing Borrower's
compliance with any requests made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement;
(f) the filing and recording fees and expenses, title insurance and reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel for providing to Lender all required legal
opinions, and other similar expenses incurred in creating and perfecting the
Lien in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
(g) enforcing or preserving any rights, in response to third party claims or the
prosecuting or defending of any action or proceeding or other litigation, in
each case against, under or affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the Property, or any other security given for the Loan; and (h)
enforcing any obligations of or collecting any payments due from Borrower under
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to the Property or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable
for the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent the same arise by
reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of
Lender.

                                   ARTICLE 18
                                     WAIVERS

        SECTION 18.1. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS

        The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's
rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's
sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power
accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power
or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power
may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A
waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by
Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

        SECTION 18.2. MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING

        No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, or of the Note, or of any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in a


                                     -108-
<PAGE>


writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance, and for the
purpose, for which given. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no
notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall entitle Borrower to any other or future
notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.

        SECTION 18.3. DELAY NOT A WAIVER

        Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender in insisting
upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement, or
exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note or
under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due of all other
amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents, or to
declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

        SECTION 18.4. TRIAL BY JURY

        BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER

or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such agent, as
the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly, Borrower
agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any monetary
damages (except to the extent that Borrower can prove Lender's bad faith or
willful misconduct), and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing
an action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Lender
agrees that, in such event, it shall cooperate in expediting any action seeking
injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.

     SECTION 18.7. WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS

     To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Property, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the Debt without any

payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in preference to
every other claimant whatsoever.

     SECTION 18.8. WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

payment of the Debt or performance of its Other Obligations.

     Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

     SECTION 18.10. GRADSKY WAIVERS

     Borrower Principal hereby waives each of the following:

     (a)     Any rights of Borrower Principal of subrogation, reimbursement,

2787-2855, inclusive of the California Civil Code, or arising from the payment
by Borrower Principal of any reimbursement obligations with respect to the
Reserve Letter of Credit;

                                    - 110 -
<PAGE>
     (b)     Any rights or defenses that may be available by reason of any
election of remedies by Lender (including, without limitation, any such election
which in any manner impairs, effects, reduces, releases, destroys or
extinguishes Borrower Principal's subrogation rights, rights to proceed against
Borrower for reimbursement, or any other rights of Borrower Principal to proceed
against any other person, entity or security, including but not limited to any
defense based upon an election of remedies by Lender under the provisions of
Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any similar law of
California or of any other State or of the United Sates); and

     (c)     Any rights or defenses Borrower Principal may have because its
obligations under this Agreement (the "BORROWER PRINCIPAL OBLIGATIONS") are
secured by real property or any estate for years. These rights or defenses
include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses that are based upon,
directly or indirectly, the application of Section 580a, Section 580b, Section
580d or Section 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure to the Borrower
Principal Obligations.

     The provisions of this subsection (c) mean, among other things:

          (y)     Lender may collect from Borrower Principal without first
     foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Borrower
     for the Debt; and

          (z)     If Lender forecloses on a real property pledged by Borrower:

                  (A)     The Borrower Principal Obligations shall not be
          reduced by the price for which the collateral sold at the foreclosure
          sale or the value of the collateral at the time of the sale.

                  (B)     Lender may collect from Borrower Principal even if
          Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed
          any right of Borrower Principal to collect from Borrower. Further, the
          provisions of this Agreement constitute an unconditional and
          irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Borrower Principal may
          have because Borrower's obligations are secured by real property.
          These rights and defenses, include, but are not limited to, any rights
          or defenses based upon Section 580a, Section 580b, Section 580d or
          Section 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

                                    - 114 -

not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the party

Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors in entering into the
Loan without relying in any manner on any statements, representations or
recommendations of Lender or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender.
Lender shall not be subject to any limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any
rights or remedies available to it under any of the Loan Documents or any other
agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it

of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     SECTION 20.11. LIABILITY

     If Borrower consists of more than one Person, the obligations and
liabilities of each such Person hereunder shall be joint and several. This Loan
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower and Lender
and their respective successors and assigns forever.

     SECTION 20.12. CONTRIBUTIONS AND WAIVERS

     (a)     As a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each Borrower will benefit, directly and indirectly, from each Borrower's
obligation to pay the Debt and perform its Obligations (as defined in the
Mortgage) and in consideration therefore each Borrower desires to enter into an
allocation and contribution agreement among themselves as set forth in this
Section 20.12 to allocate such benefits among themselves and to provide a fair
and equitable agreement to make contributions among each of Borrowers in the
event any payment is made by any individual Borrower hereunder to Lender (such
payment being referred to herein as a "CONTRIBUTION," and for purposes of this
Section 20.12, includes any exercise of recourse by Lender against any
Collateral of a Borrower and application of proceeds of such Collateral in
satisfaction of such Borrower's obligations, to Lender under the Loan
Documents).

     (b)     Each Borrower shall be liable hereunder with respect to the
Obligations only for such total maximum amount (if any) that would not render
its Obligations hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents subject to
avoidance under Section 548 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provisions of any State law.

     (c)     In order to provide for a fair and equitable contribution among
Borrowers in the event that any Contribution is made by an individual Borrower
(a "FUNDING BORROWER"), such Funding Borrower shall be entitled to a
reimbursement Contribution ("REIMBURSEMENT

                                    - 115 -

<PAGE>
CONTRIBUTION") from all other Borrowers for all payments, damages and expenses
incurred by that Funding Borrower in discharging any of the Obligations, in the
manner and to the extent set forth in this Section 20.12.

     (d)     For purposes hereof, the "BENEFIT AMOUNT" of any individual
Borrower as of any date of determination shall be the net value of the benefits
to such Borrower and its Affiliates from extensions of credit made by Lender to
(i) such Borrower and (ii) to the other Borrowers hereunder and the Loan
Documents to the extent such other Borrowers have guaranteed or mortgaged their
properties to secure the Obligations of such Borrower to Lender.

     (e)     Each Borrower shall be liable to a Funding Borrower in an amount
equal to the greater of (i) the (A) ratio of the Benefit Amount of such Borrower
to the total amount of Obligations, multiplied by (B) the amount of Obligations
paid by such Funding Borrower, or (ii) ninety-five percent (95%) of the excess
of the fair saleable value of the property of such Borrower over the total
liabilities of such Borrower (including the maximum amount reasonably expected
to become due in respect of contingent liabilities) determined as of the date on
which the payment made by a Funding Borrower is deemed made for purposes hereof
(giving effect to all payments made by other Funding Borrowers as of such date
in a manner to maximize the amount of such Contributions).

     (f)     In the event that at any time there exists more than one Funding
Borrower with respect to any Contribution (in any such case, the "APPLICABLE
CONTRIBUTION"), then Reimbursement Contributions from other Borrowers pursuant
hereto shall be allocated among such Funding Borrowers in proportion to the
total amount of the Contribution made for or on account of the other Borrowers
by each such Funding Borrower pursuant to the Applicable Contribution. In the
event that at any time any Borrower pays an amount hereunder in excess of the
amount calculated pursuant to this Section 20.12 above, that Borrower shall be
deemed to be a Funding Borrower to the extent of such excess and shall be
entitled to a Reimbursement Contribution from the other Borrowers in accordance
with the provisions of this Section.

     (g)     Each Borrower acknowledges that the right to Reimbursement
Contribution hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of Borrower to which
such Reimbursement Contribution is owing.

     (h)     No Reimbursement Contribution payments payable by a Borrower
pursuant to the terms of this Section 20.12 shall be paid until all amounts then
due and payable by all of Borrowers to Lender, pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents, are paid in full in cash. Nothing contained in this Section 20.12
shall limit or affect in any way the Obligations of any Borrower to Lender under
this Note or any other Loan Documents.

     (i)     Each Borrower waives:

                  (A)     any right to require Lender to proceed against any
             other Borrower or any other person or to proceed against or exhaust
             any security held by Lender at any time or to pursue any other
             remedy in Lender's power before proceeding against Borrower;

                                    - 116 -

<PAGE>
     (B)     any defense based upon any legal disability or other defense of any
other Borrower, any guarantor of any other person or by reason of the cessation
or limitation of the liability of any other Borrower or any guarantor from any
cause other than full payment of all sums payable under the Note, this Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents;

     (C)     any defense based upon any lack of authority of the officers,
directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any other
Borrower or any principal of any other Borrower or any defect in the formation
of any other Borrower or any principal of any other Borrower;

     (D)     any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides
that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in any
other respects more burdensome than that of a principal;

     (E)     any defense based upon any failure by Lender to obtain collateral
for the indebtedness or failure by Lender to perfect a lien on any collateral;

     (F)     presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind;

     (G)     any defense based upon any failure of Lender to give notice of sale
or other disposition of any collateral to any other Borrower or to any other
person or entity or any defect in any notice that may be given in connection
with any sale or disposition of any collateral;

     (H)     any defense based upon any failure of Lender to comply with
Applicable Laws in connection with the sale or other disposition of any
collateral, including, without limitation, any failure of Lender to conduct a
commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of any collateral;

     (I)     any defense based upon any use of cash collateral under Section 363
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code;

     (J)     any defense based upon any agreement or stipulation entered into by
Lender with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy
proceeding;

     (K)     any defense based upon any borrowing or any grant of a security
interest under Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code;

     (L)     any defense based upon the avoidance of any security interest in
favor of Lender for any reason;

     (M)     any defense based upon any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution proceeding,
including any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any of the
obligations evidenced by the Note or owing under any of the Loan Documents; and

                                    - 117 -

<PAGE>
             (N)     any defense or benefit based upon Borrower's, or any other
        party's, resignation of the portion of any obligation secured by the
        applicable Security Instruments to be satisfied by any payment from any
        other Borrower or any such party.

(j)     Each Borrower waives:

             (A)     all rights and defenses arising out of an election of
        remedies by Lender even though the election of remedies, such as
        non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Loan or any
        other amounts owing under the Loan Documents, has destroyed Borrower's
        rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any other Borrower;

             (B)     all rights and defenses that Borrower may have because any
        of Debt is secured by real property. This means, among other things: (i)
        Lender may collect from Borrower without first foreclosing on any real
        or personal property collateral pledged by any other Borrower, (ii) if
        Lender forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by any other
        Borrower, (a) the amount of the Debt may be reduced only by the price
        for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the
        collateral is worth more than the sale price, (b) Lender may collect
        from Borrower even if any other Borrower, by foreclosing on the real
        property collateral, has destroyed any right Borrower may have to
        collect from any other Borrower. This is an unconditional and
        irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Borrower may have because
        any of the Debt is secured by real property; and

             (C)     except as may be expressly and specifically permitted
        herein, any claim or other right which Borrower might now have or
        hereafter acquire against any other Borrower or any other person that
        arises from the existence or performance of any obligations under the
        Note, this Agreement, the Security Instruments or the other Loan
        Documents, including, without limitation, any of the following: (i) any
        right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or
        indemnification; or (ii) any right to participate in any claim or remedy
        of Lender against any other Borrower or any collateral security
        therefor, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or
        under contract, statute or common law.
