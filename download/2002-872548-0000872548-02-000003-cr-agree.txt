2. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

     2.1.  COMMITMENT TO LEND.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this  Credit  Agreement,  each of the  Lenders  severally  agrees to lend to the
Borrowers  and the  Borrowers  may borrow,  repay,  and  reborrow on a joint and
several  basis from time to time from the Closing  Date up to but not  including
the  Revolving  Credit  Maturity  Date  upon  notice  by  the  Borrowers  to the
Administrative Agent given in accordance with ss.2.6, such sums as are requested
by the  Borrowers up to a maximum  aggregate  amount  outstanding  (after giving
effect  to all  amounts  requested)  at any one  time  equal  to  such  Lender's
Revolving  Credit  Commitment MINUS such Lender's  Revolving  Credit  Commitment
Percentage of the sum of the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations  which have not been repaid with the  proceeds of  Revolving  Credit
Loans,  PROVIDED that the sum of the outstanding  amount of the Revolving Credit
Loans (after giving effect to all amounts  requested)  PLUS the Maximum  Drawing
Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement  Obligations which have not been repaid with
the proceeds of Revolving  Credit Loans,  shall not at any time exceed the Total
Revolving  Commitment at such time. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be made PRO
RATA in accordance with each Lender's  Revolving Credit  Commitment  Percentage.
Each  request  for  a  Revolving   Credit  Loan  hereunder  shall  constitute  a
representation  and warranty by the Borrowers  that the  conditions set forth in
ss.12 and ss.13, in the case of the initial Revolving Credit Loans to be made on
the Closing Date, and ss.13,  in the case of all other  Revolving  Credit Loans,
have  been  satisfied  on the  date of such  request.  Notwithstanding  anything
contained herein to the contrary,  (a) for the period  commencing on the Closing
Date  through  the date  that is seven  (7) days  from  the  Closing  Date,  the
aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Loans  outstanding plus the Maximum Drawing
Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations as of the Closing Date shall not
exceed  $9,000,000  and (b) for the period  commencing on the date that is seven
(7) days from the Closing  Date  through the date that is ten (10) days from the
Closing Date, the aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Loans  outstanding  shall
not exceed $6,000,000.

     2.2.  COMMITMENT  FEE. The Borrowers  jointly and severally agree to pay to
the  Administrative  Agent for the  accounts of the Lenders in  accordance  with

                                      -26-

their respective  Revolving Credit Commitment  Percentages a commitment fee (the
"COMMITMENT  FEE")  calculated at the rate of one-half of one percent (1/2%) per
annum on the  average  daily  amount  during  each  calendar  quarter or portion
thereof from the Closing Date to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date by which the
Total Revolving  Commitment  MINUS the sum of the Maximum Drawing Amount and all
Unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligations  exceeds the outstanding  amount of Revolving
Credit Loans during such calendar  quarter.  The Commitment Fee shall be payable
quarterly  in  arrears  on the  first  day of  each  calendar  quarter  for  the
immediately  preceding  calendar  quarter  commencing  on the  first  such  date

     2.3. REDUCTION OF TOTAL REVOLVING COMMITMENT.  The Borrowers shall have the
right at any time  and from  time to time  upon  five (5)  Business  Days  prior
written notice to the Administrative  Agent to reduce by an integral multiple of

the  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  of the Lenders shall be reduced PRO RATA in
accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitment  Percentages of the
amount  specified  in such notice or, as the case may be,  terminated.  Promptly
after receiving any notice of the Borrowers  delivered  pursuant to this ss.2.3,
the Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of the substance thereof.  Upon
the effective date of any such reduction or termination, the Borrowers shall pay
to the Administrative  Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders the full
amount of any  Commitment  Fee then accrued on the amount of the  reduction.  No
reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit  Commitments may be reinstated.
In addition,  the Total Revolving Commitment shall be reduced in accordance with
ss.4.4.2.4.

     2.4.  THE  REVOLVING  CREDIT  NOTES.  The  Revolving  Credit Loans shall be
evidenced by separate  promissory  notes of the Borrowers in  substantially  the
form of  EXHIBIT A hereto  (each a  "REVOLVING  CREDIT  NOTE"),  dated as of the
Closing  Date (or such other date on which a Lender may become a party hereto in
accordance  with ss.16 hereof) and completed with  appropriate  insertions.  One
Revolving  Credit  Note  shall  be  payable  to the  order of each  Lender  in a
principal amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment or, if less,
the outstanding  amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such Lender,  plus
interest accrued thereon, as set forth below. Each of the Borrowers  irrevocably
authorizes  each Lender to make or cause to be made, at or about the time of the
Drawdown  Date of any  Revolving  Credit  Loan or at the time of  receipt of any
payment of principal on such  Lender's  Revolving  Credit Note,  an  appropriate
notation on such Lender's  Revolving Credit Note Record reflecting the making of
such Revolving  Credit Loan or (as the case may be) the receipt of such payment.
The outstanding  amount of the Revolving Credit Loans set forth on such Lender's
Revolving  Credit Note Record  shall be PRIMA  FACIE  evidence of the  principal
amount  thereof owing and unpaid to such Lender,  but the failure to record,  or
any error in so  recording,  any such amount on such Lender's  Revolving  Credit
Note Record shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrowers

                                      -27-

hereunder or under any Revolving Credit Note to make payments of principal of or
interest on any Revolving Credit Note when due.

     2.5. INTEREST ON REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

     Except as otherwise provided in ss.6.10,

                  (a) Each Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan shall
         bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof
         and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto
         at the rate per annum equal to the Base Rate PLUS the Applicable Margin
         with respect to Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

                  (b) Each Revolving Credit Loan which is a Eurodollar Rate Loan
         shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date
         thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect
         thereto at the rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined
         for such Interest Period PLUS the Applicable Margin with respect to
         Eurodollar Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

The Borrowers  jointly and severally  promise to pay interest on each  Revolving
Credit Loan in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect thereto.

     2.6.  REQUESTS FOR REVOLVING  CREDIT LOANS. The Borrowers shall give to the
Administrative  Agent  written  notice  in the  form of  EXHIBIT  B  hereto  (or
telephonic  notice  confirmed  in a writing  in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto) of
each Revolving  Credit Loan requested  hereunder (a "LOAN REQUEST") no less than
(a) one (1) Business Day prior to the  proposed  Drawdown  Date of any Base Rate
Loan and (b) three (3) Eurodollar  Business Days prior to the proposed  Drawdown
Date of any  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan.  Each such  notice  shall  specify  (i) the
principal  amount of the  Revolving  Credit Loan  requested,  (ii) the  proposed
Drawdown Date of such Revolving  Credit Loan, (iii) the Interest Period for such
Revolving Credit Loan and (iv) the Type of such Revolving Credit Loan.  Promptly
upon receipt of any such notice, the  Administrative  Agent shall notify each of
the Lenders  thereof.  Each Loan Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrowers and shall  obligate the Borrowers to accept the Revolving  Credit Loan
requested  from the Lenders on the  proposed  Drawdown  Date.  Each Loan Request
shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $500,000 or an integral of $100,000 in
excess thereof.

     2.7. CONVERSION OPTIONS.

          2.7.1.  CONVERSION  TO DIFFERENT  TYPE OF REVOLVING  CREDIT LOAN.  The
     Borrowers may elect from time to time to convert any outstanding  Revolving
     Credit Loan to a Revolving  Credit Loan of another Type,  PROVIDED that (a)
     with respect to any such  conversion  of a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan to a Base
     Rate Loan, the Borrowers shall give the  Administrative  Agent at least one
     (1) Business Day prior written notice of such election; (b) with respect to
     any such  conversion  of a Base Rate Loan to a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan,  the
     Borrowers shall give the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Eurodollar

                                      -28-

     Business Days prior written  notice of such  election;  (c) with respect to
     any such  conversion of a Eurodollar  Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan, such
     conversion  shall only be made on the last day of the Interest  Period with
     respect  thereto;  and (d) no Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a
     Eurodollar  Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and
     is  continuing.  On the date on which  such  conversion  is being made each
     Lender shall take such action as is  necessary  to transfer  its  Revolving
     Credit Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans to its Domestic
     Lending Office or its Eurodollar Lending Office, as the case may be. All or
     any part of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of any Type may be converted
     into a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type as provided  herein,  PROVIDED
     that any partial  conversion  shall be in an aggregate  principal amount of
     $500,000 or an integral of  $100,000  in excess  thereof.  Each  Conversion
     Request  relating  to  the  conversion  of a  Revolving  Credit  Loan  to a
     Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be irrevocable by the Borrowers.

          2.7.2.  CONTINUATION  OF TYPE OF REVOLVING  CREDIT LOAN. Any Revolving
     Credit Loan of any Type may be continued as a Revolving  Credit Loan of the
     same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by
     compliance  by the  Borrowers  with  the  notice  provisions  contained  in
     ss.2.7.1;  PROVIDED that no  Eurodollar  Rate Loan may be continued as such
     when any Default or Event of Default has  occurred and is  continuing,  but
     shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the
     first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any
     Default or Event of Default of which officers of the  Administrative  Agent
     active upon the Borrowers' account have actual knowledge. In the event that
     the  Borrowers  fail  to  provide  any  such  notice  with  respect  to the
     continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan as such, then such Eurodollar Rate
     Loan shall be  automatically  converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day
     of the first Interest Period relating  thereto.  The  Administrative  Agent
     shall  notify  the  Lenders  promptly  when any such  automatic  conversion
     contemplated by this ss.2.7 is scheduled to occur.

          2.7.3 . EURODOLLAR  RATE LOANS.  Any conversion to or from  Eurodollar
     Rate Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such  elections
     so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all
     Eurodollar  Rate Loans  having the same  Interest  Period shall not be less
     than $500,000 or a whole  multiple of $100,000 in excess  thereof.  No more
     than six (6) Eurodollar Rate Loans having different Interest Periods may be
     outstanding at any time.

     2.8. FUNDS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN.

          2.8.1. FUNDING PROCEDURES.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. (Boston time) on
     the proposed  Drawdown  Date of any  Revolving  Credit  Loans,  each of the
     Lenders  will  make  available  to  the   Administrative   Agent,   at  the

                                      -29-

     Administrative  Agent's Office, in immediately  available funds, the amount
     of such Lender's  Revolving Credit  Commitment  Percentage of the amount of
     the requested Revolving Credit Loans. Upon receipt from each Lender of such
     amount,  and upon receipt of the documents  required by ss.ss.12 and 13 and
     the satisfaction of the other  conditions set forth therein,  to the extent
     applicable,  the Administrative  Agent will make available to the Borrowers
     the aggregate  amount of such Revolving  Credit Loans made available to the
     Administrative  Agent by the Lenders.  The failure or refusal of any Lender
     to make  available to the  Administrative  Agent at the aforesaid  time and
     place on any Drawdown  Date the amount of its Revolving  Credit  Commitment
     Percentage  of the requested  Revolving  Credit Loans shall not relieve any
     other Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make available to the
     Administrative  Agent the amount of such other  Lender's  Revolving  Credit
     Commitment Percentage of any requested Revolving Credit Loans.

          2.8.2. ADVANCES BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may,
     unless  notified to the  contrary by any Lender  prior to a Drawdown  Date,
     assume that such Lender has made available to the  Administrative  Agent on
     such Drawdown Date the amount of such Lender's  Revolving Credit Commitment
     Percentage of the Revolving  Credit Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date,
     and the  Administrative  Agent may (but it shall not be  required  to),  in
     reliance  upon  such   assumption,   make  available  to  the  Borrowers  a
     corresponding  amount. If any Lender makes available to the  Administrative
     Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Lender shall pay
     to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (a)
     the average computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of the
     weighted average interest rate paid by the Administrative Agent for federal
     funds acquired by the Administrative Agent during each day included in such
     period,  TIMES (b) the amount of such Lender's  Revolving Credit Commitment
     Percentage  of such  Revolving  Credit  Loans,  TIMES (c) a  fraction,  the
     numerator  of which is the number of days that  elapse  from and  including
     such  Drawdown  Date to the  date on  which  the  amount  of such  Lender's
     Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans shall
     become  immediately   available  to  the  Administrative   Agent,  and  the
     denominator  of which  is 360.  A  statement  of the  Administrative  Agent
     submitted  to such  Lender  with  respect to any  amounts  owing under this
     paragraph  shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the amount due and owing to the
     Administrative  Agent  by such  Lender.  If the  amount  of  such  Lender's
     Revolving  Credit  Commitment  Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans is
     not made available to the Administrative  Agent by such Lender within three
     (3) Business Days following such Drawdown  Date, the  Administrative  Agent

payable on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, all of the Revolving Credit Loans
outstanding on such date,  together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon.

     3.2. MANDATORY REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. If at any time the sum
of the  outstanding  amount of the Revolving  Credit Loans,  the Maximum Drawing
Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement  Obligations which have not been repaid with

at such time, then the Borrowers shall immediately pay the amount of such excess

repaid with the proceeds of Revolving  Credit  Loans;  second,  to the Revolving
Credit Loans; and third, to provide to the Administrative  Agent cash collateral
for Reimbursement Obligations as contemplated by ss.5.2(b) and (c). Each payment
of any Unpaid Reimbursement  Obligations or prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans
shall be allocated among the Lenders,  in proportion,  as nearly as practicable,
to each  Reimbursement  Obligation or (as the case may be) the respective unpaid
principal amount of each Lender's Revolving Credit Note, with adjustments to the
extent  practicable  to equalize any prior payments or repayments not exactly in
proportion. In addition, the Borrowers shall repay the Revolving Credit Loans in

premium,  PROVIDED that any full or partial prepayment of the outstanding amount
of any  Eurodollar  Rate Loans  pursuant  to this ss.3.3 may be made only on the
last day of the Interest Period relating  thereto.  The Borrowers shall give the
Administrative  Agent,  no later than 10:00 a.m.,  Boston time, at least one (1)
Business Day prior written  notice of any proposed  prepayment  pursuant to this
ss.3.3 of Base Rate Loans, and three (3) Eurodollar  Business Days notice of any
proposed  prepayment  pursuant to this ss.3.3 of Eurodollar  Rate Loans, in each
case  specifying  the proposed date of prepayment of Revolving  Credit Loans and
the  principal  amount  to be  prepaid.  Each  such  partial  prepayment  of the
Revolving  Credit Loans shall be in an integral  multiple of $100,000,  shall be
accompanied by the payment of accrued  interest on the principal  prepaid to the
date of prepayment  and shall be applied,  in the absence of  instruction by the
Borrowers,  first to the  principal of Base Rate Loans and then to the principal
of Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Each partial  prepayment shall be allocated among the
Lenders,  in proportion,  as nearly as  practicable,  to the  respective  unpaid
principal amount of each Lender's Revolving Credit Note, with adjustments to the
extent practicable to equalize any prior repayments not exactly in proportion.

     collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations, and

          (c) upon the  termination of the Total  Revolving  Commitment,  or the

     Drawing Amount on all Letters of Credit,  which amount shall be held by the
     Administrative  Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative
     Agent as cash collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations.

Each  such  payment   shall  be  made  to  the   Administrative   Agent  at  the
Administrative   Agent's  Office  in  immediately  available  funds.  Except  as
otherwise  provided in ss.5.3 with respect to Unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligations
which are converted tO Revolving  Credit Loans,  interest on any and all amounts
remaining  unpaid by the  Borrowers  under this ss.5.2 at any time froM the date
such  amounts  become due and  payable  (whether  as stated in this  ss.5.2,  by
acceleration  or  otherwise)  until  paymenT  in full  (whether  before or after
judgment)  shall be  payable to the  Administrative  Agent on demand at the rate
specified in ss.6.10 for overdue principal on the Revolving Credit Loans.

     5.3.  LETTER OF CREDIT  PAYMENTS.  If any draft shall be presented or other
demand for payment shall be made under any Letter of Credit,  the Administrative
Agent shall notify the  Borrowers of the date and amount of the draft  presented
or demand for payment and of the date and time when it expects to pay such draft
or honor  such  demand for  payment.  If the  Borrowers  fail to  reimburse  the
Administrative Agent as provided in ss.5.2 on or before the date that such draft
is paid oR other payment is made by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent shall at any time thereafter  notify the Lenders of the amount of any such
Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation. If no Event of Default is then continuing,  the
Borrower shall be deemed to have  requested a Revolving  Credit Loan which shall
be a Base  Rate  Loan in an amount  equal to the  amount of such  draft or other

                                      -41-

payment and the notice  from the  Administrative  Agent to the Lenders  shall be
deemed to be a notice of Loan Request made by the Administrative Agent. No later
than 3:00 p.m.  (Boston time) on the Business Day next  following the receipt of
such notice,  each Lender shall make available to the  Administrative  Agent, at
the Administrative Agent's Office, in immediately available funds, such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid Reimbursement  Obligation,
together  with an amount equal to the product of (a) the  average,  computed for
the period  referred to in clause (c) below,  of the weighted  average  interest
rate  paid  by the  Administrative  Agent  for  federal  funds  acquired  by the
Administrative  Agent  during each day  included in such  period,  TIMES (b) the
amount equal to such Lender's  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  Percentage of such
Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, TIMES (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days that elapse from and  including  the date the  Administrative
Agent paid the draft  presented for honor or otherwise  made payment to the date
on which such Lender's  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  Percentage of such Unpaid
Reimbursement   Obligation   shall   become   immediately   available   to   the
Administrative  Agent,  and the  denominator  of  which  is 360.  If no Event of
Default is continuing at the time the Administrative  Agent notified the Lenders
of the  amount  of  such  Unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligation,  the  amounts  made
available to the Administrative  Agent by the Lenders hereunder shall be treated
as Revolving  Credit Loans in all respects  which bear interest at the Base Rate
with a Drawdown Date as of the date on which the  Administrative  Agent paid the
draft presented for honor or otherwise made such payment. If an Event of Default
is  continuing  at the time of such  notice,  the  amount of such draft or other
payment made by the Administrative  Agent in respect of the applicable Letter of
Credit shall be treated in all respects as an Unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligation.
The responsibility of the Administrative  Agent to the Borrowers and the Lenders
shall be only to determine that the documents  (including each draft)  delivered
under each  Letter of Credit in  connection  with such  presentment  shall be in
conformity in all material respects with such Letter of Credit.

may have or have  had  against  the  Administrative  Agent,  any  Lender  or any
beneficiary  of a Letter  of  Credit.  Each  Borrower  further  agrees  with the
Administrative  Agent  and the  Lenders  that the  Administrative  Agent and the
Lenders  shall  not  be  responsible  for,  and  the  Borrowers'   Reimbursement
Obligations  under  ss.5.2 shall not be affected  by,  among other  things,  the
validity or genuinenesS  of documents or of any  endorsements  thereon,  even if
such  documents  should  in fact  prove  to be in any or all  respects  invalid,
fraudulent  or  forged,  or any  dispute  between  or among  any  Borrower,  the
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any financing  institution or other party
to which any  Letter of Credit  may be  transferred  or any  claims or  defenses
whatsoever of any Borrower  against the  beneficiary  of any Letter of Credit or

                                      -42-

any such  transferee.  The  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders  shall not be
liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,  dispatch

of Credit and the related drafts and documents,  if done in good faith, shall be
binding upon the  Borrowers and shall not result in any liability on the part of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the Borrowers.

certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message,  statement,  order or other  document  believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been  signed,  sent or made by the proper  Person or Persons
and upon advice and statements of legal  counsel,  independent  accountants  and
other experts selected by the  Administrative  Agent. The  Administrative  Agent
shall be fully  justified  in failing or refusing to take any action  under this
Credit  Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence
of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems  appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its reasonable  satisfaction  by the Lenders  against any and all
liability  and  expense  which  may be  incurred  by it by  reason  of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Administrative  Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting,  or in refraining  from acting,  under this Credit
Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request
and any action  taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto  shall be binding upon
the Lenders and all future holders of the Revolving  Credit Notes or of a Letter
of Credit Participation.

     5.6.  LETTER OF CREDIT FEE.  With  respect to each Letter of Credit  issued
hereunder,  the  Borrowers  shall  pay to the  Administrative  Agent a fee  (the
"LETTER  OF CREDIT  FEE") for each  Letter of Credit  issued or  renewed  by the
Administrative  Agent at a rate per annum  equal to the  Applicable  Margin with
respect to Letters of Credit in effect from time to time, on the Maximum Drawing
Amount  of such  Letter  of  Credit  for the  period  such  Letter  of Credit is
outstanding.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall,  in turn,  remit to each Lender
(including Fleet) such Lender's  Revolving Credit  Commitment  Percentage of the
Letter of Credit Fee. In addition,  the  Borrowers  will pay the  Administrative
Agent,  for its own  account,  a  Fronting  Fee (the  "FRONTING  FEE")  equal to
one-quarter  of one percent  (0.25%) per annum on the Maximum  Drawing Amount of
such Letter of Credit for the period such Letter of Credit is  outstanding.  The
Letter of Credit Fee and the Fronting Fee shall be payable  quarterly in arrears
on the last day of each calendar  quarter for the calendar  quarter then ending.
In  respect  of each  Letter of  Credit,  the  Borrowers  shall  also pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, at such time or times as such charges
are customarily made by the  Administrative  Agent, the  Administrative  Agent's
customary  issuance,  amendment,  negotiation or document  examination and other
administrative fees as in effect from time to time.

     6.1.  FEES.  The  Borrowers  jointly  and  severally  agree  to  pay to the
Administrative Agent all fees described in the Fee Letter in accordance with the
terms thereof.

     6.2. FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

          6.2.1 . PAYMENTS TO  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT. All payments of principal,
     interest,  Reimbursement  Obligations,  Fees  and  any  other  amounts  due
     hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made on the due
     date thereof to the  Administrative  Agent in Dollars,  for the  respective
     accounts of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative
     Agent's  Office or at such other  place that the  Administrative  Agent may
     from time to time designate,  in each case at or about 11:00 a.m.  (Boston,
     Massachusetts,  time or other  local time at the place of  payment)  and in
     immediately available funds.

          6.2.2.  NO OFFSET,  ETC. All payments by the  Borrowers  hereunder and
     under any of the other Loan  Documents  shall be made  without  recoupment,
     setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without  deduction for any
     taxes, levies, imposts,  duties,  charges, fees, deductions,  withholdings,
     compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter
     imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political  subdivision thereof
     or taxing or other authority  therein unless the Borrowers are compelled by
     law to make  such  deduction  or  withholding.  If any such  obligation  is
     imposed  upon the  Borrowers  with  respect  to any  amount  payable  by it
     hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents,  the Borrowers will pay
     to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders or (as the case
     may be) the  Administrative  Agent, on the date on which such amount is due
     and payable  hereunder or under such other Loan Document,  such  additional
     amount in  Dollars  as shall be  necessary  to enable  the  Lenders  or the
     Administrative  Agent to receive  the same net amount  which the Lenders or
     the  Administrative  Agent would have received on such due date had no such
     obligation  been imposed upon the  Borrowers.  The  Borrowers  will deliver
     promptly to the  Administrative  Agent certificates or other valid vouchers
     for all  taxes or other  charges  deducted  from or paid  with  respect  to
     payments made by the Borrowers hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

     6.3.  COMPUTATIONS.  All  computations of interest on the Loans and of Fees
shall be based on a 360-day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed.
Except as otherwise  provided in the  definition of the term  "INTEREST  PERIOD"
with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, whenever a payment hereunder or under any
of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the
due date for such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
and interest shall accrue during such extension.  The outstanding  amount of the
Loans as  reflected  on the  Revolving  Credit  Note  Records  and the Term Note

                                      -44-

Records  from  time to time  shall be  considered  correct  and  binding  on the
Borrowers  unless  within five (5) Business  Days after receipt of any notice by
the Administrative  Agent or any of the Lenders of such outstanding  amount, the
Administrative Agent or such Lender shall notify the Borrowers to the contrary.

     6.4.  INABILITY TO DETERMINE  EURODOLLAR  RATE. In the event,  prior to the
commencement  of any Interest  Period  relating to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
Administrative Agent shall determine or be notified by the Required Lenders that
(a) adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar
Rate that would otherwise determine the rate of interest to be applicable to any
Eurodollar  Rate Loan  during any  Interest  Period or (b) the  Eurodollar  Rate
determined or to be determined for such Interest  Period will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining their Eurodollar
Rate Loans during such period,  the  Administrative  Agent shall  forthwith give
notice of such  determination  (which  shall be  conclusive  and  binding on the
Borrowers and the Lenders) to the  Borrowers and the Lenders.  In such event (i)
any Loan Request or  Conversion  Request with respect to  Eurodollar  Rate Loans
shall be  automatically  withdrawn  and shall be deemed a request  for Base Rate
Loans, (ii) each Eurodollar Rate Loan will automatically, on the last day of the
then current  Interest  Period  relating  thereto,  become a Base Rate Loan, and
(iii) the  obligations  of the  Lenders to make  Eurodollar  Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Administrative  Agent or the Required Lenders determine that
the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist,  whereupon the
Administrative  Agent or, as the case may be, the Administrative  Agent upon the
instruction  of the  Required  Lenders,  shall so notify the  Borrowers  and the
Lenders.

     6.5.  ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  herein,  if any
present or future law, regulation,  treaty or directive or in the interpretation
or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar  Rate  Loans,  such  Lender  shall  forthwith  give  notice  of  such
circumstances  to the  Borrowers  and the other  Lenders and  thereupon  (a) the
commitment  of such Lender to make  Eurodollar  Rate Loans or convert  Base Rate
Loans to  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans  shall  forthwith  be  suspended  and (b) such
Lender's  Loans then  outstanding  as Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  if any,  shall be
converted  automatically  to Base  Rate  Loans on the last day of each  Interest
Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or within such earlier period as
may be  required  by  law.  Each  Borrower  hereby  agrees  promptly  to pay the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, upon demand by such Lender,
any  additional  amounts  necessary  to  compensate  such  Lender  for any costs
incurred by such Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this ss.6.5,
including  any  interest  or fees  payable  by such  Lender to  lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder.

     6.6.  ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If any present or future applicable law, which
expression,  as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations thereunder
and  interpretations  thereof by any competent  court or by any  governmental or
other  regulatory  body or  official  charged  with  the  administration  or the

                                      -45-

interpretation thereof and requests, directives, instructions and notices at any
time or from time to time hereafter made upon or otherwise  issued to any Lender
or the  Administrative  Agent by any central bank or other  fiscal,  monetary or
other authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall:

          (a) subject any Lender or the  Administrative  Agent to any tax, levy,
     impost,  duty,  charge,  fee,  deduction or  withholding of any nature with
     respect to this Credit Agreement,  the other Loan Documents, any Letters of
     Credit,  such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment or the Loans (other than
     taxes based upon or measured by the income or profits of such Lender or the
     Administrative Agent), or

          (b)  materially  change the basis of  taxation  (except for changes in
     taxes on income or profits) of payments to any Lender of the  principal  of
     or the interest on any Loans or any other amounts  payable to any Lender or
     the  Administrative  Agent under this Credit  Agreement or any of the other
     Loan Documents, or

          (c) impose or increase or render  applicable (other than to the extent
     specifically  provided for elsewhere in this Credit  Agreement) any special
     deposit, reserve, assessment,  liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar
     requirements  (whether or not having the force of law) against  assets held
     by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by, or letters of credit
     issued by, or commitments of an office of any Lender, or

          (d)  impose  on any  Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent  any  other
     conditions or requirements with respect to this Credit Agreement, the other
     Loan Documents,  any Letters of Credit,  the Loans, such Lender's Revolving
     Credit Commitment,  or any class of loans, letters of credit or commitments
     of which  any of the Loans or such  Lender's  Revolving  Credit  Commitment
     forms a part, and the result of any of the foregoing is

               (i) to  increase  the  cost to any  Lender  of  making,  funding,
          issuing,  renewing,  extending or maintaining any of the Loans or such
          Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment or any Letter of Credit, or

               (ii) to reduce the amount of principal,  interest,  Reimbursement
          Obligation   or  other   amount   payable   to  such   Lender  or  the
          Administrative  Agent hereunder on account of such Lender's  Revolving
          Credit Commitment, any Letter of Credit or any of the Loans, or

               (iii) to require such Lender or the Administrative  Agent to make
          any payment or to forego any interest or  Reimbursement  Obligation or
          other sum payable  hereunder,  the amount of which payment or foregone

                                      -46-

          interest or  Reimbursement  Obligation  or other sum is  calculated by
          reference to the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received
          by  such  Lender  or  the  Administrative  Agent  from  the  Borrowers
          hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrowers will, upon demand made by such Lender
or (as the case may be) the  Administrative  Agent at any time and from  time to
time and as often as the occasion  therefor may arise, pay to such Lender or the
Administrative Agent such additional amounts as will be sufficient to compensate
such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent for such additional  cost,  reduction,
payment or foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum.

     6.7.CAPITAL   ADEQUACY.  If  after  the  date  hereof  any  Lender  or  the
Administrative  Agent  determines that (a) the adoption of or change in any law,
governmental rule,  regulation,  policy,  guideline or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) regarding  capital  requirements  for Lenders or Lender
holding companies or any change in the interpretation or application  thereof by
a Governmental  Authority with  appropriate  jurisdiction,  or (b) compliance by
such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent or any  corporation  controlling  such
Lender or the Administrative Agent with any law, governmental rule,  regulation,
policy,  guideline or directive  (whether or not having the force of law) of any
such entity regarding capital adequacy, has the effect of reducing the return on
such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's commitment with respect to any Loans
to a level below that which such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent could have
achieved but for such adoption,  change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's or the Administrative  Agent's then existing policies with respect
to capital adequacy and assuming full  utilization of such entity's  capital) by
any  amount  deemed by such  Lender  or (as the case may be) the  Administrative
Agent to be material,  then such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent may notify
the Borrowers of such fact.  To the extent that the amount of such  reduction in
the return on capital is not reflected in the Base Rate, the Borrowers  agree to
pay such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative  Agent for the amount
of such  reduction  in the  return  on  capital  as and when such  reduction  is
determined  upon  presentation  by  such  Lender  or (as  the  case  may be) the
Administrative  Agent of a certificate in accordance  with ss.6.8  hereof.  Each
LendeR shall allocate such cost increases  among its customers in good faith and
on an equitable basis.

     6.8.  CERTIFICATE.  A  certificate  setting  forth any  additional  amounts
payable  pursuant to  ss.ss.6.6 or 6.7 and a brIef  explanation  of such amounts
which  are due,  submitted  by any  Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent to the
Borrowers, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due
and owing.

     6.9. INDEMNITY. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to indemnify each
Lender and to hold each  Lender  harmless  from and  against  any loss,  cost or
expense (including loss of anticipated  profits) that such Lender may sustain or
incur as a  consequence  of (a)  default  by the  Borrowers  in  payment  of the
principal amount of or any interest on any Eurodollar Rate Loans as and when due

                                      -47-

and payable,  including  any such loss or expense  arising from interest or fees
payable by such Lender to banks of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its
Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  (b) default by the  Borrowers  in making a borrowing or
conversion  after the Borrowers  have given (or are deemed to have given) a Loan
Request, notice (in the case of all or any portion of the Term Loans pursuant to
ss.4.5.3) or a Conversion  Request relating thereto iN accordance with ss.2.6 or
ss.2.7 or ss.4.5 or (c) the making of any payment of a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan or
the making oF any  conversion of any such Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that
is not the last day of the  applicable  Interest  Period with  respect  thereto,
including  interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds  obtained
by it in order to maintain any such Loans.

     6.10. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.

          6.10.1  .  OVERDUE  AMOUNTS.  Overdue  principal  and (to  the  extent
     permitted by  applicable  law)  interest on the Loans and all other overdue
     amounts  payable  hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents  shall
     bear interest  compounded monthly and payable on demand at a rate per annum
     equal to (a) in the case of any  Revolving  Credit Loans or Term Loan A the
     Base Rate PLUS the  Applicable  Margin  for Base Rate  Loans then in effect
     PLUS three  percent  (3%) per annum and (b) in the case of Term Loan B, the
     Base Rate PLUS two and one-half  percent (2.5%) plus three percent (3%) per
     annum,  in each case until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well
     as before judgment).

          6.10.2 . AMOUNTS NOT OVERDUE.  During the  continuance  of an Event of
     Default the principal of the Loans not overdue  shall,  until such Event of
     Default has been cured, remedied or waived by the Required Lenders pursuant
     to  ss.17.12,  bear  interest  at a rate  per  annum  equal  to the rate of
     interest applicable to overdue principal pursuant to ss.6.10.1.

     6.11. CONCERNING JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF THE BORROWERS.

               (a)  Each  of  the  Borrowers  is  accepting  joint  and  several
          liability   hereunder   and  under  the  other   Loan   Documents   in
          consideration  of the financial  accommodations  to be provided by the
          Lenders and the Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement,  for
          the mutual benefit,  directly and indirectly, of each of the Borrowers
          and in  consideration  of the  undertakings  of each other Borrower to
          accept joint and several liability for the Obligations.

               (b)  Each  of  the  Borrowers,   jointly  and  severally,  hereby
          irrevocably and  unconditionally  accepts,  not merely as a surety but
          also as a  co-debtor,  joint  and  several  liability  with the  other
          Borrowers,  with respect to the payment and  performance of all of the
          Obligations  (including,  without limitation,  any Obligations arising
          under this ss.6.11), it being the intention of the parties hereto that
          all the Obligations shall be thE joint and several obligations of each
          of the Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them.

                                      -48-

               (c) If and to the extent that any of the Borrowers  shall fail to
          make any payment  with respect to any of the  Obligations  as and when
          due or to perform any of the  Obligations in accordance with the terms
          thereof,  then in each such event the other  Borrowers  will make such
          payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation.

               (d) The Obligations of each of the Borrowers under the provisions
          of this ss.6.11  constitute  the fulL recourse  Obligations of each of
          the Borrowers  enforceable against each such Person to the full extent
          of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity
          or enforceability of this Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents
          or any other circumstance whatsoever as to any other Borrower.

               (e) Except as otherwise  expressly provided herein, each Borrower
          hereby waives promptness,  diligence,  presentment,  demand,  protest,
          notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of any
          and all advances of the Loans made under this Credit Agreement and the
          Notes, notice of occurrence of any Default or Event of Default (except
          to the extent notice is expressly required to be given pursuant to the
          terms of this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents), or
          of any demand for any payment under this Credit  Agreement,  notice of
          any action at any time taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or
          the Lenders under or in respect of any of the  Obligations  hereunder,
          any requirement of diligence and, generally,  all demands, notices and
          other  formalities  of  every  kind in  connection  with  this  Credit
          Agreement and the other Loan  Documents.  Each Borrower  hereby waives
          all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation,  stay,
          moratorium  law or other  similar law now or hereafter in effect,  any
          right to require the  marshaling  of assets of the  Borrowers  and any
          other entity or Person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to
          any of the Obligations,  and all suretyship defenses  generally.  Each
          Borrower  hereby  assents to, and waives  notice of, any  extension or
          postponement  of the time for the  payment,  or  place or  manner  for
          payment, compromise, refinancing,  consolidation or renewals of any of
          the  Obligations  hereunder,  the  acceptance  of any partial  payment
          thereon,  any waiver,  consent or other action or  acquiescence by the
          Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders at any time or times in respect
          of any default by any Borrower in the  performance or  satisfaction of
          any term,  covenant,  condition or provision of this Credit  Agreement
          and the other Loan Documents, any and all other indulgences whatsoever
          by the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders in respect of any of the
          Obligations  hereunder,  and the  taking,  addition,  substitution  or
          release,  in whole or in part,  at any time or times,  of any security
          for any of such Obligations or the addition,  substitution or release,
          in whole or in part,  of any  Borrower  or any other  entity or Person
          primarily or  secondarily  liable for any  Obligation.  Such  Borrower
          further  agrees  that  its  Obligations   shall  not  be  released  or
          discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by the adequacy
          of any rights  which the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have
          against any collateral  security or other means of obtaining repayment

                                      -49-

          of any of the Obligations,  the impairment of any collateral  security
          securing the Obligations,  including,  without limitation, the failure
          to protect or preserve  any rights which the  Administrative  Agent or
          any Lender may have in such collateral  security or the  substitution,
          exchange,   surrender,  release,  loss  or  destruction  of  any  such
          collateral  security,  any other act or  omission  which  might in any
          manner or to any extent vary the risk of such  Borrower,  or otherwise
          operate as a release or discharge of such  Borrower,  all of which may
          be done without notice to such Borrower;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that the
          foregoing   shall  in  no  way  be  deemed   to  create   commercially
          unreasonable  standards  as to the  Administrative  Agent's  duties as
          secured party under the Loan  Documents (as such rights and duties are
          set forth  therein).  If for any reason any of the other Borrowers has
          no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of
          the   Obligations,   or  if  any  of  the   Obligations   have  become
          irrecoverable  from any of the other Borrowers by reason of such other
          Borrower's  insolvency,  bankruptcy  or  reorganization  or  by  other
          operation  of law or for any  reason,  this Credit  Agreement  and the
          other Loan  Documents  to which it is a party  shall  nevertheless  be
          binding on such Borrower to the same extent as if such Borrower at all
          times had been the sole obligor on such Obligations.  Without limiting
          the  generality of the foregoing,  each Borrower  assents to any other
          action  or  delay  in  acting  or  failure  to act on the  part of the
          Administrative Agent and the Lenders,  including,  without limitation,
          any failure  strictly or  diligently  to assert any right or to pursue
          any remedy or to comply  fully  with  applicable  laws or  regulations
          thereunder which might, but for the provisions of this ss.6.11, afford
          grounds for  terminating,  discharging or relieving such Borrower,  in
          whole or iN part, from any of its obligations  under this ss.6.11,  it
          being  the  intention  of each  Borrower  that,  so long as anY of the
          Obligations  hereunder  remain  unsatisfied,  the  obligations of such
          Borrower  under  this  ss.6.11  shall  not  bE  discharged  except  by
          performance  and then  only to the  extent  of such  performance.  The
          Obligations   of  each  Borrower  under  this  ss.6.11  shall  not  be
          diminished   or   rendered    unenforceable   by   any   winding   up,
          reorganization,  arrangement,  liquidation,  reconstruction or similar
          proceeding with respect to any  reconstruction  or similar  proceeding
          with respect to any other Borrower,  or any of the Lenders.  The joint
          and several  liability of the Borrowers  hereunder  shall  continue in
          full  force  and  effect   notwithstanding  any  absorption,   merger,
          amalgamation  or any other change  whatsoever in the name,  ownership,
          membership,  constitution or place of formation of any Borrower or the
          Lenders.  Each of the Borrowers  acknowledges and confirms that it has
          itself  established  its own adequate  means of obtaining from each of
          the other Borrowers on a continuing  basis all information  desired by
          such Borrower  concerning the financial condition of each of the other
          Borrowers  and that each such  Borrower will look to each of the other
          Borrowers and not to the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender in order
          for such  Borrower to keep  adequately  informed of changes in each of
          the other Borrowers' respective financial conditions.

                                      -50-

               (f) The  provisions  of this  ss.6.11 are made for the benefit of
          the  Lenders  and  the  AdministrativE   Agent  and  their  respective
          permitted  successors  and assigns,  and may be enforced by it or them
          from  time to time  against  any or all of the  Borrowers  as often as
          occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of the
          Lenders or the Administrative  Agent or such successor or assign first
          to marshall  any of its or their  claims or to exercise  any of its or
          their  rights  against  any of the other  Borrowers  or to exhaust any
          remedies available to it or them against any of the other Borrowers or
          to resort to any other source or means of obtaining  payment of any of
          the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions
          of this ss.6.11  shalL  remain in effect until all of the  Obligations
          shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully  satisfied.  If at any
          time, any payment, or any part thereof,  made in respect of any of the
          Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by
          any Lender or the Administrative Agent upon the insolvency, bankruptcy
          or  reorganization  of  any  of  the  Borrowers,  or  otherwise,   the
          provisions of this ss.6.11 will forthwith be reinstateD in effect,  as
          though such payment had not been made.

               (g) Each of the Borrowers  hereby agrees that it will not enforce
          any of its rights of reimbursement,  contribution,  subrogation or the
          like  against  the  other  Borrowers  with  respect  to any  liability
          incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any
          payments made by it to any of the Lenders or the Administrative  Agent
          with  respect to any of the  Obligations  or any  collateral  security
          therefor  until  such  time  as  all  of  the  Obligations  have  been
          irrevocably  paid in full in cash.  Any claim which any  Borrower  may
          have  against any other  Borrower  with respect to any payments to the
          Lenders or the Administrative  Agent hereunder or under any other Loan
          Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of
          payment,  without  limitation as to any  increases in the  Obligations
          arising  hereunder or thereunder,  to the prior payment in full of the
          Obligations   and,  in  the  event  of  any  insolvency,   bankruptcy,
          receivership,  liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding
          under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts
          or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary,  all such Obligations
          shall  be paid in full  before  any  payment  or  distribution  of any
          character,  whether in cash,  securities or other  property,  shall be
          made to any other Borrower therefor.

               (h) Each of the  Borrowers  hereby agrees that the payment of any
          amounts due with respect to the indebtedness  owing by any Borrower to
          any other Borrower is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full
          in cash of the Obligations. Each Borrower hereby agrees that after the
          occurrence and during the  continuance  of any Event of Default,  such
          Borrower will not demand,  sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any
          indebtedness  of any other  Borrower  owing to such Borrower until the
          Obligations shall have been paid in full in cash. If,  notwithstanding
          the  foregoing  sentence,  such  Borrower  shall  collect,  enforce or
          receive  any  amounts in respect of such  indebtedness,  such  amounts

                                      -51-

          shall be collected,  enforced and received by such Borrower as trustee
          for the  Administrative  Agent and be paid over to the  Administrative
          Agent for the PRO RATA  accounts of the Lenders to be applied to repay
          the Obligations.

execution of this Credit  Agreement,  irrevocably  authorizes Furr's to give and
receive  all  notices  and  instructions,  to take all  actions  and  make  such
agreements  expressed to be capable of being given,  received or taken by Furr's
or any other Borrower under this Credit  Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
including, without limitation, the making of any Loan Requests on behalf of such
other Borrower,  and notwithstanding  that such notice,  instruction,  action or
agreement may affect such other  Borrower,  and each Borrower  shall, as regards
the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders,  be bound  thereby  as  though  the
Borrowers,  as  applicable,   itself  had  given  or  received  such  notice  or
instruction, taken such action or made such agreement.

7.   COLLATERAL SECURITY.

     7.1. SECURITY OF BORROWERS. The Obligations shall be secured by a perfected
first priority  security  interest  (subject only to Permitted Liens entitled to

including accounts and notes receivable,  inventory,  equipment,  real property,
licenses,  stock  of each  of the  Borrowers  (other  than  Furr's),  intangible

Obligations  shall not be increased by the issuance of the Collateral  Notes and
(b) any  payment or  recovery  on the  Collateral  Notes shall be applied to the
Obligations  pursuant to ss.14.4.  All Collateral  Notes shall be payable to the
order of the Administrative  Agent, on demand;  PROVIDED that thE Administrative

     four or five  weeks and  ending on the  dates set forth on  SCHEDULE  8.4.1
     hereto (with  quarter-end  dates in bold-face  type). The term "Fiscal Year
     XXXX",  where "XXXX" is a calendar year,  shall refer to the fiscal year of
     the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries ending during or within seven (7) days
     following the last day of such calendar year.

          8.4.2.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  There has been furnished to each of the
     Lenders  (a) a  consolidated  balance  sheet  of the  Borrowers  and  their
     Subsidiaries  as at December  28,  1999,  and a  consolidated  statement of
     income of the  Borrowers  and their  Subsidiaries  for the fiscal year then

     and (c) an  unaudited  monthly  consolidated  financial  statements  of the
     Borrowers  and their  Subsidiaries  as at  February 6, 2001.  Such  balance
     sheets and statements of income have been prepared in accordance  with GAAP
     (other  than the  omission  of  footnotes  as to the  financial  statements
     referred to in clause (c) above and fairly present the financial  condition
     of the  Borrowers  as at the close of business on the date  thereof and the
     results  of  operations  for the  fiscal  year  then  ended.  There  are no
     contingent liabilities of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries
     as of such date involving  material  amounts,  known to the officers of the
     Borrowers,  which were not  disclosed in such  balance  sheet and the notes
     related thereto.

          8.4.3.  PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET AND  PROJECTIONS.  The Borrowers  have
     delivered to the  Administrative  Agent a  consolidated  PRO FORMA  balance
     sheet as of the Closing Date  reflecting  the  borrowing  hereunder on such
     date,  which PRO FORMA balance sheet has been prepared in good faith on the
     basis of the  assumptions  stated  therein.  The  projections of the annual
     operating budgets of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries on a consolidated
     basis,  balance sheets and cash flow statements for the 2001 to 2005 fiscal
     years,  copies of which have been  delivered to each  Lender,  disclose all
     material  assumptions made with respect to general economic,  financial and
     market conditions used in formulating such projections. To the knowledge of
     any of the  Borrowers  or any of their  Subsidiaries,  no facts  exist that
     (individually  or in the  aggregate)  would result in any material  adverse
     change  in  any  of  such  projections.  The  projections  are  based  upon
     reasonable  estimates and  assumptions,  have been prepared on the basis of

                                      -54-

     the assumptions stated therein and reflect the reasonable  estimates of the
     Borrowers and their  Subsidiaries  of the results of  operations  and other
     information projected therein.

     statute, law, license,  rule or regulation  including,  without limitation,
     laws and regulations  relating to food or liquor,  occupational  health and
     safety, equal employment opportunities, fair employment practices, and sex,
     race,  religious or age discrimination,  in any of the foregoing cases in a
     manner that could  reasonably  be expected to result in the  imposition  of
     substantial  penalties or  materially  and  adversely  affect the financial
     condition,  properties or business of the Borrowers and their  Subsidiaries
     taken as a whole.  Any and all  approvals  by any  federal,  state or local
     liquor  authority  necessary for the continued  operation of any restaurant
     operated by any of the  Borrowers  or their  Subsidiaries  with full liquor
     service have been  received and remain in full force and effect.  As of the

     known conflict with any rights of others.

actions,  suits,  proceedings or  investigations  of any kind pending or, to the
best knowledge of the Borrowers,  threatened against any of the Borrowers or any
of their Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority,  that, (a) if adversely
determined,  might, either in any case or in the aggregate,  (i) have a Material
Adverse  Effect or (ii)  materially  impair the right of the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries,  considered as a whole, to carry on business  substantially as now
conducted by them, or result in any substantial liability not adequately covered
by  insurance,  or  for  which  adequate  reserves  are  not  maintained  on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, or (b) which
question  the  validity  of  this  Credit  Agreement  or any of the  other  Loan
Documents, or any action taken or to be taken pursuant hereto or thereto.

to have any Material Adverse Effect.

     8.9.  COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER  INSTRUMENTS,  LAWS, ETC. None of the Borrowers
nor any of their  Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its Governing
Documents, or any agreement or instrument to which it may be subject or by which
it or  any of its  properties  may be  bound  or any  decree,  order,  judgment,
statute,  license, rule or regulation, in any of the foregoing cases in a manner
that could result in the imposition of substantial  penalties or have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     8.10.  TAX STATUS.  Each of the Borrowers and their  Subsidiaries  (a) have
made or filed all federal,  state and foreign  income and all other tax returns,
reports and  declarations  required by any  jurisdiction to which any of them is
subject, (b) have paid all taxes and other governmental  assessments and charges
shown or determined to be due on such returns, reports and declarations,  except
those being contested in good faith and by appropriate  proceedings and (c) have
set aside on their books provisions  reasonably  adequate for the payment of all
taxes for periods  subsequent to the periods to which such  returns,  reports or
declarations  apply. There are no unpaid taxes in any material amount claimed to
be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction,  and none of the officers of
the Borrowers know of any basis for any such claim.

     8.11. NO EVENT OF DEFAULT.  No Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.

     8.12.  HOLDING  COMPANY AND INVESTMENT  COMPANY ACTS. None of the Borrowers

Permitted Liens and Liens which will be released simultaneously with the funding
of the Term Loans  contemplated by this Credit Agreement,  there is no financing
statement,  security agreement,  chattel mortgage, real estate mortgage or other
document  filed or recorded  with any filing  records,  registry or other public
office, that purports to cover, affect or give notice of any present or possible
future Lien on any assets or property  of any of the  Borrowers  or any of their
Subsidiaries or any rights relating thereto.

                                      -56-

     8.14. PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTEREST.  All filings,  assignments,  pledges
and deposits of documents or  instruments  have been made and all other  actions
have been taken that are  necessary  or  advisable,  under  applicable  law,  to
establish  and  perfect  the  Administrative  Agent's  security  interest in the
Collateral. The Collateral and the Administrative Agent's rights with respect to
the  Collateral  are not subject to any setoff,  claims,  withholdings  or other
defenses.  A Borrower or a Subsidiary of a Borrower party to one of the Security
Agreements  is the  owner of the  Collateral  free  from any  Lien,  except  for
Permitted Liens.

     8.15. CERTAIN  TRANSACTIONS.  Except for arm's length transactions pursuant
to which any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries makes payments in the
ordinary  course of business upon terms no less  favorable than such Borrower or
such  Subsidiary  could  obtain  from  third  parties,  none  of  the  officers,

furnishing  of  services  to or by,  providing  for  rental of real or  personal
property to or from,  or  otherwise  requiring  payments to or from any officer,
director  or  such  employee  or,  to  the  knowledge  of  the  Borrowers,   any
corporation,  partnership, trust or other entity in which any officer, director,
or any such  employee  has a  substantial  interest or is an officer,  director,
trustee or partner.

     8.16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

          8.16.1 . IN GENERAL.  Each Employee  Benefit Plan and each  Guaranteed
     Pension Plan has been maintained and operated in compliance in all material
     respects  with  the  provisions  of  ERISA  and  all   Applicable   Pension
     Legislation  and, to the extent  applicable,  the Code,  including  but not
     limited to the provisions thereunder respecting prohibited transactions and
     the  bonding  of  fiduciaries  and other  persons  handling  plan  funds as
     required by ss.412 of ERISA. The Borrowers have heretofore delivered to the
     Administrative  Agent (a) the most recently  completed annual report,  Form
     5500, with all required attachments, and actuarial statement required to be
     submitted under ss.103(d) of ERISA, with respect to each Guaranteed Pension
     Plan and (b) a copy of the Cavalcade Pension Plan.

          8.16.2 .  TERMINABILITY  OF WELFARE PLANS.  No Employee  Benefit Plan,
     which is an employee  welfare benefit plan within the meaning of ss.3(1) or
     ss.3(2)(B) of ERISA, provides benefit coverage subsequent to termination of
     employmeNt,  except  as  required  by  Title  I,  Part  6 of  ERISA  or the
     applicable state insurance laws. The Borrowers may terminate each such Plan
     at any time (or at any time  subsequent to the expiration of any applicable
     bargaining  agreement) in the discretion of the Borrowers without liability
     to any Person other than for claims arising prior to termination.

                                      -57-

          8.16.3 . GUARANTEED  PENSION PLANS. Each  contribution  required to be
     made to a Guaranteed Pension Plan, whether required to be made to avoid the
     incurrence  of an  accumulated  funding  deficiency,  the  notice  or  lien
     provisions of ss.302(f) of ERISA,  or  otherwise,  has been timely made. No
     waiver of an accumulated  funding  deficiency or extension of  amortization
     periods has been received with respect to any Guaranteed  Pension Plan, and
     none of the Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to or has posted
     security in  connection  with an  amendment  to a  Guaranteed  Pension Plan
     pursuant to ss.307 of ERISA or ss.401(a)(29)of the Code.No liability to the
     PBGC (other than required insurance premiums,  all of which have been paid)
     has been  incurred by any Borrower or any ERISA  Affiliate  with respect to
     any  Guaranteed  Pension  Plan and there has not been any ERISA  Reportable
     Event (other than an ERISA  Reportable Event as to which the requirement of
     30 days  notice has been  waived),  or any other event or  condition  which
     presents a material risk of termination  of any Guaranteed  Pension Plan by
     the PBGC.  Based on the most recent  valuation of each  Guaranteed  Pension
     Plan  occurring  prior to the Closing Date (as reported in the footnotes to
     the draft  financial  statements of the Borrowers for the Fiscal Year ended
     January 2, 2001) and on the actuarial methods and assumptions  employed for
     that valuation, on January 2, 2001 the aggregate benefit liabilities of all
     such  Guaranteed  Pension  Plans within the meaning of ss.4001 of ERISA did
     not exceed the aggregate value of the assets of all such Guaranteed Pension
     Plans by an amount in excess of $6,428,000,  disregarding  for this purpose
     the benefit  liabilities  and assets of any  Guaranteed  Pension  Plan with
     assets in excess of benefit liabilities.

          8.16.4 .  MULTIEMPLOYER  PLANS.  None of the  Borrowers  nor any ERISA
     Affiliate  has  incurred  any  material  liability   (including   secondary
     liability) to any  Multiemployer  Plan as a result of a complete or partial
     withdrawal  from such  Multiemployer  Plan  under  ss.4201 of ERISA or as a
     result of a sale of  assets  described  in  ss.4204  of ERISA.  None of the
     Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified that any  Multiemployer
     Plan is in  reorganization  or  insolvent  under and within the  meaning of
     ss.4241  or ss.4245 of ERISA or is at risk of  entering  reorganization  or
     becoming insolvent,  or that any Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or
     has been terminated under ss.4041A oF ERISA.

          8.17.1 . GENERAL. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used to refinance

     Letters  of  Credit  solely  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate
     purposes.

material  fact or omits to state a material  fact (known to any of the Borrowers
or any of their  Subsidiaries  in the case of any  document or  information  not
furnished  by it or any of its  Subsidiaries)  necessary  in  order  to make the
statements  herein or therein not  misleading.  There is no fact known to any of

or which is reasonably  likely in the future to have a Material  Adverse Effect,
exclusive  of effects  resulting  from changes in general  economic  conditions,
legal standards or regulatory conditions.

Administrative  Agent of all the  Capital  Stock of the  Borrowers  (other  than
Furr's) and the realization by the  Administrative  Agent on such pledge),  will

shall mean that the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (a)
will be able to pay their Debts (as defined  below) as they become due, (b) will
have  property  which will have a present  "fair  saleable  value" (as described
below) greater on a going-concern  basis than their probable  liability on their
Debts  as they  become  absolute  and  matured,  (c)  will  have  property  on a
going-concern  basis that will have a "fair saleable value" greater than the sum
of all  their  Debts,  and (d)  both  before  and  after  giving  effect  to the

engaged in any businesses or transactions  for which they have on a consolidated

basis of the amount  which may be  realized  within a  reasonable  time,  either
through  collection  or  sale of  such  property  at the  regular  market  value
(determined  as the amount  which could be obtained for the property in question

                                      -61-

within such period by a capable and diligent  business Person from an interested
buyer who is willing to purchase under ordinary selling conditions); and "Debts"
means all  liabilities,  obligations,  commitments  and  indebtedness of any and
every kind and nature  (including all obligations to trade  creditors),  whether
heretofore,  now,  or  hereafter  owing,  arising,  due or payable by any of the

incurred,  acquired or owing, whether primary,  secondary,  direct,  contingent,
fixed or otherwise.

Lien or charge upon any of its property; PROVIDED that any such tax, assessment,
charge,  levy or claim need not be paid if the validity or amount  thereof shall
currently  be  contested in good faith by  appropriate  proceedings  and if such
Borrower or such Subsidiary shall have set aside on its books adequate  reserves
with respect thereto; PROVIDED FURTHER that each Borrower and each Subsidiary of
the Borrowers will pay all such taxes,  assessments,  charges,  levies or claims

                                      -68-

     material adverse developments have occurred on any Mortgaged Property which
     might  violate or result in a condition  which  violates any  Environmental
     Laws,  the  Administrative  Agent may, in its discretion for the purpose of
     assessing and ensuring the value of any Mortgaged  Property,  obtain one or
     more  environmental  assessments  or  audits  of  such  Mortgaged  Property

     confirm  (a)  whether any  Hazardous  Materials  are present in the soil or
     water at such  Mortgaged  Property and (b) whether the use and operation of
     such Mortgaged Property complies with all Environmental Laws. Environmental
     assessments may include without  limitation  detailed visual inspections of

     expense of the Borrowers.  No more than one such assessment with respect to
     each Mortgaged Property shall be made in any twelve month period unless the
     Administrative  Agent  reasonably   determines  that  significant  material
     changes  have  occurred  on such  Mortgaged  Property  since  the  previous
     assessment  thereof  and will be  conducted  in such a  manner  as will not
     unnecessarily  interfere with a Borrower's  operations.  The Administrative

     and (viii) the aggregate  value of capital stock issued by the Borrowers in
     payment for any Permitted  Acquisitions  shall not exceed $7,500,000 during
     the term of this Credit Agreement. Nothing in this ss.10.5.3 is intended to
     prohibit  any  Borrower  or  any  of  the  Borrowers'   Subsidiaries   from
     conditionally  agreeing  to any asset or stock  acquisition  subject to the
     prior approval of the Required  Lenders if such Borrower or Subsidiary will

lease other property that any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower intends
to use  for  substantially  the  same  purpose  as the  property  being  sold or
transferred (a "SALE-LEASEBACK");  PROVIDED that, so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing,  a Borrower or a Borrower's Subsidiary may enter
into a  Sale-Leaseback  with  respect to Units or a leasehold or fee interest in
Real Estate if (a) the terms of the sale as such are  comparable  to terms which
could  be  obtained  in an arms  length  sale  among  unaffiliated  parties  not
involving a  Sale-Leaseback  transaction  and (b) the terms of the lease as such
are  comparable  to terms which  could be obtained in an arms length  commercial
operating lease among unaffiliated  parties and, PROVIDED FURTHER that, assuming
that such  Sale-Leaseback  (and any  repayment of  Indebtedness  in  conjunction
therewith)  had  occurred  immediately  prior to the period of four  consecutive
fiscal  quarters  most recently  ended,  no Event of Default would have occurred
under ss.11 after  giving  effect to such  Sale-Leaseback  (such  Sale-Leaseback
referred to herein as a "PERMITTED SALE-LEASEBACK"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary  set forth in  ss.4.4.2.3  and  ss.4.4.2.4 , (x) if a Unit which is
sold in connectIon with a Permitted Sale-Leaseback was acquired by a Borrower or
a Subsidiary of a Borrower within the 180-day period  immediately  preceding the

calculation  of  Consolidated  Excess  Operating Cash Flow in the current fiscal
period or any prior  period any Capital  Expenditures  associated  with the Unit
sold in connection with such Permitted Sale-Leaseback, the Borrowers shall apply

Loans (but the Total Revolving  Commitment shall not be reduced by the amount of
such payment) and so long as no Event of Default is then continuing,  any excess
Net Cash Proceeds remaining after the Revolving Credit Loans have been repaid in
full may be retained by the Borrowers.  The  Administrative  Agent shall release
any  Collateral  disposed of by such Borrower or any Subsidiary of such Borrower

                                      -78-

if such disposition is in compliance with ss.10.5.2 and otherwise with the terms
hereof.

          (c) fail to  contribute  to any  Guaranteed  Pension Plan to an extent
     which,  or terminate any Guaranteed  Pension Plan in a manner which,  could
     result in the  imposition of a lien or  encumbrance on the assets of any of

     of ERISA; or

          (d) amend any Guaranteed  Pension Plan in circumstances  requiring the
     posting of  security  pursuant to ss.307 of ERISA or  ss.401(a)(29)  of the

     projected  benefit  obligations  as  determined  for  financial  accounting
     purposes  of all  Guaranteed  Pension  Plans  exceeding  the  value  of the
     aggregate  assets of such Plans by an amount which at the relevant  time of

          (m)  there  shall  occur any  material  damage  to, or loss,  theft or
     destruction  of, any  Collateral,  whether or not  insured,  or any strike,
     lockout, labor dispute, embargo,  condemnation, act of God or public enemy,
     or other casualty, which in any such case causes, for more than thirty (30)
     consecutive  days,  the  cessation or  substantial  curtailment  of revenue
     producing  activities  at any  facility of any of the  Borrowers  or any of
     their Subsidiaries if such event or circumstance is not covered by business
     interruption insurance and would have a Material Adverse Effect;

          (n) there  shall  occur  the loss,  suspension  or  revocation  of, or
     failure to renew,  any license or permit now held or hereafter  acquired by
     any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries if such loss, suspension,
     revocation or failure to renew would have a Material Adverse Effect;

          (o)  any  of the  Borrowers  or any of  their  Subsidiaries  shall  be
     indicted  for a state or federal  crime,  or any civil or  criminal  action

                                      -90-

     shall  otherwise  have been brought  against any of the Borrowers or any of
     their  Subsidiaries,  a punishment for which in any such case could include
     the forfeiture of any assets of such Borrower or such  Subsidiary  having a
     fair market value in excess of $500,000;

          (p) a Change of Control shall occur; or

          (q) (i) either the Chief Executive  Officer or Chief Financial Officer
     shall cease,  for any reason,  to be employed in such  capacity with Furr's
     and there shall not be a  replacement  Person  employed in such  management
     position  with  similar  duties  and  responsibilities,  who is  reasonably
     acceptable  to the Required  Lenders  within one hundred  twenty (120) days
     after the occurrence of such event;

then,  and in any  such  event,  so  long as the  same  may be  continuing,  the
Administrative Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, by
notice in writing to the  Borrowers  declare all amounts  owing with  respect to
this  Credit  Agreement,  the  Notes  and  the  other  Loan  Documents  and  all
Reimbursement  Obligations  to be, and they shall  thereupon  forthwith  become,
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers; PROVIDED
that in the event of any Event of Default specified in ss.ss.14.1(g) or 14.1(h),
all such amounts  shall become  immediately  due and payable  automatically  and
without any requiremEnt of notice from the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

     14.2.  TERMINATION  OF  COMMITMENTS.  If any one or more of the  Events  of
Default specified in ss.14.1(g) or ss.14.1(h) shall occur, any unused portion of
the credit hereunder shall forthwith  terminate and each of the Lenders shall be
relieved  of all  further  obligations  to make Loans to the  Borrowers  and the
Administrative  Agent shall be relieved  of all  further  obligations  to issue,
extend or renew  Letters of  Credit.  If any other  Event of Default  shall have
occurred  and be  continuing,  or if on any  Drawdown  Date or  other  date  for
issuing,  extending or renewing any Letter of Credit the conditions precedent to
the making of the Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date or (as the case may be)
to issuing,  extending or renewing  such Letter of Credit on such other date are
not  satisfied,  the  Administrative  Agent  may and,  upon the  request  of the
Required  Lenders,  shall,  by notice to the  Borrowers,  terminate  the  unused
portion of the credit  hereunder,  and upon such notice  being given such unused
portion of the credit  hereunder  shall  terminate  immediately  and each of the
Lenders  shall be  relieved  of all  further  obligations  to make Loans and the
Administrative  Agent shall be relieved  of all  further  obligations  to issue,
extend or renew Letters of Credit.  No termination of the credit hereunder shall
relieve  any  of  the  Borrowers  or any  of  their  Subsidiaries  of any of the
Obligations.

     14.3. REMEDIES. In case any one or more of the Events of Default shall have
occurred  and  be  continuing,  and  whether  or  not  the  Lenders  shall  have
accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to ss.14.1,  each Lender, if owed
any amounT  with  respect  to the Loans or the  Reimbursement  Obligations,  may

                                      -91-

proceed to protect and  enforce  its rights by suit in equity,  action at law or
other  appropriate  proceeding,  whether  for the  specific  performance  of any
covenant or  agreement  contained  in this Credit  Agreement  and the other Loan
Documents or any instrument pursuant to which the Obligations to such Lender are
evidenced,  including  as permitted by  applicable  law the  obtaining of the EX
PARTE  appointment of a receiver,  and, if such amount shall have become due, by
declaration  or otherwise,  proceed to enforce the payment  thereof or any other
legal or  equitable  right of such  Lender;  provided  that  unless  an Event of
Default  is then  continuing  under  ss.14.1(a)  or (b) with  respect to amounts
payable to such  Lender,  such  Lender  may not  exercise  its rights  hereunder
withouT the prior consent of the Required  Lenders.  No remedy herein  conferred
upon  any  Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent  or the  holder  of any Note or
purchaser of any Letter of Credit  Participation  is intended to be exclusive of
any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be  cumulative  and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given  hereunder or now or hereafter  existing at
law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.


     14.4. DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS. In the event that, following the
occurrence   and  during  the   continuance   of  any  Event  of  Default,   the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender,  as the case may be, receives any monies in
connection with the enforcement of any the Security Documents, or otherwise with
respect to the  realization  upon any of the  Collateral,  such monies  shall be
distributed for application as follows:

          (a)  First,   to  the  payment  of,  or  (as  the  case  may  be)  the
     reimbursement  of  the  Administrative  Agent  for  or in  respect  of  all
     reasonable costs, expenses,  disbursements and losses which shall have been
     incurred or sustained by the  Administrative  Agent in connection  with the
     collection of such monies by the  Administrative  Agent,  for the exercise,
     protection or enforcement by the Administrative  Agent of all or any of the
     rights,  remedies,  powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent under
     this Credit  Agreement or any of the other Loan  Documents or in respect of
     the Collateral or in support of any provision of adequate  indemnity to the
     Administrative Agent against any taxes or liens which by law shall have, or
     may have,  priority  over the  rights of the  Administrative  Agent to such
     monies;

          (b) Second,  to all other  Obligations  in such order or preference as
     the  Required   Lenders  may  determine;   PROVIDED,   HOWEVER,   that  (i)
     distributions  shall be made (A) PARI PASSU among  Obligations with respect
     to the  Administrative  Agent's fee and all other  Obligations and (B) with
     respect to each type of Obligation owing to the Lenders,  such as interest,
     principal,  fees and  expenses,  among the Lenders  PRO RATA,  and (ii) the
     Administrative  Agent may in its discretion  make proper  allowance to take
     into account any Obligations not then due and payable;

          (c) Third,  upon payment and  satisfaction in full or other provisions
     for payment in full  satisfactory  to the  Lenders  and the  Administrative
     Agent of all of the Obligations, to the payment of any obligations required

                                      -92-

     to be paid pursuant to ss.9-504(1)(c) of the Uniform Commercial Code of the
     Commonwealth oF Massachusetts; and

          (d) Fourth,  the excess, if any, shall be returned to the Borrowers or
     to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

15. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

     15.1. AUTHORIZATION.

          (a) The  Administrative  Agent is  authorized  to take such  action on
     behalf  of each of the  Lenders  and to  exercise  all such  powers  as are
     hereunder  and  under  any of the  other  Loan  Documents  and any  related
     documents delegated to the Administrative  Agent, together with such powers
     as are reasonably  incident thereto,  including the authority,  without the
     necessity of any notice to or further consent of the Lenders,  from time to
     time to take any action  with  respect to any  Collateral  or the  Security
     Documents which may be necessary to perfect,  maintain  perfected or insure
     the  priority of the  security  interest  in and liens upon the  Collateral
     granted  pursuant to the  Security  Documents,  PROVIDED  that no duties or
     responsibilities  not expressly  assumed herein or therein shall be implied
     to have been assumed by the Administrative Agent.

          (b) The relationship  between the Administrative Agent and each of the
     Lenders  is  that  of an  independent  contractor.  The  use  of  the  term
     "ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT" is for convenience only and is used to describe, as
     a form of convention,  the independent contractual relationship between the
     Administrative  Agent and each of the  Lenders.  Nothing  contained in this
     Credit  Agreement nor the other Loan Documents shall be construed to create
     an agency, trust or other fiduciary relationship between the Administrative
     Agent and any of the Lenders.

          (c) As an independent  contractor empowered by the Lenders to exercise
     certain rights and perform  certain duties and  responsibilities  hereunder
     and  under  the  other  Loan  Documents,   the   Administrative   Agent  is
     nevertheless a "REPRESENTATIVE"  of the Lenders, as that term is defined in
     Article 1 of the Uniform  Commercial  Code, for purposes of actions for the
     benefit of the Lenders  and the  Administrative  Agent with  respect to all
     collateral security and guaranties contemplated by the Loan Documents. Such
     actions  include the  designation of the  Administrative  Agent as "SECURED
     PARTY",  "MORTGAGEE"  or the like on all  financing  statements  and  other
     documents and instruments,  whether recorded or otherwise,  relating to the
     attachment,  perfection, priority or enforcement of any security interests,
     mortgages or deeds of trust in collateral  security  intended to secure the
     payment or  performance of any of the  Obligations,  all for the benefit of
     the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.

                                      -93-

     15.2.  EMPLOYEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENTS.  The Administrative  Agent may
exercise its powers and execute its duties by or through employees or agents and
shall be  entitled to take,  and to rely on,  advice of counsel  concerning  all
matters  pertaining to its rights and duties under this Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent may utilize the services of such
Persons  as the  Administrative  Agent in its  sole  discretion  may  reasonably
determine,  and all  reasonable  fees and expenses of any such Persons  shall be
paid by the Borrowers.

     15.3.  NO  LIABILITY.  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent  nor  any of its
shareholders,  directors,  officers or employees nor any other Person  assisting
them in their duties nor any agent or employee thereof,  shall be liable for any
waiver,  consent or approval given or any action taken,  or omitted to be taken,
in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan  Documents,
or in connection  herewith or therewith,  or be responsible for the consequences
of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Administrative
Agent or such other Person,  as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to
its willful misconduct or gross negligence.

     15.4. NO REPRESENTATIONS.

          15.4.1 GENERAL.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
     the execution or validity or enforceability  of this Credit Agreement,  the
     Notes,  the  Letters of  Credit,  any of the other  Loan  Documents  or any
     instrument at any time constituting, or intended to constitute,  collateral
     security for the Notes, or for the value of any such collateral security or
     for the  validity,  enforceability  or  collectability  of any such amounts
     owing  with  respect  to the  Notes,  or for any  recitals  or  statements,
     warranties  or  representations  made  herein or in any of the  other  Loan
     Documents or in any certificate or instrument  hereafter furnished to it by
     or on behalf of any of the  Borrowers or any of their  Subsidiaries,  or be
     bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
     the terms, conditions,  covenants or agreements herein or in any instrument
     at any time constituting,  or intended to constitute,  collateral  security
     for the Notes or to inspect any of the properties,  books or records of any
     of the Borrowers or any of their  Subsidiaries.  The  Administrative  Agent
     shall not be bound to  ascertain  whether  any notice,  consent,  waiver or
     request  delivered to it by the Borrowers or any holder of any of the Notes
     shall have been duly  authorized  or is true,  accurate and  complete.  The
     Administrative  Agent has not made nor does it now make any representations
     or warranties,  express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the
     Lenders,  with respect to the credit worthiness or financial  conditions of
     any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges
     that it has,  independently  and without  reliance upon the  Administrative
     Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such information and documents as
     it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own credit  analysis  and decision to
     enter into this Credit Agreement.

                                      -94-

          15.4.2 . CLOSING  DOCUMENTATION,  ETC.  For  purposes  of  determining
     compliance  with the  conditions  set forth in  ss.12,each  Lender that has
     executed  this  Credit  Agreement  shall be  deemed to have  consented  to,
     approved or accepted,  or to be satisfied  with,  each  document and matter
     either sent, or made available, by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger
     to such  Lender for  consent,  approval,  acceptance  or  satisfaction,  or
     required  thereunder to be to be consent to or approved by or acceptable or
     satisfactory to such Lender,  unless an officer of the Administrative Agent
     or the Arranger  active upon the  Borrower's  account  shall have  received
     notice from such Lender prior to the Closing Date  specifying such Lender's
     objection  thereto  and such  objection  shall not have been  withdrawn  by
     notice to the  Administrative  Agent or the  Arranger  to such effect on or
     prior to the Closing Date.

     15.5. PAYMENTS.

          15.5.1 . PAYMENTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT. A payment by the Borrowers
     to the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents
     for the account of any Lender  shall  constitute  a payment to such Lender.
     The Administrative  Agent agrees promptly to distribute to each Lender such
     Lender's PRO RATA share of payments  received by the  Administrative  Agent
     for the  account of the  Lenders  except as  otherwise  expressly  provided
     herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.

          15.5.2 .  DISTRIBUTION BY  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT. If in the opinion of
     the  Administrative  Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in
     such  capacity  hereunder,  under the Notes or under any of the other  Loan
     Documents  might  involve  it in  liability,  it may  refrain  from  making
     distribution   until  its  right  to  make  distribution  shall  have  been
     adjudicated by a court of competent  jurisdiction.  If a court of competent
     jurisdiction  shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the
     Administrative  Agent  is to be  repaid,  each  Person  to  whom  any  such
     distribution  shall have been made shall either repay to the Administrative
     Agent its  proportionate  share of the amount so  adjudged  to be repaid or
     shall  pay over the same in such  manner  and to such  Persons  as shall be
     determined by such court.

          15.5.3 . DELINQUENT LENDERS.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
     contained in this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,  any
     Lender that fails (a) to make available to the Administrative Agent its PRO
     RATA share of any Loan or to purchase any Letter of Credit Participation or
     (b) to  comply  with the  provisions  of  ss.17.1  with  respect  to making
     dispositions and arrangements  with the other Lenders,  where such Lender's
     share of any payment received, whether by setoff or otherwise, is in excess
     of its PRO  RATA  share  of such  payments  due and  payable  to all of the
     Lenders,  in each  case as,  when and to the full  extent  required  by the
     provisions  of  this  Credit  Agreement,  shall  be  deemed  delinquent  (a
     "DELINQUENT  LENDER")  and shall be deemed a  Delinquent  Lender until such

                                      -95-

     time as such delinquency is satisfied.  A Delinquent Lender shall be deemed
     to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrower,  whether
     on  account  of  outstanding  Loans,  Unpaid   Reimbursement   Obligations,
     interest,  fees or otherwise,  to the remaining  nondelinquent  Lenders for
     application  to, and reduction of, their  respective PRO RATA shares of all
     outstanding  Loans and Unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligations.  The  Delinquent
     Lender  hereby  authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent to  distribute  such
     payments to the nondelinquent Lenders in proportion to their respective PRO
     RATA shares of all outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement  Obligations.
     A Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency
     when and if, as a result of  application  of the  assigned  payments to all
     outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations of the nondelinquent
     Lenders,  the Lenders'  respective PRO RATA shares of all outstanding Loans
     and  Unpaid  Reimbursement  Obligations  have  returned  to those in effect
     immediately  prior to such  delinquency  and without  giving  effect to the
     nonpayment causing such delinquency.

     15.6.  HOLDERS OF NOTES.  The  Administrative  Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit  Participation as the
absolute owner or purchaser  thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have
been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent
holder, assignee or transferee.

     15.7.  INDEMNITY.  The Lenders  ratably  agree hereby to indemnify and hold
harmless the  Administrative  Agent and its affiliates  from and against any and
all  claims,  actions  and suits  (whether  groundless  or  otherwise),  losses,
damages,  costs,  expenses  (including any expenses for which the Administrative
Agent or such affiliate has not been  reimbursed by the Borrowers as required by
ss.17.2),  and  liabilities  of every  nature and  character  arising  out of or
related to thiS Credit Agreement,  the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents
or  the  transactions  contemplated  or  evidenced  hereby  or  thereby,  or the
Administrative  Agent's  actions taken  hereunder or  thereunder,  except to the
extent  that any of the same  shall be  directly  caused  by the  Administrative
Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

     15.8.  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT AS LENDER. In its individual  capacity,  Fleet
shall have the same  obligations  and the same rights,  powers and privileges in
respect to its Revolving  Commitment and the Loans made by it, and as the holder
of any of the Notes and as the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participations,
as it would have were it not also the Administrative Agent.

     15.9.  RESIGNATION.  The  Administrative  Agent  may  resign at any time by
giving  sixty (60) days prior  written  notice  thereof to the  Lenders  and the
Borrowers. Upon any such resignation,  the Required Lenders shall have the right
to appoint a successor  Administrative  Agent.  Unless an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing,  such successor  Administrative  Agent shall be
reasonably  acceptable to the Borrowers.  If no successor  Administrative  Agent

                                      -96-

shall have been so  appointed by the  Required  Lenders and shall have  accepted
such  appointment  within  thirty  (30) days after the  retiring  Administrative
Agent's giving of notice of resignation,  then the retiring Administrative Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders,  appoint a successor  Administrative Agent, which
shall be a  financial  institution  having a  rating  of not less  than A or its
equivalent by S&P.  Upon the  acceptance of any  appointment  as  Administrative
Agent   hereunder  by  a  successor   Administrative   Agent,   such   successor
Administrative  Agent shall thereupon  succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers,  privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent  shall be  discharged  from its  duties and
obligations  hereunder.  After any retiring  Administrative Agent's resignation,
the  provisions  of this Credit  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

     15.10.  NOTIFICATION OF DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  Each Lender hereby
agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event of Default,
it shall promptly notify the  Administrative  Agent thereof.  The Administrative
Agent hereby agrees that upon receipt of any notice under this ss.15.10 it shall
promptly  notify the other  Lenders of thE existence of such Default or Event of
Default.

     15.11.  DUTIES IN THE CASE OF  ENFORCEMENT.  In case one of more  Events of
Default have occurred and shall be continuing,  and whether or not  acceleration
of the Obligations shall have occurred,  the Administrative  Agent shall, if (a)
so requested by the  Required  Lenders and (b) the Lenders have  provided to the
Administrative Agent such additional indemnities and assurances against expenses
and liabilities as the Administrative  Agent may reasonably request,  proceed to
enforce the provisions of the Security  Documents  authorizing the sale or other
disposition  of all or any part of the  Collateral  and exercise all or any such
other legal and equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have in respect
of such Collateral.  The Required Lenders may direct the Administrative Agent in
writing as to the  method and the extent of any such sale or other  disposition,
the Lenders  hereby  agreeing to indemnify  and hold the  Administrative  Agent,
harmless  from all  liabilities  incurred  in  respect of all  actions  taken or
omitted in accordance  with such  directions,  PROVIDED that the  Administrative
Agent  need  not  comply  with  any  such  direction  to  the  extent  that  the
Administrative  Agent reasonably believes the Administrative  Agent's compliance
with  such  direction  to  be  unlawful  or  commercially  unreasonable  in  any
applicable jurisdiction.

16. ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATION.

     16.1. CONDITIONS TO ASSIGNMENT BY LENDERS.  Except as provided herein, each
Lender may assign to one or more commercial banks, other financial  institutions

STATEMENTS  (WHETHER  VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY,  INCLUDING ANY
COURSE  OF  CONDUCT,   COURSE  OF  DEALINGS,   STATEMENTS   OR  ACTIONS  OF  THE
ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT OR ANY LENDER RELATING TO THE  ADMINISTRATION OF THE LOANS
OR  ENFORCEMENT  OF THE  LOAN  DOCUMENTS  AND  AGREES  THAT IT WILL  NOT SEEK TO
CONSOLIDATE  ANY SUCH ACTION WITH ANY OTHER  ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT

waives any right it may have to claim or recover in any  litigation  referred to
in the  preceding  sentence any special,  exemplary,  punitive or  consequential
damages or any damages  other than,  or in addition  to,  actual  damages.  Each
Borrower (a) certifies that no  representative,  agent or attorney of any Lender
or the Administrative Agent has represented,  expressly or otherwise,  that such
Lender or the Administrative  Agent would not, in the event of litigation,  seek
to enforce the foregoing  waivers and (b) acknowledges  that the  Administrative
Agent and the Lenders have been induced to enter into this Credit Agreement, the
other Loan Documents to which it is a party by, among other things,  the waivers
and certifications contained herein.

     17.12. CONSENTS, AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. Any consent or approval required
or permitted  by this Credit  Agreement to be given by the Lenders may be given,
and any term of this Credit  Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents  or any other
instrument  related  hereto  or  mentioned  herein  may  be  amended,   and  the

of any terms of this Credit  Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents or such other
instrument or the  continuance  of any Default or Event of Default may be waived
(either  generally  or in a  particular  instance  and either  retroactively  or
prospectively)  with, but only with, the written consent of the Borrower and the
written  consent of the Required  Lenders.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no
amendment, modification or waiver shall:

          (a)  without  the  written  consent of the  Borrowers  and each Lender
     directly affected thereby:

                                     -108-

          effective date of any waiver by the Required Lenders of the Default or
          Event of Default relating thereto) or the amount of the Commitment Fee
          or Letter of Credit Fees or increase  the rate of interest on any Note
          if the rate of interest  is not  increased  proportionally  on all the
          Notes  or  amend  the  definition  of  Leverage  Ratio  or  any of the
          components  thereof or the method of calculation  thereof for purposes
          of calculating the Applicable Margin;

               (ii)  increase  the  amount  of  any  Lender's  Revolving  Credit
          Commitment,  Term A  Commitment,  or Term B  Commitment  or extend the
          expiration date of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment;

               (iii) postpone or extend the Revolving  Credit Maturity Date, the
          Term  A  Maturity  Date  or the  Term B  Maturity  Date  or any  other
          regularly  scheduled  dates for payments of principal  of, or interest
          on,  the  Loans  or  Reimbursement  Obligations  or any  Fees or other
          amounts payable to such Lender (it being  understood that (A) a waiver
          of the  application  of the  default  rate  of  interest  pursuant  to
          ss.6.10.2,  anD (B) any vote to rescind any acceleration made pursuant
          to  ss.14.1  of  amounts  owing  with  respect  to thE Loans and other
          Obligations and (C) any  modifications  of the provisions  relating to
          amounts,  timing  or  application  of  prepayments  of Loans and other
          Obligations, including under ss.ss.4.4.2.1,  4.4.2.2 And 4.4.2.3 shall
          require only the approval of the Required Lenders); and

               (iv) other than pursuant to a transaction  permitted by the terms
          of this Credit Agreement, release a material portion of the Collateral
          (excluding,  if any Borrower or any Subsidiary of a Borrower becomes a
          debtor  under  the  federal  Bankruptcy  Code,  the  release  of "cash
          collateral",  as defined in Section  363(a) of the federal  Bankruptcy
          Code  pursuant  to a  cash  collateral  stipulation  with  the  debtor
          approved by the Required Lenders);

          (b) without the written consent of all of the Lenders,  amend or waive
     this ss.17.12 or the definition of Required Lenders; or

          (c) without the written consent of the Administrative  Agent, amend or
     waive ss.15,  the amount or time oF payment of the  Administrative  Agent's
     Fee or any Letter of Credit  Fees  payable for the  Administrative  Agent's
     account or any other provision applicable to the Administrative Agent.

                                     -109-

No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or
impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission
on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right
shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice
to or demand upon the Borrowers shall entitle the Borrowers to other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

     17.13. SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Credit Agreement are severable
and if any one clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable
in  whole  or  in  part  in  any   jurisdiction,   then   such   invalidity   or
unenforceability shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in
such  jurisdiction,  and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision
in any other  jurisdiction,  or any other  clause or  provision  of this  Credit
Agreement in any jurisdiction.

     17.14.  USURY.  All agreements  between the Borrowers,  the  Administrative
Agent and the Lenders are hereby expressly  limited so that in no contingency or
event whatsoever,  whether by reason of acceleration of the maturity of any Note
or otherwise,  shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders and the
Administrative  Agent  for  the  use or  the  forbearance  of  the  Indebtedness
represented by the Notes exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law. In
this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Borrowers,  the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, in the execution,  delivery and acceptance
of the Notes, to contract in strict compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth
of  Massachusetts.  If,  under  any  circumstances  whatsoever,  performance  or
fulfillment  of any provision of the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents at
the time such provision is to be performed or fulfilled shall involve  exceeding
the limit of validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation so to be
performed  or  fulfilled  shall be reduced  automatically  to the limits of such
validity,  and if  under  any  circumstances  whatsoever  the  Lenders  and  the
Administrative  Agent  should ever  receive as  interest  an amount  which would
exceed the highest  lawful rate,  such amount which would be excessive  interest
shall be applied to the  reduction  of the  principal  balance  evidenced by the
Notes and not to the payment of interest.  The provisions of this ss.17.14 shall
control every other provision of this Credit Agreement and the Notes.
