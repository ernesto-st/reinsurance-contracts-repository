<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This Employment and Non-Competition Agreement (this &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made this 12th day of March,
2007 by and between National Interstate Corporation (&#147;NIC&#148;) and Alan R. Spachman (&#147;Spachman&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Recital: As part of the orderly development of NIC&#146;s management structure, NIC has named Spachman,
who is the founder of NIC and has served as its President since 1989 and as its Chairman since
2004, to the newly created post of Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;), effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, with
the expectation that, while he is in that post, Spachman will devote a substantial portion of his
efforts to the transition of his duties to his eventual successor as CEO. In connection with such
transition, this Agreement provides for Spachman&#146;s continuing employment by NIC for up to two years
after the appointment of a successor CEO.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement, NIC and Spachman agree as
follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">1.&nbsp;<U>Employment Term</U>. During the period specified in this Section&nbsp;1, NIC will employ
Spachman, and Spachman will be employed by NIC, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. The term of Spachman&#146;s employment under this Agreement (the &#147;Term&#148;) will
begin as of January&nbsp;1, 2007 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;), and, subject to prior termination as provided
in Section&nbsp;15, will continue through the date that is the first to occur of (a)&nbsp;the second
anniversary of the date (the &#147;Succession Date&#148;) on which an individual other than Spachman is
appointed CEO of NIC by the Board, or (b)&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2009; such period shall be referred to in
this Agreement as the &#147;Scheduled Term.&#148; The Term will be divided into two portions, the first of
which (the &#147;CEO Portion&#148;) will run from January&nbsp;1, 2007 through the Succession Date and the second
of which (the &#147;Post-CEO Portion&#148;) will run from the Succession Date through the end of the Term.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2.&nbsp;<U>Duties and Responsibilities</U>.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">(a)&nbsp;During the CEO Portion of the Term, Spachman will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of
NIC, in which capacity he will perform such duties and have such responsibilities, consistent
with his status as CEO, as may be assigned to him by the Board of Directors of NIC from time to
time, primarily focusing on strategic opportunities, public company responsibilities, and the
implementation of succession planning through development of a successor to himself as CEO.
During the CEO Portion of the Term, Spachman will devote such time to the business of and to the
furtherance of the purposes and objectives of NIC as may be necessary to perform the duties and
fulfill the responsibilities mutually agreed upon from time to time as contemplated above.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">(b)&nbsp;During the Post-CEO Portion of the Term, Spachman will serve as senior advisor, in which
capacity he will perform such duties and have such responsibilities as may be mutually agreed
upon between Spachman and the Board of Directors of NIC from time to time. During the Post-CEO
Portion of the Term, Spachman will devote such time to the business of and to the furtherance of
the purposes and objectives of NIC as may be necessary to perform the duties and fulfill the
responsibilities mutually agreed upon from time to time as contemplated above, and will be
entitled to engage in other remunerative activities, including part time employment by another
employer. During the Term and until the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;an executive of NIC obtaining
appropriate licenses in states necessary to maintain continuity of the business of NIC and its
subsidiaries or (ii)&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2007, Spachman will serve certain subsidiaries of NIC in such
executive capacities as may be mutually agreed upon from time to time by Spachman and the
respective Boards of Directors of such NIC subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">3.&nbsp;<U>Cash Compensation</U>. Throughout the Term, NIC will pay to Spachman base salary at the
rate of $330,000 per year together with a guaranteed bonus equal to 100% of base salary. The
combined total of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">base salary and 100% bonus (aggregating $660,000 per year) will be paid in equal
installments, subject to applicable withholding and in accordance with NIC&#146;s normal payroll
practice (with a partial installment due at the end of the Term if the end of the Term does not
coincide with the end of a payroll period).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">4.&nbsp;<U>Pre-2007 Bonuses</U>. In light of the guaranteed bonus to be paid to Spachman during the
Term, he will not be eligible to participate in NIC&#146;s Management Bonus Plan for 2007 or any later
year and he will not be entitled to any cash payment for any paid time off accruing after December
31, 2006. For purposes of determining Spachman&#146;s right to bonuses with respect to 2006 and any
earlier year, Spachman will be deemed to be in the active employ of NIC both throughout the Term
and, unless Spachman&#146;s employment under this Agreement is terminated for Cause pursuant to Section
15(c), indefinitely thereafter. Accordingly, any bonus payments attributable to 2006 or earlier
year results that would otherwise be paid to Spachman in 2007 or any later year (with the original
requirement that he be in the active employ of NIC at the scheduled time of the bonus payment) will
be paid to Spachman or to his estate (subject only to the requirement that his employment under
this Agreement not have been terminated for Cause before the scheduled time of the bonus payment).
Spachman will be entitled to payment, in 2007, for all accrued but unused paid time off that he has
accrued through December&nbsp;31, 2006, but will not be entitled to any cash payment for any paid time
off accruing after December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">5.&nbsp;<U>Stock Options</U>. Spachman holds options, granted under NIC&#146;s Long Term Incentive Plan, to
buy 80,000 Common Shares of NIC, which options are scheduled to vest at the rate of 16,000 per year
on January 1 of each year from 2006 through 2010. (32,000 shares vested as of January&nbsp;1, 2007.)
So long as Spachman is employed under this Agreement, these options will continue to vest in
accordance with the previously established schedule. Upon termination of his employment under this
Agreement for any reason other than termination for Cause pursuant to Section&nbsp;15(c), all then
unvested options will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of that termination and
Spachman (or his legal representative) will have a period of 90&nbsp;days following that termination
within which to exercise any and all of those option that then remain unexercised. The
Compensation Committee of NIC&#146;s Board of Directors will confirm the approval of these provisions in
a letter to be delivered to Spachman not later than 15&nbsp;days after execution of this Agreement by
both parties.

insurance benefits plans, including the Flexible Spending Account program, subject to normal
deductibles, premiums, and co-payments in effect from time to time; except that if Spachman
becomes eligible for substantially equivalent coverage at substantially equivalent cost from
another employer at any time during the Post-CEO Portion of the Term, Spachman&#146;s right to
participate in NIC&#146;s health insurance benefits plans will terminate not later than 90&nbsp;days after
Spachman becomes eligible for that substantially equivalent coverage. If, upon termination of
his employment with NIC, Spachman is eligible for continued benefits under COBRA, NIC will
provide him with written notification under separate cover.</DIV>

term disability coverage on substantially the same basis as was provided to him by NIC during
2006, except that NIC will not continue coverage to Spachman under the Company&#146;s supplemental
LTD program for officers after the next normal expiration date for the policy underlying that
program that occurs after January&nbsp;1, 2007.</DIV>

for NIC 401(k) profit sharing contributions on the same basis as other senior executive officers
throughout the Term.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">8.&nbsp;<U>Auto, Perquisites, and Office</U>. Throughout the Term, Spachman will be entitled to
continued use of an automobile (under NIC&#146;s Company Auto Program for Senior Officers), to all
standard officer perquisites, and to reimbursement for dues and fees at one country club, all at
substantially the same levels as in effect for Spachman during 2006. Throughout the CEO Portion of
the Term, Spachman will be entitled to the continued use of his current office, secretarial
services, and computer, telephone, and related support. Throughout the Post-CEO Portion of the
Term, Spachman will be entitled to the use of an appropriate office together with secretarial
services and computer, telephone, and related support, comparable to his current office and related
support.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">9.&nbsp;<U>Reimbursement for Expenses</U>. Subject to such limitations as may be reasonably imposed by
NIC from time to time, NIC will reimburse Spachman for reasonable, ordinary, and necessary business
expenses incurred by him in furtherance of NIC&#146;s business, provided Spachman accounts to NIC
therefore in a manner sufficient to substantiate deductions with respect to those expenses by NIC
for federal income tax purposes.

during and after Spachman&#146;s employment with NIC, Spachman will maintain the confidentiality of
Confidential Information and will refrain from using such Confidential Information (except in
connection with Spachman&#146;s job responsibilities) and disclosing it to anyone other than NIC, its
employees, and other entities that have a business relationship with NIC and a need for such
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Confidential Information&#148; is
information of NIC that Spachman would not have acquired but for his employment by NIC and that NIC
endeavors to keep confidential, including without limitation, and regardless of whether such
information is in a tangible medium of expression, accounting information, agency information,
broker-marketing information, claims information, customer service information, employee
information, financial information, information systems information, underwriting information, and
any information provided by a third party to NIC in confidence. At the termination of this
Agreement or otherwise upon NIC&#146;s demand, Spachman will provide to NIC all records containing
Confidential Information as well as any copies of it, including handwritten notes made or derived
from Confidential Information or records, all of which are the property of NIC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">11.&nbsp;<U>Activity Restraints</U>. Subject to the exceptions listed below, Spachman agrees that he
will not, during the Scheduled Term or at any time within 12&nbsp;months after the Scheduled Term,

shareholder, partner, member, agent, independent contractor, or consultant of any person, firm,

substantially the same as, or an adequate substitute for any insurance products of NIC and that
are, or could reasonably be anticipated to be, marketed or distributed in such a manner and in
such a geographic area as to actually compete with such insurance products of NIC.

need not be made simply because Spachman fails to succeed in the arbitration and related
proceedings).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">(c) <U>Interest</U>. If the arbitrator determines that NIC has failed to timely pay any amount
or provide any benefit to Spachman, Spachman will be entitled to receive, in addition to the
payment or benefit itself, interest on the unpaid amount or on the value of the benefit not
provided at a rate to be determined by the arbitrator from the date on which the payment or
benefit should have been made or provided to the date on which the payment or benefit is made or
provided.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">(d) <U>Injunctive Relief</U>. Any party to a dispute, claim, or controversy described in
Section 17(a) will be entitled to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive
relief at any time before the arbitrator has been appointed and has affirmatively accepted the
obligation to determine the extent to which injunctive relief should be continued or granted.
Any injunctive relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction will be subject to
modification or termination by the arbitrator once the arbitrator has affirmatively accepted
that obligation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">18.&nbsp;<U>Notices</U>. Any notice, request or instruction to be given hereunder by either party to
the other will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given (a)&nbsp;when it is delivered in
person to Spachman or to the individual to whose attention notices to NIC are to be given, as the
case may be, or (b)&nbsp;the first business
day after it is sent by nationally recognized overnight courier, addressed as provided below, or to
such other addresses as may be designated by written notice to the other party:

the risk written shall be assumed by a Spachman-controlled company. This would include any
indirect costs such as guarantee fund assessments and forced writings (specifically including any

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Services. </B>Support services shall be limited to IT support in customizing NIC&#146;s POINT system and

will take approximately 90&nbsp;days. In addition, audit services shall be provided along with a
product manager, if needed. It is not intended that underwriting, claims or other customer
services be provided by NIC. The Spachman-controlled company will arrange and pay for any needed
licensing for the IT systems.

taxes and other costs of providing paper with an appropriate profit margin. Service fees shall be
at market and are intended to fully reimburse National Interstate for related costs plus an
appropriate profit margin.

or other appropriate means to ensure direct access to such security by NIC. The amount of such
security shall be determined including consideration of catastrophe exposure and forced writings
(direct or indirect) . Directors with substantial reinsurance experience, Messrs.&nbsp;Gruber and
Consolino, shall be responsible for approval of any proposed security arrangement, after their
review and consultation with the entire Board of Directors.

ownership of the new Texas insurance company to be founded by Spachman.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Governance and Oversight. </B>The execution and performance of these terms shall be monitored and
approved by a subcommittee of the Board of Directors as established by the Board of Directors. The
initial composition of such subcommittee shall be Directors Consolino, Jensen, Larson, and
Schiavone. In addition, the Audit Committee, pursuant to its Charter, shall continue to review all
potential conflicts of interest and approve all related party transactions.
