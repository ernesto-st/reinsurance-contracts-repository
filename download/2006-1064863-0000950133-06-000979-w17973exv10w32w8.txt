SECTION 2.05 MODIFICATION TO ARTICLE 10, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT

     Section 10.03, Delivery Supplement Payment, is modified as follows:

                    "SECTION 10.03 DELIVERY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT (DSP).

                    HHSC shall pay to CONTRACTOR a one-time-per-pregnancy
               Delivery Supplemental Payment (DSP) in the amount of $3,000.00
               for each live or still-birth delivery. The one-time payment is
               made regardless of whether there is a single birth or multiple
               births at the time of delivery. For purposes of this section, a
               "delivery" is the birth of a live-born infant, regardless of the
               duration of the pregnancy, or a stillborn (fetal death) infant of
               22 weeks or more gestation.

                    CONTRACTOR should make its best effort to report all
               deliveries to the Administrative Services Contractor within 10
               days of the delivery and no later than 45 days from the date of
               delivery. No DSP will be made for deliveries that are not
               reported by CONTRACTOR to the Administrative Services Contractor
               within 120 days from the receipt of claim, or within 60 days from
               the date of discharge from the hospital for the stay related to
               the delivery, whichever is later.

                    CONTRACTOR must also submit a monthly DSP report to HHSC
               that includes the data elements specified by HHSC. The report to
               HHSC must be submitted in the format specified by HHSC in
               Appendix E.8 to this Agreement. The report must include only
               unduplicated deliveries. The report must include only deliveries
               for which CONTRACTOR has made a payment for the delivery, to
               either a hospital or other provider. No DSP will be made for
               deliveries which are not reported by CONTRACTOR to HHSC within
               120 days after the date of delivery, or within 60 days from the
               date of discharge from the hospital for the stay related to the
               delivery, whichever is later.

                    CONTRACTOR must maintain complete claims and adjudication
               disposition documentation, including paid and denied amounts for
               each delivery. CONTRACTOR must submit the documentation to HHSC
               within five (5) days from the date of a HHSC request for
               documentation.

                    HHSC reserves the right to audit the claims submitted for
               DSP to ensure the accuracy of those claims. The DSP will be paid
               to

               this Agreement. Subcontracts entered into after the Effective
               Date of this Agreement must be submitted no later than 30 days
               prior to the date of execution of the Subcontract. CONTRACTOR
               must also make Non-Provider Subcontracts available to HHSC upon
               request, at the time and location requested by HHSC.

                    HHSC has 15 business days to review the Subcontract and
               recommend any suggestions or required changes. If HHSC has not
               responded to CONTRACTOR by the fifteenth day, CONTRACTOR may
               execute the Subcontract. HHSC reserves the right to request
               CONTRACTOR to modify any Subcontract that has been deemed
               approved.

                    The form and substance of all Subcontracts, including
               subsequent amendments, are subject to approval by HHSC. HHSC
               retains the

               authority to reject or require changes to any provisions of the
               Subcontract that do not comply with the requirements or duties
               and responsibilities of this Agreement or create significant
               barriers for HHSC in carrying out its duty to monitor compliance
               with the Agreement.

                    Additionally, if CONTRACTOR desires to enter into a
               Non-Provider Subcontract that has a value over $100,000,
               CONTRACTOR must obtain prior written approval from HHSC. HHSC
               reserves the right to require the replacement of any Non-Provider
               Subcontractor, which HHSC will not unreasonably require.

                    For SFY 2006, all current non-provider management and
               administrative subcontracts valued at $100,000 or more per year
               must be resubmitted to HHSC for review and approval. These
               subcontracts must be submitted to HHSC by September 30, 2005.
               HHSC approvals will be completed by November 30, 2005. HHSC
               reserves the right to request CONTRACTOR to modify any
               subcontract that has been executed and/or approved."

                             CHIP SCOPE OF BENEFITS

Covered CHIP services must meet the CHIP definition of "medically necessary."
"Medically necessary" health services are:

A. Physical:

-    Reasonable and necessary to prevent illnesses or medical conditions, or
     provide early screening, interventions, and/or treatments for conditions
     that cause suffering or pain, cause physical malformation or limitations in
     function, threaten to cause or worsen a disability, cause illness or
     infirmity of a Member, or endanger life;

-    provided at appropriate facilities and at the appropriate levels of care
     for the treatment of Members' medical conditions;

-    consistent with health care practice guidelines and standards that are
     issued by professionally recognized health care organizations or
     governmental agencies;

-    consistent with the diagnoses of the conditions; and

-    no more intrusive or restrictive than necessary to provide a proper balance
     of safety, effectiveness, and efficiency.

These "medically necessary" health services:

-    could not be omitted without adversely affecting the Member's physical
     health or the quality of care rendered.

B. Behavioral:

-    reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of a mental health
     or chemical dependency disorder or to improve or to maintain or to prevent
     deterioration of function resulting from the disorder; and

-    provided in accordance with professionally accepted clinical guidelines and
     standards of practice in behavioral health care.

Emergency care is a covered CHIP service. "Emergency" and "emergency condition"
means a medical condition of recent onset and severity, including, but not
limited to, severe pain that would lead a prudent layperson, possessing an
average knowledge of medicine and health, to believe that the child's condition,
sickness, or injury is of such a nature that failure to get immediate care could
result in:

-    placing the child's health in serious jeopardy;

-    serious impairment to bodily functions;

-    serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part;

-    serious disfigurement; or

-    in the case of a pregnant woman, serious jeopardy to the health of the
     fetus.

"Emergency services" and "emergency care" means health care services provided in
an in-network or out-of-network hospital emergency department or other
comparable facility by in-network or out-of network physicians, providers, or
facility staff to evaluate and stabilize medical conditions. Emergency services
also include, but are not limited to any medical screening examination or other
evaluation required by state or federal law that is necessary to determine
whether an emergency condition exists.

There is no lifetime maximum on benefits; however, 12-month period, enrollment
period (a 6-month period) or lifetime limitations do apply to certain services,
as specified in the following chart. If services with a 12-month limit are all
used within one 6-month enrollment period, these particular services are not
available during the second 6-month enrollment period. Co-pays apply until a
family reaches its specific cost-sharing maximum.

OBJECTIVE

All MCOs contracting with the State of Texas to arrange for or to provide
healthcare to enrollees in the CHIP Program must submit CHIP MCO FSRs for each
Service Delivery Area (SDA) in accordance with the Contract for Services between
HHSC and MCO and in accordance with the instructions below.

The MCO must also submit Delegated Network (DN) FSRs for each entity in each SDA
with which the MCO subcontracts the responsibility to arrange for or to provide
healthcare services to CHIP Program enrollees in accordance with the CHIP
Program DN FSR Instructions for Completion. DN FSR reporting is not required for
"global" capitation related to dental, vision, or behavioral health services.

GENERAL

All CHIP MCO FSRs must be completed using the locked Microsoft Excel template
provided by HHSC. Data integrity is critical to the automated compilation of the
data. Do not alter the file name, sheet names, existing cell locations, or
formatting of the data in the file and sheets. Do not add or delete any columns
or rows. ANY DEVIATIONS FROM THE LOCKED TEMPLATE WILL RENDER THE FSR UNREADABLE
BY THE SOFTWARE APPLICATION AND THEREFORE UNACCEPTABLE TO HHSC.

All shaded data fields in the FSR represent fields where data input is required.
All data fields not shaded represents referenced data or calculations. All line
numbers in these instructions refer to the line numbers in column A on each
worksheet.

The following note is included on all FSR pages "NOTE: REPORTING IS ON AN
INCURRED BASIS. ALL PRIOR MONTHS' DATA MUST BE UPDATED TO REFLECT EACH REPORTED

PART 4: TOTAL MEDICAL EXPENSES, ALL COVERAGE GROUPS COMBINED - PAGE 7

Line 1 Physician Services, Primary Care Enter all paid expenses related to the
medical care provided to a member-patient by a physician (M.D. and D.O.) upon
first contact with the health care system for treatment of an illness or injury
before referral. The PCP performs or directs the performance of primary care
services which include, but are not limited to, case management, consultations,
family planning, emergency room visits, inpatient visits, maternity care
services, office visits, preventive care services, dispensing or prescribing
medical supplies and Pharmaceuticals, authorizing referrals to specialists, etc.

Under the Texas Medicaid Managed Care Program, all members are required to have
a primary care physician (PCP) when enrolling in a MCO. For expenses to be
classified as PCP services, the performing provider at 24K on a CMS-1500 claim
must be the member-patient's assigned PCP, and the services do not represent
Deliveries - Professional Component. The total amount paid covering all charges
on a CMS-1500 claim is classified as PCP expense when the performing provider is
the member-patient's PCP.

Line 2 Physician Services, Specialist Enter all paid expenses related to the
medical care provided to a patient by a physician (M.D. and D.O.) whose practice
is limited to a particular branch of medicine or surgery, e.g., cardiology or
radiology, in which a physician specializes and/or is certified by a board of
physicians. Generally, a member-patient must have a referral authorized by
his/her assigned PCP to receive services from a specialist.

For expenses to be classified as Specialist Physician Services, the performing
provider identified at 24K on a CMS-1500 claim must be a physician who is not
the member-patient's assigned PCP, and the services do not represent Deliveries
- Professional Component. The total amount paid covering all charges on a
CMS-1500 claim is classified as Specialist Physician Services when the
performing provider is a physician who is not the member-patient's PCP.

Line 3 Physician Services, Deliveries - Professional Component Enter paid
expenses for the services of the delivering physician and the anesthesiologist,
unless they are billed as part of the facility charge. Only the delivering
physician and the anesthesiologist charges are included on Line 3, as they are
the only charges included in the professional component of the DSP. Only those
amounts paid for charges on a CMS-1500 claim identified with Delivery CPT Codes
(and the HCPCS Codes with Modifiers for the FQHCs and RHCs) are classified as
Delivery -- Professional Component. All other amounts paid for charges on the
same CMS-1500 claim that are not identified with Delivery Procedure Codes are
classified as PCP or Specialist based on the criteria at Lines 1 and 2,
respectively.

services, radiology services, respiratory therapy services, and diagnostic
studies, such as EKGs, CT scans, and supplies are also included on Line 5.
Excludes any non-staff, attending or consulting physician; billed separately as
PCP and/or specialist services. The total amount paid by the MCO or DN covering
all charges on a UB 92 claim that are incurred during an emergency room
encounter are classified as Emergency Room Services. Any amount(s) paid for any
charges on a UB 92 claim that include emergency room services that were incurred
on a different service date than the emergency room encounter are classified as
Outpatient Facility Services, unless they represent (an) additional emergency
room encounter(s).

Line 6 Outpatient Facility Services Enter all paid expenses for services

classified as Behavioral Health Services. Any amount(s) paid for any charges on
the same CMS-1500 or UB-92 claim that are not identified with Behavioral Health
Services ICD-9 and/or Revenue Codes should be classified in the appropriate
medical expense classification. DN FSR reporting is not required for "global"
capitation related to behavioral health services.

Line 10 Other Medical Services Enter all paid expenses of all medical services
and supplies rendered that are not classified in any of the medical expense
classifications above. Other Medical Expenses include, but are not limited to,
ambulance services and durable medical equipment (DME), oxygen, and other

-    Any capitation payable to providers, and

-    Any reinsurance payable to reinsurers for ceded risk, net of any
     reinsurance receivable for assumed risk.

The IBNR medical expenses accrual is an estimate of the expected healthcare
expenses incurred but not paid based on claims lag schedules and completion
factors, as well as, any counts of services rendered but not billed, e.g.,
pre-authorized hospital days. Any major change in the claims processing function
that was not in effect during the period of time covered by the lag schedules
could materially impact the estimated IBNR accrual; hence, actuarial judgment
and adjustment may sometimes be needed.

the affiliate on behalf of the MCO that are charged to the Texas Medicaid SDA
operations, which are not allocable to Lines 1 through 18. An MCO paying any
management fees to an affiliated company must allocate the costs to the
appropriate administrative expense classifications as if the costs had been paid
directly by the MCO. The MCO may estimate these expense allocations based on a
formula or other reasonable basis and should use the method chosen consistently
from year to year, as applicable. Affiliated company management fees, or any
portion thereof, are not to be reported on Line 20 Other Expenses.

Line 20 Other Expenses Enter the total of all other expenses not specifically
identified in any of the above administrative expense classifications. Include
that portion of any non-affiliated management fees that are charged to the Texas
Medicaid operations, which are not allocable to Lines 1 through 18.
Non-affiliated company management fees, or any portion thereof, are not to be
reported on Line 19 Affiliate Company Allocations/Charges.

20.

Included in Total Administrative Above:
Line 22 Total Management Fees Enter the total management and/or other similar
fees, paid or payable to either affiliates and/or non-affiliates for the
management and/or administration of all or part of the MCO's operations. Refer
to Line 19 for allocation of affiliate management fees, and Line 20 for
allocation of non-affiliate management fees.

Line 23 Total Related Party Expenses Enter the total administrative expenses
paid or payable to any companies affiliated with the MCO through common
ownership for goods and/or services.

Line 24 Total Administrative Expenses Accrual Enter the total accrual for
administrative expenses payable for goods and services received but not paid for
as of the end of the period reported in the FSR. Accruals for administrative

Line 25 Allowable Pre-implementation Costs Enter the Pre-implementation Costs
that are allowable expenses to the initial contract period only, and are costs
incurred between signing the initial contract and the implementation date of the
contract.

These costs are excluded from Administrative Expenses, but are taken into
account in calculating the first contract period Experience Rebate. If the MCO
does not have a profit in the first contract period, these costs are a moot
point. If the MCO has a profit, the Pre-implementation Costs are subtracted from
the Net Income Before Taxes before applying the experience rebate calculations.
