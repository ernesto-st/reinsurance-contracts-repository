                                SERVICE AGREEMENT

         THIS AGREEMENT, effective as of the first day of January, 1999, by and
between Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company ("Phoenix"), a New York
mutual life insurance company with executive offices at One American Row,
Hartford, Connecticut and PXRE Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together
with its subsidiaries, collectively "PXRE").


                                    RECITALS:

         Phoenix currently performs certain accounting services (as described in
Article III, collectively the "Services") with respect to PXRE for the current
investment advisor (the "Advisor") for PXRE Reinsurance Company and
Transnational Reinsurance Company, both being subsidiaries of PXRE
(collectively, the "Subsidiaries"). By agreement among Phoenix, PXRE and such
advisor, Phoenix will henceforth provide the Services directly to PXRE.


                                 ARTICLE I: TERM

This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect through the close of
business on December 31, 2000, and shall automatically be renewed each year
thereafter for a one-year term unless either party shall have given the other at
least ninety (90) days' notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement at the
end of the then current term.


                            ARTICLE II: CONSIDERATION

A.    General. The consideration payable to Phoenix by PXRE shall be as set
      forth in Schedule II. PXRE shall also pay Phoenix any applicable state
      sales, use, service or similar taxes with respect to the Services.

B.    Amendments. On or before December 31 of each year, the parties shall affix
      a new Schedule II hereto to reflect all changes, if any, they have agreed
      upon or a confirmation that there will be no changes in the prior year's
      fees.


                              ARTICLE III: SERVICES

A.    Obligations of Phoenix.

      1.    General. Phoenix hereby agrees to provide the Services for the
            Subsidiaries. The Services shall consist of the functions described
            hereinafter.

      2.    Maintenance of Books and Records. Based on the data received from
            PXRE, its custodian (the "Custodian") and its Advisor, Phoenix shall
            develop and maintain appropriate accounting books and records
            reflecting that portion of PXRE's long and short-term bond and
            equity investment portfolio managed by the Advisor and all trades
            effected therein by the Advisor. In so doing, it shall reconcile
            data received from the Custodian with data received from the Advisor
            and PXRE, researching any differences with the assistance of the
            Advisor.

      3.    Reporting. Phoenix shall produce and provide PXRE with the reports
            and system files identified in Schedule III, at the frequency
            provided therein, but only insofar as such reports are based on that
            portion of PXRE's portfolio as is managed by the Advisor or on
            trades effected by the Advisor.

B.    Obligations of PXRE.

      1.    General. PXRE shall provide Phoenix, in a timely fashion, with all
            information, if any, in its possession or under its control which is
            reasonably required by Phoenix in order to perform its obligations
            hereunder. Such information shall be provided in a medium and format
            reasonably acceptable to Phoenix. When Phoenix reports any
            reconciliation problems to PXRE, PXRE shall promptly assist Phoenix
            in researching the cause of the discrepancy.

2.    Payments.

      (a)   Within fifteen (15) days of each calendar quarter end, Phoenix shall
            invoice PXRE for all sums incurred hereunder during the preceding
            quarter. Such invoice shall contain or be supplemented by a
            reasonable amount of supporting detail. PXRE shall remit all sums
            billed within fifteen (15) days of receipt of invoice, unless
            contesting them in good faith.

      (b)   Within thirty (30) days after December 31 of each year and after the
            date of termination of this Agreement, Phoenix shall invoice PXRE
            for any additional sums owed, or remit to PXRE any excess sums paid
            during the preceding Term. PXRE shall pay any additional sums
            invoiced within fifteen (15) days of receipt of invoice unless
            contesting them in good faith.

      (c)   No sums due hereunder shall be netted against sums owed by either
            party to the other under any other agreement, unless the parties
            shall otherwise agree.

C.    Interest. All sums owed hereunder which are more than thirty (30) days
      past due shall bear interest at a rate equal to the prime rate at Chase
      Manhattan Bank, N.A., as of the original due date, from the original due
      date until paid.


                          ARTICLE IV: STANDARD OF CARE

In carrying out their respective obligations hereunder, each of the parties
hereto shall use its best efforts to abide in all material respects with all
applicable laws. In addition, they shall take all reasonable efforts to preserve
each other's confidential and proprietary information.


                             ARTICLE V: TERMINATION
