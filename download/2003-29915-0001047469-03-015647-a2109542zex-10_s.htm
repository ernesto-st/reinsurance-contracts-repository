Company of America under the long term disability benefit plan under a Hampshire Chemical Corporation Health and Welfare Plan, then you are also eligible. Eligibility under the

Leave of Absence", for an Employee or group of Employees that is approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources during which an Employee who is not actively working for Dow may continue
coverage under the Plan. Benefit Protected Leaves of Absences automatically expire after three (3)&nbsp;months, or upon the Employee's return to active work with Dow, whichever occurs first. The
Vice President of Human Resources may renew a Benefit Protected Leave of Absence. Such renewal must be in writing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naming Your Beneficiary.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You designate your beneficiary on the Company-Paid Life Beneficiary Designation form,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may change your beneficiary whenever you choose by completing a beneficiary change form. Beneficiary changes are not effective until the date they are received and processed by the
Dow Benefits Center. You will receive written notification of your beneficiary change. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Options.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of your death, your beneficiary should contact the HR Service Center. The beneficiary on record
must complete and sign a claim form to receive benefits, and a <U>certified</U> death certificate must be provided to MetLife to disburse the life insurance proceeds. To
file&nbsp;a Claim for a Plan Benefit, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>see Claims Procedures Appendix</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of this SPD. There are several payment options available including lump sum,
money market and guaranteed interest. Your HR Service Center staff can inform your beneficiary of the selections available. MetLife can also provide assistance with payment options available. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dow pays the entire premium for the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. MetLife pays the benefits under an insurance policy. MetLife may combine the
experience for the policy with other policies held by Dow. This means that the costs of these coverages may be determined on a combined basis, and the costs accumulated from year to year. Favorable
experience under one or more coverages in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience on other coverages in the same year or offset unfavorable experience of coverages in prior years. Policy
dividends declared by MetLife for the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan are used to reduce Dow's cost for the coverage in the same and prior years. </FONT></P>

Insurance and Employee-Paid Life Insurance benefits </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help ease
financial and emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Employee-Paid Life Insurance. You
may receive an accelerated benefit of up to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5000 and maximum $250,000) of your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Employee-Paid Life Insurance if,
as a result of an injury or sickness you are diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from
the Dow Benefits Center and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

may obtain a beneficiary form from the Dow Intranet or the HR Service Center. If you do not designate a beneficiary, then the default beneficiary will be the same as the beneficiary on your
Company-Paid Life Insurance. If you are not eligible for Company-Paid Life Insurance, then the default beneficiary is the same as your beneficiary for Executive Split Dollar
Life Insurance. If you are not enrolled in the Executive Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan, then your default beneficiary is the same as your beneficiary for the 1X Life Insurance Benefit Portion under

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Payment Options.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of your death, your beneficiary should contact the HR Service Center. A

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan are not
combined for experience with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan in a particular year may
offset unfavorable experience in prior years. It is not anticipated that there will be any dividends declared for the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance
Plan based on the manner in which the insurer has determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>

to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 96-62 and 29 CFR Part&nbsp;2570, subpart B. [DOL Final Authorization Number 2001-17E (May&nbsp;14, 2001)]. Under
this arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco
will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will transfer its percentage of each
death benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be obligated to pay the full amount
of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the entire amount of the claim. Neither
MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Plan Description  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dependent Life Insurance provides coverage for your eligible family members at group rates. The benefits are insured by a group term life insurance policy
underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). MetLife pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim for
Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Eligibility  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular, Full-Time active or Less-Than-Full-Time active Salaried Employees of a Participating Employer are
eligible to insure eligible Dependents under this Plan. In addition, active regular, Full Time Bargained-For Employees whose collective bargaining unit and the Participating Employer have
agreed to this Plan, who are actively at work, are also eligible to insure eligible Dependents under this Plan. Eligible Employees on a family or medical leave of absence approved by Dow or a
Participating Employer are also eligible to insure eligible Dependents under this Plan. If both you and your Spouse/Domestic Partner are eligible Employees, each may insure the other, but only one of
you may insure your Dependent children. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are on a "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence", you are also eligible to insure your eligible Dependent. A "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence" is a leave of absence, designated as
such, for an Employee or group of Employees that is approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources during which an Employee who is not actively working for Dow may continue coverage
under the Plan. Benefit Protected Leaves of Absences automatically expire after three (3)&nbsp;months, or upon the Employee's return to active work with Dow, whichever occurs first. The Vice
President of Human Resources may renew a Benefit Protected Leave of Absence. Such renewal must be in writing. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may also be eligible to insure an eligible Dependent if you are approved by the Participating Employer for certain other leaves of absences. Check the Plan Document for more
information. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employee Contribution  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee pays for Dependent Life Insurance coverage. Your contribution, made through post tax payroll deductions, is based on the coverage option that you
choose. For coverage on your Spouse's/Domestic Partner's life, your contribution will also depend on whether your Spouse/Domestic Partner is a "non-tobacco-user". Your
Spouse/Domestic Partner is considered a "non-tobacco-user" by the Plan if your Spouse/Domestic Partner has not used a tobacco product in the last 12&nbsp;months. If your
Spouse/Domestic Partner quits using tobacco, your Spouse/Domestic Partner is considered a "non-tobacco-user" as of the first day of the month after your Spouse/Domestic Partner
completes 12
non-tobacco-using months. If your Spouse/Domestic Partner is a "non-tobacco-user", your Spouse/Domestic Partner is considered a tobacco-user as of the
first day your Spouse/Domestic Partner uses tobacco. A false or out-of-date statement regarding tobacco use may result in benefits not being paid. For your portion of the
monthly costs, refer to the Choices enrollment materials provided during annual enrollment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are on a Benefit Protected Leave of Absence, the Plan Administrator has the full discretion to make special administrative arrangements as are necessary, such as deferring
Employee contributions on a temporary basis during the leave of absence, and requiring the Employee to repay premiums when the Employee returns to work, or any other arrangements the Plan
Administrator deems appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Benefit Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Beneficiary Designation.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the beneficiary of your Dependent Life Insurance Plan. <U>This cannot be
changed.</U> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Payment.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should contact the HR Service Center to report a Dependent's death. A <U>certified</U> death certificate
must be provided to MetLife to disburse the life insurance proceeds. There are several payment options available including lump sum, money market and guaranteed interest. The HR Service Center staff
can inform you of the selections available. MetLife is also available to provide assistance with payment options. To file&nbsp;a claim, see </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Funding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan are not
combined for experience with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under this insurance coverage in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience in prior years. It is not
anticipated that there will be any dividends declared for the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan based on the manner in which the insurer has
determined the premium. </FONT></P>

ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, your Spouse/Domestic Partner must be covered for at least $10,000 from Dependent Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit of up
to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5000 and maximum $50,000) of Dependent Life if, as a result of an injury or sickness he or she is diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Your Legal Rights  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are a participant in the Company-Paid, Employee-Paid or Dependent Life Insurance Plans, you are entitled to certain rights and
protections under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This law requires that all Plan participants must be able to: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Examine,
without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, the Plan Documents and the latest annual reports filed with the
U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Obtain,
upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of the Plan Documents and Summary Plan Descriptions. The Administrator may charge a reasonable
fee for the copies.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Receive
a summary of each Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this summary
annual report. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for you and all other Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for operating an employee benefit plan. The people who
operate the Plans, called "fiduciaries" of the Plans, have a duty to act prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
one, including your employer or any other person, may discharge you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit, or from exercising
your rights under ERISA. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the
decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the legal rights described above. For instance, if you request materials from one of the Plans and do not receive them within
30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must
file&nbsp;a written appeal within the time period specified in the Plan's Claims Procedures. Failure to comply with the Plan's claims procedures may significantly jeopardize your rights to benefits.
If you are not satisfied with the final appellate decision, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within 120&nbsp;days from the
date of the Claims Administrator's or the Plan Administrator's final written decision (or the deadline the Claims Administrator or Plan Administrator had to notify you of a decision). Failure to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The court will decide who should pay court costs and
legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have
sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>You Must File&nbsp;a Claim in Accordance with These Claims Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Claim" is a <U>written</U> request by a claimant for a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan benefit</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or an </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility
Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There are two kinds of Claims: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claim for Plan Benefits</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a request for benefits covered under the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a kind of Claim. It is a request for a determination as to whether a claimant is eligible to be a
Participant or covered Dependent under the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
must follow the claims procedures for either </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS or CLAIMS FOR AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, whichever applies to
your situation. See page 22 for the procedures for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. See page 22 for procedures for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS.</I></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Who Will Decide Whether to Approve or Deny My Claim?  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dow Chemical Company will approve or deny a Claim for an Eligibility Determination. The initial determination is made by the Dow Benefits Center. If you
appeal, the appellate decision is made by the Director of Global Benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
will approve or deny a Claim for Plan Benefits. MetLife is the Claims Administrator for both the initial determination and (if there is an appeal), the appellate determination. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>An Authorized Representative May Act on Your Behalf  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Authorized Representative may submit a Claim on behalf of a Plan Participant. The Plan will recognize a person as a Plan Participant's "Authorized
Representative" if such person submits a notarized document signed by the Participant stating that the Authorized Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Participant. A court order
stating that a person is authorized to submit Claims on behalf of a Participant will also be recognized by the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Authority Of The Administrators And Your Rights Under ERISA  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrators have the full, complete, and final discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings of fact in order to carry out their
respective Claims decision-making responsibilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretations
and claims decisions by the Administrators are final and binding on Participants. If you are not satisfied with an Administrator's final appellate decision, you may
file&nbsp;a civil action against the Plan under s. 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so
within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Administrator's final written decision. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>
