Lender based on the information in the Rate Form and, provided the actual Coupon Rate would be at

Lender deems appropriate and without any obligation to use any information provided by Borrower.
If Lender is unable to determine a Cap Rate for a Mortgaged Property, Lender shall have the right,

Lender, in each case in an amount or, in relation to an Additional Mortgaged Property, with value
equal to that amount which Lender determines will cause the Coverage and LTV Tests to be satisfied.

Equivalents deposited to the Cash Collateral Account or the amount available under the Letter of

Principal Amount and a denominator equal to the actual outstanding principal amount of all of the
Advances. In the event such Borrower exercises either of the options set forth in clauses (A)&nbsp;or
(B)&nbsp;of this paragraph, Borrower shall execute and deliver a Cash Collateral Agreement. Lender
shall agree at the request of Borrower to exchange one type of Additional Collateral for another
type of Additional Collateral provided such other type of Additional Collateral is of equivalent
value and which meets the requirements of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to
the contrary, except for any Substitution Deposit delivered in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.07 (the

to the Additional Collateral) are not satisfied within one year after delivery of the Additional
Collateral, Borrower shall be required to prepay the Advances Outstanding in an amount determined
by Lender to cause the Coverage and LTV Tests to be satisfied, and the Lender may draw on such
Additional Collateral and use the monies to make such prepayment. Any Advances required to be
prepaid pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be selected by the Borrower and, in addition to
