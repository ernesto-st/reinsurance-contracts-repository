(a) The Administrative Agent or each relevant L/C Issuer, as applicable, shall determine the Exchange Rates as of each Valuation Date to be used for calculating Alternative Currency Equivalent and Dollar Equivalent amounts of Credit Extensions and amounts outstanding hereunder denominated in Alternative Currencies.  Such Exchange Rates shall become effective as of such Valuation Date and shall be the Exchange Rates employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Valuation Date to occur.  Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by the Borrower hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such currency as so determined by the Administrative Agent (or, where applicable, each relevant L/C Issuer) at the Exchange Rate as of any Valuation Date. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of Loans and Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Administrative Agent and each relevant L/C Issuer may at periodic intervals (no more frequently than monthly (for both the Administrative Agent and such relevant L/C Issuer), or more frequently during the continuance of an Event of Default) recalculate the aggregate exposure under such Loans and Letters of Credit to account for fluctuations in the Exchange Rate affecting the Alternative Currency in which any such Loans and/or Letters of Credit are denominated.  If, as a result of such recalculation (i) the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed an amount equal to 105% of the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect, the Borrower will prepay Revolving Credit Loans and, if necessary, Cash Collateralize or Backstop the outstanding amount of Letters of Credit in the amount necessary to eliminate the excess over the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect or (ii) the aggregate L/C Obligations exceeds an amount equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Borrower will repay Revolving Credit Loans and, if necessary, Cash Collateralize or Backstop the outstanding amount of Letters of Credit in the amount necessary to eliminate such excess over the Letter of Credit Sublimit. (c) Whenever in this Agreement in connection with a borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such borrowing, Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5 or a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent or each relevant L/C issuer, as the case may be. 69 </FONT></DIV>

(e) If at any time on or following the Closing Date all of the Participating Member States that had adopted the Euro as their lawful currency on or prior to the Closing Date cease to have the Euro as their lawful national currency unit, then the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders will negotiate in good faith to amend the Loan Documents to (a) follow any generally accepted conventions and market practice with respect to redenomination of obligations originally denominated in Euro and (b) otherwise appropriately reflect the change in currency. (f) If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be the Exchange Rate.  The obligation of each Loan Party in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the &#8220;Judgment Currency&#8221;) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement Currency&#8221;), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from such Loan Party in the Agreement Currency, such Loan Party each agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Loan Party (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03 with respect to any amount of Indebtedness or Investment in a currency other than Dollars, no Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of exchange occurring after the time such Lien, Indebtedness or Investment is incurred; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.08 shall otherwise apply to such Sections, including with respect to determining whether any Indebtedness or Investment may be incurred at any time under such Sections. (h) For purposes of determining compliance under the covenants herein, any amount in a currency other than Dollars will be converted to Dollars in a manner consistent with that used in calculating net income in the Borrower&#8217;s annual financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to apply to the determination of whether Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred hereunder (which shall be subject to clause (i) below). (i) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to extend, replace, refund, refinance, renew or defease other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or defeasance would cause the applicable restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or defeasance, such restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed or defeased plus accrued amounts, and any costs, fees and premiums paid in connection therewith. SECTION 1.09 Letter of Credit Amounts.  Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Letter of Credit Application related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases 70 </FONT></DIV>

(c) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that no Default, Event of Default or Specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Borrower, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or Specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into.

Each Term B Lender severally agrees to make to the Borrower (including by way of conversion) a single loan denominated in Dollars in a principal amount equal to such Term B Lender&#8217;s Term B Commitment on the Closing Date.  Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(a) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.  Term B Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loans, as further provided herein. (b) The Revolving Credit Borrowings.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, on and after the Closing Date, each Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to make (or cause its Applicable Lending Office to make) Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period for the Revolving Credit Facility in Dollars or in an Approved Currency in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that, after giving effect to the making of any Revolving Credit Loans, in no event shall the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect.  Within the limits of each Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(b), prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(b).

Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 12:00 noon Local Time (A) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Dollar-denominated Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, or any conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans (provided that, if such Dollar-denominated Borrowing is an initial Credit Extension of Term B Loans to be made on the Closing Date, notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon Local Time one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date) and (B) four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency and (ii) 12:00 noon Local Time on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof.  Except as provided in Section 2.03(c), each Borrowing of, or conversion to, Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof.  Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Term Borrowing, a Revolving Credit Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, (ii) in the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Approved Currency for the requested Borrowing, (iii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iv) the Class, currency and principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (v) in the case of Loans in Dollars, the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, (vi) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vii) the account of the Borrower to be credited with the proceeds of such Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice with respect to a Borrowing in Dollars or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation with respect to a Borrowing in Dollars, then the applicable Loans shall be made or continued as, or converted to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one (1) month (subject to the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221;).

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Eurocurrency Rate Loans or the applicable SOFR Loans. If the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation with respect to a Borrowing in an Alternative Currency, then it will be deemed to have requested a conversion or continuation for an Interest Period of one (1) month. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, as applicable, in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower and Lenders acknowledge and agree that any conversion or continuation of an existing Loan shall be deemed to be a continuation of that Loan with a converted interest rate methodology and not a new Loan. (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Appropriate Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation described in Section 2.02(a).  In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make (or cause its Applicable Lending Office to make) the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Principal Office not later than 1:00 p.m. Local Time for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and SOFR Loans, and 3:00 p.m. Local Time for Base Rate Loans on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice.  Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.01 and in the case of a Credit Extension after the Closing Date, Section 4.02, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings and second, to the Borrower as provided above. (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SOFR Loan, as applicable, unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.04 in connection therewith.  During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require that (i) no Loans may be converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Dollars or SOFR Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  The determination of the Eurocurrency Rate or SOFR Loans by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (e) Anything in clauses (a) through (d) above to the contrary notwithstanding, after giving effect to all Term Borrowings and Revolving Credit Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans and Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans and Revolving Credit Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than twenty (20) Interest Periods in effect at any time for all Borrowings of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans plus up to three (3) additional Interest Periods in respect of each Incremental Facility. (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 75 </FONT></DIV>

If requested by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the L/C Issuer&#8217;s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request. (ii) The Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with a copy of any Letter of Credit Application.  Upon receipt by the relevant L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, acquire from the relevant L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the Revolving Credit Facility times the amount of such Letter of Credit. (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the relevant L/C Issuer shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an &#8220;Auto-Extension Letter of Credit&#8221;); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the relevant L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the &#8220;Non-extension Notice Date&#8221;) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the relevant L/C Issuer for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the applicable Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Facility Expiration Date; provided that the relevant L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the relevant L/C Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice on or before the day that is five (5) Business Days before the Non-extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable, or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied. (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the relevant L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any compliant drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall notify promptly the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  On the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which the Borrower shall have received notice of any payment by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice later than 1:00 p.m. Local Time on any Business Day, on the second succeeding Business Day) (such date of payment, an &#8220;Honor Date&#8221;), the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing (which reimbursement, in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, shall be in such Alternative Currency).  If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer on the Honor Date (or if any such reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason), then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable L/C Issuer and each Appropriate Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the &#8220;Unreimbursed Amount&#8221;), and the amount of such Appropriate Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage thereof.  In the event that the Borrower does not reimburse the L/C Issuer on the Business Day following the date it receives notice of the Honor Date (or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice later than 1:00 p.m. Local Time on any Business Day, on the second succeeding Business Day), the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested, for the account of the Borrower, a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (in the case of any Unreimbursed Amount in respect 78 </FONT></DIV>

For the avoidance of doubt, if any drawing occurs under a Letter of Credit and such drawing is not reimbursed on the same day as the day on which it is paid, such drawing shall, without duplication, accrue interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as applicable, under the Revolving Credit Facility until the date of reimbursement. (ii) Each Revolving Credit Lender of the applicable Class (including any such Lender acting as an L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Principal Office for payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a relevant Letter of Credit not later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan (or, in the case of any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan with an interest period of one month denominated in such Alternative Currency) to the Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the relevant L/C Issuer in accordance with the instructions provided to the Administrative Agent by such L/C Issuer (which instructions may include standing payment instructions, which may be updated from time to time by such L/C Issuer, provided that, unless the Administrative Agent shall otherwise agree, any such update shall not take effect until the Business Day immediately following the date on which such update is provided to the Administrative Agent). (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a Letter of Credit that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing for any reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in Dollars (with respect to a Dollar-denominated Letter of Credit) or in Alternative Currency (with respective to an Alternative Currency denominated Letter of Credit), in each case in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility or Eurocurrency Rate Loans with an interest period of one month under the Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable.  In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s payment under the Revolving Credit Facility to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. (iv) Until each Revolving Credit Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility funds its Revolving Credit Loan under the Revolving Credit Facility or relevant L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any relevant Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer. (v) Each Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or relevant L/C Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under relevant Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, and shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any relevant Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 79 </FONT></DIV>

(viii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender of the applicable Class shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

(e) Role of L/C Issuers.  Each Lender and the Borrower agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.

The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower&#8217;s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 2.03(e); provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower caused by such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of documents strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit (in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable decision).  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

In addition to any other provision under this Agreement requiring Cash Collateral to be provided, (i) if the relevant L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing for reasons other than the failure of a Revolving Credit Lender to fulfill its obligations under clause (c)(ii) above, (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Facility Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) if any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize or Backstop the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02(c) or (iv) an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) or (g) occurs and is continuing, then the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize or Backstop the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount plus any accrued or unpaid fees thereon determined as of the date such Cash Collateral is provided).

The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account for the benefit of the Borrower.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in accounts satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents at its sole discretion. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is less than the L/C Exposure, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the deposit accounts specified by the Administrative Agent, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such L/C Exposure over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim.  Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer.  To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the L/C Exposure plus costs incidental thereto and so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower.  If such Event of Default is cured or waived and no other Event of Default is then occurring and continuing, the amount of any Cash Collateral (including any accrued interest thereon) shall be refunded to the Borrower. (g) Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a relevant Letter of Credit fee for each relevant Letter of Credit issued on its behalf pursuant to this Agreement equal to the product of (i) the Applicable Rate for relevant Letter of Credit fees and (ii) the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  Such letter of credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Facility Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. (h) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers.  The Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee (a &#8220;Fronting Fee&#8221;) in Dollars with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer in an amount to be agreed between the Borrower and such L/C Issuer (but in any case, not to exceed 0.125% per annum) of the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  Such Fronting Fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such Fronting Fees shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Facility Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.  Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable within ten (10) Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable. (i) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application.  Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in any Letter of Credit Application, in the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control. (j) Addition of an L/C Issuer.  A Revolving Credit Lender (or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates) under the Revolving Credit Facility may become an additional L/C Issuer hereunder pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Revolving Credit Lender.

Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans made by the Lenders other than the Swingline Lender shall be immediately delivered by the Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender (and not to the Borrower) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the applicable Refunded Swingline Loans and (2) on the day such Revolving Credit Loans are made, the Swingline Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the Refunded Swingline Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Credit Loan made by the Swingline Lender to the Borrower, and such portion of the Swingline Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swingline Loans but shall instead constitute part of the Swingline Lender&#8217;s outstanding Revolving Credit Loans.  If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to the Swingline Lender should be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from the Swingline Lender in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Revolving Credit Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.13. (ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i) in an amount sufficient to repay any amounts owed to the Swingline Lender in respect of any outstanding Swingline Loans on or before the third Business Day after demand for payment thereof by the Swingline Lender, each of the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have purchased, and hereby agrees to purchase, a participation in such outstanding Swingline Loans in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the applicable unpaid amount together with accrued interest thereon.  Upon one (1) Business Days&#8217; notice from the Swingline Lender, each Revolving Credit Lender shall deliver to the Swingline Lender an amount equal to its respective participation in the applicable unpaid amount in same day funds at the Principal Office of the Swingline Lender.  In order to evidence such participation, each such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to enter into a participation agreement at the request of the Swingline Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Swingline Lender. (iii) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(ii), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Swingline Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be.  A certificate of a Swingline Lender submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (iv) Each Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person 84 </FONT></DIV>

The Discounted Prepayment Option Notice shall further specify with respect to the proposed Discounted Voluntary Prepayment (A) the Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount for Loans to be prepaid, (B) a discount range (which may be a single percentage) selected by the Borrower with respect to such proposed Discounted Voluntary Prepayment equal to a percentage of par of the principal amount of the Loans to be prepaid (the &#8220;Discount Range&#8221;), and (C) the date by which Lenders are required to indicate their election to participate in such proposed Discounted Voluntary Prepayment, which shall be at least five (5) Business Days from and including the date of the Discounted Prepayment Option Notice (the &#8220;Acceptance Date&#8221;). (iii) Upon receipt of a Discounted Prepayment Option Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender thereof.  On or prior to the Acceptance Date, each such Lender may specify by written notice substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto (each, a &#8220;Lender Participation Notice&#8221;) to the Administrative Agent (A) a maximum discount to par (the &#8220;Acceptable Discount&#8221;) within the Discount Range (for example, a Lender specifying a discount to par of 20% would accept a purchase price of 80% of the par value of the Loans to be prepaid) and (B) a maximum principal amount (subject to rounding requirements specified by the Administrative Agent) of the Term Loans to be prepaid held by such Lender with respect to which such Lender is willing to permit a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment at the Acceptable Discount (&#8220;Offered Loans&#8221;).  Based on the Acceptable Discounts and principal amounts of the Term Loans to be prepaid specified by the Lenders in the applicable Lender Participation Notice, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, shall determine the applicable discount for such Term Loans to be prepaid (the &#8220;Applicable Discount&#8221;), which Applicable Discount shall be (A) the percentage specified by the Borrower if the Borrower has selected a single percentage pursuant to Section 2.05(d)(ii)) for the Discounted Voluntary Prepayment or (B) otherwise, the highest Acceptable Discount at which the Borrower can pay the Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount in full (determined by adding the Outstanding Amount of Offered Loans commencing with the Offered Loans with the highest Acceptable Discount); provided, however, that in the event that such Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount cannot be repaid in full at any Acceptable Discount, the Applicable Discount shall be the lowest Acceptable Discount specified by the Lenders that is within the Discount Range.  The Applicable Discount shall be applicable for all Lenders who have offered to participate in the Discounted Voluntary Prepayment and have Qualifying Loans.  Any Lender with outstanding Term Loans to be prepaid whose Lender Participation Notice is not received by the Administrative Agent by the Acceptance Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment of any of its Loans at any discount to their par value within the Applicable Discount. (iv) The Borrower shall make a Discounted Voluntary Prepayment by prepaying those Term Loans to be prepaid (or the respective portions thereof) offered by the Lenders (&#8220;Qualifying Lenders&#8221;) that specify an Acceptable Discount that is equal to or greater than the Applicable Discount (&#8220;Qualifying Loans&#8221;) at the Applicable Discount, provided that if the aggregate proceeds required to prepay all Qualifying Loans (disregarding any interest payable at such time) would exceed the amount of aggregate proceeds required to prepay the Proposed Discounted Prepayment Amount, such amounts in each case calculated by applying the Applicable Discount, the Borrower shall prepay such Qualifying Loans ratably among the Qualifying Lenders based on their respective principal amounts of such Qualifying Loans (subject to rounding requirements specified by the Administrative Agent).  If the aggregate proceeds required to prepay all Qualifying Loans (disregarding any interest payable at such time) would be less than the amount of aggregate proceeds required to prepay the Proposed Discounted 90 </FONT></DIV>

Any voluntary prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be applied between Classes of Term Loans as directed by the Borrower or, if the Borrower does not so direct any voluntary prepayment to a specific Class of Term Loans at the time of such prepayment, such prepayment shall be applied to prepay the Term Loans on a pro rata basis across Classes. Any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be applied to the Term B Loans on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms hereof and, except to the extent required pursuant to the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment or Extension Offer with respect to any applicable Class of Incremental Term Loans or Extended Term Loans, any prepayment of any Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05 may be applied to any Class of Term Loans as directed by the Borrower, which prepayment may not be directed towards a later maturing Class of Term Loans without at least a pro rata repayment of any earlier maturity Class of Term Loans.  Each prepayment of any Class of Term Loans shall be paid to the Lenders of such Class in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages subject to clause (v) of Section 2.05(b). 91 </FONT></DIV>

The amount of any such Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit unless, after giving effect to any reduction of the Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit, as the case may be, exceeds the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, in which case such sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may rescind or postpone any notice of termination of the Commitments if such termination would have resulted from a refinancing, which refinancing shall not be consummated or otherwise shall be delayed.

All Commitment Fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. SECTION 2.07 Repayment of Loans.

SECTION 2.08 Interest. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate, (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate and (iii) each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Revolving Credit Loans and (iv) each SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to Adjusted Term SOFR therefor plus the Applicable Rate.

Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) and disclosure thereunder, whenever any interest or any fee to be paid hereunder or in connection herewith is to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day or 365-day year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate used in such calculation is equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by 360 or 365, as applicable.  The rates of interest under this Agreement are nominal rates, and not effective rates or yields.  The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this Agreement. SECTION 2.11 Evidence of Indebtedness. (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by one or more entries in the Register.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loan Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender or its registered assigns, which shall evidence such Lender&#8217;s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, entries in the Register, evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit.  In the event of any conflict between the Register and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. SECTION 2.12 Payments Generally. (a) All payments by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made (i) with respect to the Term B Loans and Swingline Loans, in Dollars, and (ii) with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitments and Letters of Credit, in the applicable Approved Currency in which such Obligations are denominated, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m., Local Time, shall (in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent) be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Other than as specified herein, all payments under each Loan Document of principal or interest in respect of any Loan (or of any breakage indemnity in respect of any Loan) shall be made in Dollars. (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 94 </FONT></DIV>

If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lenders in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lenders to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (x) in the case of Revolving Credit Loans, at the Overnight Rate, and (y) in the case of SOFR Loans, the Federal Funds Rate, in each case, plus, to the extent reasonably requested in writing by the Administrative Agent, any administrative, processing or similar fees to the extent customarily charged by such Administrative Agent to generally similarly situated borrowers (but not necessarily all such borrowers) in connection with the foregoing; it being understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder; and (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Compensation Period&#8221;) (x) in the case of Revolving Credit Loans, at the Overnight Rate, and (y) in the case of SOFR Loans, the Federal Funds Rate, in each case, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing plus, to the extent reasonably requested in writing by the Administrative Agent, any administrative, processing or similar fees to the extent customarily charged by such Administrative Agent to generally similarly situated borrowers (but not necessarily all such borrowers) in connection with the foregoing.  When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing.  If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at the interest rate applicable to such Loan.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent demonstrable error. (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make its payment under Section 9.07 are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.07. 95 </FONT></DIV>

The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of demonstrable error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.

(b) In addition, and without duplication of any obligation set forth in Section 3.01(a), the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (c) Without duplication of any amounts paid pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b), the Borrower shall jointly and severally indemnify each Agent and each Lender within ten (10) days of receipt of a written demand thereof for (i) the full amount of Indemnified Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction in respect of amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Agent and such Lender and (ii) any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. (b) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan: (i) Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be made in good faith and be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or (ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or electronic means as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (which notice shall be promptly given by the Administrative Agent when such circumstances no longer exist), (i) any Committed Loan Notice that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Committed Loan Notice requests a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, such Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Loan; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.01, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders of each Class stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.  Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (b) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 3.02(b), only to the extent the screen page for such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), (x) any Committed Loan Notice that requests the conversion of any Revolving Credit Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Credit Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be ineffective and (y) if any Committed Loan Notice requests a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, such Borrowing shall be made as an Base Rate Loan and (z) any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing shall be ineffective. The interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined by reference to LIBOR, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth in this Section 3.02 of this Agreement, such Section 3.02 provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower, pursuant to this Section 3.02, in advance of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and each L/C Issuer do not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the CDOR Rate, London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of &#8220;Eurocurrency Rate,&#8221; &#8220;LIBOR&#8221; or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.02, will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, Eurocurrency Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. (2) With respect to the Term Loans: Subject to Section 3.02, if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any SOFR Loan: (a) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that &#8220;Adjusted Term SOFR&#8221; cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or (b)  Term Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of such Class determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Term Lenders of making and maintaining such Term Loan, and Term Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of such Class have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each case, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Term Lender. Upon written notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Term Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to SOFR 109 </FONT></DIV>

Upon receipt of such written notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period.  Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.03.

(b) If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender&#8217;s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, and such Lender&#8217;s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.05), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such demand.

In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  The provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of, and among the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and each L/C Issuer, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall be bound by or have rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions (except to the extent such rights are set forth herein, including with respect to such rights in Section 9.09).

No Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that such Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its judgment or the judgment of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law.  No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(a) Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, request, consent, certificate, instrument, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a result of such Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from acting hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance). (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.

SECTION 9.05 Notice of Default.  None of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower 161 </FONT></DIV>

Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, the Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to any Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article VIII; provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders. SECTION 9.06 Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agents.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower and the other Loan Parties hereunder. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide (and shall not be liable for the failure to provide) any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person. SECTION 9.07 Indemnification of Agents.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it in its capacity as an Agent-Related Person; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Agent-Related Person&#8217;s own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 9.07.  In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.07 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower, provided that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrower&#8217;s continuing reimbursement obligations with respect thereto, if any.  The undertaking in this Section 9.07 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Loan Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. SECTION 9.08 Agents in their Individual Capacities.

SECTION 9.09 Successor Agents.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may resign as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, as applicable, upon thirty (30) days&#8217; notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.  If the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States, which appointment of a successor agent shall require the consent of the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default under Section 8.01(f) or (g) (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, which successor may not be a Defaulting Lender or Disqualified Lender.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221; or &#8220;Collateral Agent,&#8221; as applicable, shall mean such successor administrative agent and/or supplemental administrative agent, as the case may be, and the term &#8220;Collateral Agent&#8221; shall mean such successor collateral agent and/or supplemental agent, as described in Section 9.01(c), and the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s or retiring Collateral Agent&#8217;s, as applicable, appointment, powers and duties as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated.  After the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s or retiring Collateral Agent&#8217;s resignation, as applicable, hereunder as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the provisions of this Article IX and Section 10.04 and Section 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, under this Agreement.  If no successor agent has accepted appointment as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed).  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may reasonably request, in order to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement is satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent shall, to the extent not previously discharged, be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent or the successor Collateral Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s or retiring Collateral Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent or retiring Collateral Agent, as applicable, and its agents and sub-agents in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent or retiring Collateral Agent, as applicable, was acting as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable. 163 </FONT></DIV>

SECTION 9.14 Withholding Tax.  To the extent required by any applicable Law (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties, additions to Tax or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.14.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Cash Management Obligations or Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.  Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank shall indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each of its directors, officers, employees, or agents, to the extent not reimbursed by the Loan Parties, against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Agent or its directors, officers, employees, or agents in connection with such provider&#8217;s Cash Management Obligations or Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements; provided, however, that no Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Agent&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.  No Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank will create (or be deemed to create) in favor of any such provider, as applicable, any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Guarantor under the Loan Documents.  By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each such Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank shall be deemed to have appointed the Collateral Agent as its agent and agreed to be bound by the Loan Documents as a Secured Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.15.

The agreements in this Section 10.05 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Loan Documents, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.05 shall not apply to Taxes other than Taxes that represent liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, etc., with respect to a non-Tax claim.

SECTION 10.06 Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to any Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or any Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by any Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.  The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 10.07(e) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 176 </FONT></DIV>

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties intend and shall treat the Loans (and any participation made pursuant to Section 10.07(e)) as being at all times maintained in &#8220;registered form&#8221; within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is an Affiliated Lender.  The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent, acting in its capacity as a non-fiduciary agent for purposes of maintaining the Register, and its officers, directors, employees, agents, sub-agents and affiliates, shall constitute &#8220;Indemnitees&#8221; under Section 10.05 hereof. (e) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or a Defaulting Lender) (each, a &#8220;Participant&#8221;) in all or a portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender&#8217;s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any 178 </FONT></DIV>

Subject to Section 10.07(f), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.03 and 3.04 (through the applicable Lender), subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections (including Section 3.01(f) and Sections 3.05 and 3.06), to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(b) (it being agreed that any documentation required to be provided under Section 3.01(f) shall be provided solely to the participating Lender).  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant complies with Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.  Any Lender that sells participations and any Lender that grants a Loan to a SPC shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and the address of each Participant and/or SPC and the principal and interest amounts of each Participant&#8217;s and/or SPC&#8217;s participation interest in the Commitments and/or Loans (or other rights or obligations) held by it (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;).  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, absent demonstrable error, and the Borrower and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation interest or granted Loan as the owner thereof for all purposes notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent, acting in its capacity as a non-fiduciary agent for purposes of maintaining the Participant Register, and its officers, directors, employees, agents, sub-agents and affiliates, shall constitute &#8220;Indemnitees&#8221; under Section 10.05 hereof.  In maintaining the Participant Register, such Lender shall be acting as the non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower solely for purposes of applicable U.S. federal income tax law and undertakes no duty, responsibility or obligation to the Borrower (without limitation, in no event shall such Lender be a fiduciary of the Borrower for any purpose). No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish in connection with a Tax audit that such commitment, loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-5(b) of the Proposed Treasury Regulations (or any amended or successor version) or, if different, under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.03 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent or to the extent such entitlement to a greater payment results from a Change in Law after the Participant became a Participant. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or similar central bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an &#8220;SPC&#8221;) the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) an SPC shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.01, 3.03 and 3.04, subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections (including Section 3.01(f) and Sections 3.05 and 3.06), to the same extent as if such SPC were a Lender, but neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.01, 3.03 or 3.04) except to the extent any entitlement to greater amounts results from a Change in Law after the grant to the SPC occurred, (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable and such liability shall remain with the Granting Lender, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made 179 </FONT></DIV>

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (1) any Lender may in accordance with applicable Law create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it and (2) any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities; provided that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

In the event of any such resignation of an L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders willing to accept such appointment a successor L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, hereunder; provided that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the relevant L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be.  If an L/C Issuer resigns as an L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender resigns as Swingline Lender, as the case may be, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans (as the case may be) outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto and obligations with respect to the Swingline Loans, as applicable (including, as applicable, the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in the Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.04).  Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges an duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as applicable, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of such L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.

SECTION 10.25 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.  To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221;, and each such QFC, a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
