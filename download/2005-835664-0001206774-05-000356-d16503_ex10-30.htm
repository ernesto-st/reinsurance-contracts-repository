exceeding, such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of the Maximum Loan Availability (but in no event in excess of such
Lender&#146;s Commitment).  Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions of this

deliver to the Agent a Notice of Borrowing or, if the borrowing is to be made in connection with a Continuation

principal amount of the Revolving Loans to be borrowed, the date such Revolving Loans are to be borrowed (which
must be a Business Day), the use of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans, the Type of the requested Revolving
Loans, and if such Revolving Loans are to be LIBOR Loans, the initial Interest Period for such Revolving Loans.
Each Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion shall be irrevocable once given and binding on the
Borrower.  Prior to delivering a Notice of Borrowing, the Borrower may (without specifying whether a Revolving
Loan will be a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan) request that the Agent provide the Borrower with the most recent
LIBOR available to the Agent.  The Agent shall provide such quoted rate to the Borrower and to the Lenders on the

behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), request a
borrowing of Base Rate Loans from the Lenders in an amount equal to the principal balance of such Swingline
Loan.  The amount limitations contained in the second sentence of Section 2.1. shall not apply to any borrowing
of Base Rate Loans made pursuant to this subsection.  The Swingline Lender shall give notice to the Agent of any
such borrowing of Base Rate Loans not later than 9:00 a.m. San Francisco time at least one Business Day prior to
the proposed date of such borrowing.  Not later than 9:00 a.m. San Francisco time on the proposed date of such
borrowing, each Lender will make available to the Agent at the Principal Office for the account of the Swingline
Lender, in immediately available funds, the proceeds of the Base Rate Loan to be made by such Lender.  The Agent
shall pay the proceeds of such Base Rate Loans to the Swingline Lender, which shall apply such proceeds to repay
such Swingline Loan.  If the Lenders are prohibited from making Loans required to be made under this subsection
for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, the occurrence of any of the Defaults or Events of
Default described in Sections 11.1.(e) or (f), each Lender shall purchase from the Swingline Lender, without
recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share
of such Swingline Loan, by directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline Loan in such amount and paying
the proceeds thereof to the Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender in Dollars and in immediately available
funds.  A Lender&#146;s obligation to purchase such a participation in a Swingline Loan shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) any
claim of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any other Person may have
or claim against the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Person whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or
continuation of a Default or Event of Default (including without limitation, any of the Defaults or Events of
Default described in Sections 11.1. (e) or (f)), or the termination of any Lender&#146;s Commitment, (iii) the
existence (or alleged existence) of an event or condition which has had or could have a Material Adverse Effect,
(iv) any breach of any Loan Document by the Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or (v) any
other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  If such
amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be
entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for each day
from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
upon the Swingline Lender&#146;s demand therefor, and until such time as such Lender makes the required payment,
the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid
participation obligation for all purposes of the Loan Documents (other than those provisions requiring the other
Lenders to purchase a participation therein).  Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all
payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, and any other amounts due it hereunder, to the Swingline
Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to
purchase pursuant to this Section until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or
otherwise).

Provisions, the maximum Obligations for which such Borrower shall be liable hereunder shall be reduced to that

<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders, if expressly required
hereunder) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation, if any, of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon
demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel to the Agent) incurred by the Agent in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice with
respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents
and/or collect any Obligations, any &#147;lender liability&#148; suit or claim brought against the Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the
Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws.  Such out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of
the Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Agent that the Agent
will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The
agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the termination of this
Agreement.  If the Borrower shall reimburse the Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount
pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.
