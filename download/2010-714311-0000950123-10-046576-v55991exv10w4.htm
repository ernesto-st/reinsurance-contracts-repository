rendered by a federal or state court sitting in the State of New York are denominated in
U.S. Dollars; under the laws of the State of New York, however, where a cause of action is

Collateral constituting &#147;payment intangibles&#148;, &#147;general intangibles&#148; or &#147;accounts&#148; (as such
terms are defined in Article&nbsp;9 of the NYUCC) may be subject to the rights, claims and

of any Collateral which is itself secured by other property, we express no opinion with
respect to the Collateral Agent&#146;s rights in and to such underlying property.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(p) Our opinion set forth in paragraph 4 above is subject to the further qualification
that: (i)&nbsp;in the case of proceeds, the Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest is limited as
provided in Sections&nbsp;9-315 and 9-322 of the NYUCC; and (ii)&nbsp;Section&nbsp;552 of the Bankruptcy
Code limits (subject to the exceptions set forth therein) the extent to which property
acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code may be
subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by the debtor
before the commencement of such case.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r) In the case of Collateral in which the security interest of the Collateral Agent
has been perfected by the filing of a Financing Statement, Article&nbsp;9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code requires the filing of continuation statements within the period of six
months prior to the expiration of five years from the date of the original filings in order
to maintain the effectiveness of such filings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(s) The perfection of the Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest will be terminated as to
any Collateral acquired by an Obligor more than four months after such Obligor so changes
its name as to make the Financing Statement filed in respect of such Obligor seriously
misleading, unless an amendment to such Financing Statement indicating the new name of the
relevant entity is properly filed before the expiration of such four months.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(t) If any Obligor changes its jurisdiction of organization to a new jurisdiction, the
Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest in certain of the Collateral will terminate four months
after such change (or, if earlier, when perfection would have ceased under the law of the
former jurisdiction), unless such security interest is perfected in such new jurisdiction
before termination.

under the laws of the State of California.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;CA Subsidiary Holdco has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents. The execution, delivery and
performance by the CA Subsidiary Holdco of the Transaction Documents has been duly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of the CA Subsidiary Holdco.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents, does not, and the performance by
the CA Subsidiary Holdco of its obligations thereunder, each in accordance with its terms, do not
(a)&nbsp;conflict with the CA Subsidiary Holdco&#146;s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, (b)&nbsp;contravene
any provision of any Applicable Law, (c)&nbsp;constitute a violation of or a default under any
Applicable Contract or (d)&nbsp;result in or cause the creation of any security interest or lien upon
any of the property of an CA Subsidiary Holdco pursuant to any Applicable Contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;No Governmental Approval, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and
effect, is required to authorize or is required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance of Transaction Documents to which it is a party, each in accordance with its terms, by
the CA Subsidiary Holdco.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;In any proceedings duly taken in the courts of the State of California or a United States
federal court sitting in the State of California to enforce any of the Transaction Documents, the
choice of New York law as the substantive law governing such Transaction Documents should be
recognized and such law should be applied except as may otherwise be provided under the Transaction
Documents and the California Uniform Commercial Code, including the California Uniform Commercial
Code Sections&nbsp;9-301 to 9-307. The foregoing assumes that the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents bear a reasonable relationship to the State of New York and that the
application of New York law would not result in a violation of a fundamental public policy of the
State of California.
