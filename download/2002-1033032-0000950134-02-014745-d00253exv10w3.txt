effectiveness of this Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 10 and Section 11 on or before May 31, 2002.
Until such time as the Banks determine that the conditions set forth in Section
10 and Section 11 have been satisfied, all of the Borrower's rights shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the terms and


<PAGE>
                                       29


conditions of the Original Agreement, as modified by the Forbearance Agreement.
If the conditions set forth in Section 10 and Section 11 are not satisfied on or
before May 31, 2002, then this Agreement, and the respective rights and
obligations of the parties hereto, shall be null and void AB INITIO and of no
further force and effect and the respective rights and obligations of the
Borrower, the Agent and the Banks shall be governed by the terms and conditions
of the Original Agreement, as modified by the Forbearance Agreement.

         (e) Suspension of Loans. If any stay, order, cease and desist order,
injunction, temporary restraining order or similar judicial or nonjudicial
sanction shall be issued limiting or otherwise materially adversely affecting
any Timeshare Interest sales activities, other business operations in respect of
the Eligible Projects, or the enforcement of the remedies of the Agent and the
Banks hereunder or under the Security Documents, then, in such event, the Agent
and the Banks shall have no obligation to make any Loans hereunder: (i) in
respect of Eligible Consumer Loans from the sale of Timeshare Interests which
are the subject of any stay, order, cease and desist order, injunction,
temporary restraining order or similar judicial or nonjudicial sanction until
the stay, order, cease and desist order, injunction, temporary restraining order
or similar judicial or nonjudicial sanction has been lifted or released to the
satisfaction of the Required Banks and (ii) in respect of consumer loans from
the sale of Timeshare Interests at any Eligible Project if: (x) the stay, order,
cease and desist order, injunction, temporary restraining order or similar
judicial or nonjudicial sanction in question has not been lifted or released to
the satisfaction of the Required Banks within sixty (60) days of its issuance
and (y) there is a reduction in the total number of sales of Timeshare Interests
by the Borrower in any Loan Year of more than twenty percent (20%) from the
total number of sales of Timeshare Interests in the immediately preceding Loan
Year.

         (f) Change in Control. If there shall occur a change, singly or in the
aggregate, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the executive management of the
Borrower as described in SCHEDULE 2.1(f), the Banks shall have no obligation to
make any Loans hereunder, unless within thirty (30) days prior thereto the
Borrower provides the Banks with written information setting forth the
replacement executive management personnel of the Borrower together with a
description of those Persons' experience, ability and reputation, and the
Required Banks, acting in good faith, determine that the replacement management
personnel's experience, ability and reputation is equal to or greater than that
of the Borrower as set forth on SCHEDULE 2.1(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the makeup of the Borrower's Board of Directors may be altered in accordance
with the Bond Holder Exchange Documents, provided that no more than two (2) of
the five (5) positions shall be controlled by the holders of the New Notes.

         (g) Failure to Adhere to Business Plan/Default or Event of Default. The
Agent and the Banks shall not be obligated to fund any Loan hereunder if: (i)
the Borrower shall fail to substantially adhere to the Business Plan (including
the Senior Lender Advance Schedule) as determined by the Required Banks in their
sole and absolute discretion or (ii) a Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing.

                                       30


         2.2. MANDATORY AUTOMATIC REDUCTION OF TRANCHE B TOTAL COMMITMENT. The
Tranche B Total Commitment shall be reduced automatically on a monthly basis as
of the first day of each calendar month based on a twenty (20) year amortization
schedule to an amount equal to or less than the amount set forth on SCHEDULE
2.2. Upon each such reduction, the Tranche B Commitments of each of the Tranche
B Banks shall be reduced pro rata in accordance with its Tranche A Commitment
Percentage and the Borrower shall make any prepayments required by Section
3.2(b) hereof. No reduction of the Tranche B Commitments may be reinstated.

         2.3. THE NOTES. The Tranche A Loans shall be evidenced by separate
promissory notes of the Borrower in substantially the form of EXHIBIT B hereto
(each a "TRANCHE A NOTE"). The Tranche B Loans shall be evidenced by separate
promissory notes of the Borrower in substantially the form of EXHIBIT C hereto
(each a "TRANCHE B Note"). Each of the Tranche A Notes and the Tranche B Notes
shall be dated as of the Closing Date and completed with appropriate insertions.
One Tranche A Note shall be payable to the order of each Tranche A Bank in a
principal amount equal to such Bank's Tranche A Commitment or, if less, the
outstanding amount of all Tranche A Loans made by such Bank, plus interest
accrued thereon, as set forth below. One Tranche B Note shall be payable to the
order of each Tranche B Bank in a principal amount equal to such Bank's Tranche
B Commitment or, if less, the outstanding amount of all Tranche B Loans made by
such Tranche B Bank, plus interest accrued thereon, as set forth below. The
Borrower irrevocably authorizes each Bank to make or cause to be made, at or
about the time of the Drawdown Date of any Loan or at the time of receipt of any
payment of principal on such Bank's Note, an appropriate notation on such Bank's
Note Record reflecting the making of such Loan or (as the case may be) the
receipt of such payment. The outstanding amount of the Loans set forth on such
Bank's Note record shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof
owing and unpaid to such Bank, but the failure to record, or any error in so
recording, any such amount on such Bank's Note Record shall not limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any Note to
make payments of principal of or interest on any Note when due.

         2.4. INTEREST ON LOANS. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.7,
(a) each Tranche A Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the
Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the date such Loan is repaid at a rate per
annum equal to the Base Rate and (b) each Tranche B Loan shall bear interest for
the period commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the date such
Loan is repaid at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. The Borrower
promises to pay interest on each Loan monthly in arrears on the first day of
each calendar month for the prior calendar month.

         2.5. REQUESTS FOR LOANS. The Borrower shall give to the Agent written
notice in the form of EXHIBIT D hereto (or telephonic notice confirmed in a
writing in the form of EXHIBIT D hereto) of each Loan requested hereunder (a
"LOAN REQUEST") no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed
Drawdown Date of any Loan. Each such notice shall specify (i) the principal
amount of the Tranche A Loan or Tranche B Loan requested and (ii) the proposed
Drawdown Date


<PAGE>
                                       31


of such Loan. Each Loan Request for a Tranche A Loan shall be accompanied by a
Borrowing Base Certificate. With each Loan Request for a Tranche A Loan, the
Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the Required Consumer Loan Documents for the
Eligible Consumer Loans to be pledged by the Borrower to the Agent and upon
which such Loan Request is based so that the Borrowing Base shall exceed the
outstanding amount of all Tranche A Loans (including the Tranche A Loans
included in such Loan Request). By submitting a Loan Request, the Borrower shall
be deemed to represent and warrant that (i) with respect to a Loan Request for a
Tranche A Loan, the information in the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate
remains true and accurate as of the date of such Loan Request, (ii) the proceeds
of such Loan shall be used by the Borrower in accordance with Section 6.19.1 and
the Business Plan, and (iii) that after giving effect to the requested advance,
the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Loans will not exceed the
lesser of the Tranche A Total Commitment and the Borrowing Base and the
outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Loans will not exceed the Tranche
B Total Commitment. Promptly upon receipt of any such notice, the Agent shall
notify each of the Tranche A Banks and/or Tranche B Banks, as applicable,
thereof. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and
shall obligate the Borrower to accept the Loan(s) requested from the Banks on
the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Loan Request shall be in a minimum aggregate
amount of $100,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The Borrower shall not
submit more frequently than once a calendar week a Loan Request for a Tranche A
Loan.

         2.6.  FUNDS FOR LOANS.

                  2.6.1. FUNDING PROCEDURES. Subject to the terms and conditions
         set forth herein (including receipt by each Bank of a Loan Request
         within the time period specified in Section 2.5), not later than 1:00
         p.m. (Providence, Rhode Island time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of
         any Loans, each of the Tranche A Banks and/or Tranche B Banks, as
         applicable, will make available to the Agent, at the Agent's Office, in
         immediately available funds, the amount of such Bank's Tranche A
         Commitment Percentage and/or Tranche B Commitment Percentage, as
         applicable, of the amount of the requested Loans. Upon receipt from
         each such Bank of such amount, and upon receipt of the documents
         required by Sections 10 and 11 and the satisfaction of the other
         conditions set forth herein, to the extent applicable, the Agent will
         make available to the Borrower the aggregate amount of such Loans made
         available to the Agent by the Banks. The failure or refusal of any Bank
         to make available to the Agent at the aforesaid time and place on any
         Drawdown Date the amount of its applicable Commitment Percentage of the
         requested Loans shall not relieve any other Bank from its several
         obligation hereunder to make available to the Agent the amount of such
         other Bank's applicable Commitment Percentage of any requested Loans.

                  2.6.2. ADVANCES BY AGENT. The Agent may, unless notified to
         the contrary by any Bank prior to a Drawdown Date, assume that such
         Bank has made available to the Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount
         of such Bank's applicable Commitment Percentage of the Loans to be made
         on such



<PAGE>
                                       32


         Drawdown Date, and the Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in
         reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
         corresponding amount. If any Bank makes available to the Agent such
         amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Bank shall pay to the
         Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the average
         computed for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of the
         weighted average interest rate paid by the Agent for federal funds
         acquired by the Agent during each day included in such period, times
         (ii) the amount of such Bank's applicable Commitment Percentage of such
         Loans, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
         days that elapse from and including such Drawdown Date (or such later
         date which is two Business Days after such Bank received the Loan
         Request for such Loan) to the date on which the amount of such Bank's
         applicable Commitment Percentage of such Loans shall become immediately
         available to the Agent, and the denominator of which is 365. A
         statement of the Agent submitted to such Bank with respect to any
         amounts owing under this paragraph shall be prima facie evidence of the
         amount due and owing to the Agent by such Bank. If the amount of such
         Bank's applicable Commitment Percentage of such Loans is not made
         available to the Agent by such Bank within three (3) Business Days
         following such Drawdown Date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover
         such amount from the Borrower on demand, with interest thereon at the
         rate per annum applicable to the Loans made on such Drawdown Date.

         2.7. CHANGE IN BORROWING BASE; INELIGIBLE CONSUMER LOANS. (a) The
Borrowing Base shall be determined weekly (or at such other intervals as may be
specified pursuant to Section 7.4(f)) by the Agent by reference to the Borrowing
Base Certificate delivered to the Banks and the Agent pursuant to Section 7.4(f)
and other information obtained by or provided to the Agent or any of the Banks.
The Agent shall give to the Borrower written notice of any change in the
Borrowing Base determined by the Required Banks. In the case of any change in
the general criteria for Eligible Consumer Loans, such notice shall be effective
upon its receipt by the Borrower. Prior to the time that such notice becomes
effective, the Borrowing Base shall be computed as it would have been computed
in the absence of such notice.

         (b) If any consumer loan pledged as Consumer Loan Collateral shall
subsequent to the pledge under the Security Agreement no longer qualify as an
Eligible Consumer Loan, such consumer loan shall be excluded from the Borrowing
Base, and the Borrower (i) shall replace such consumer loan with an Eligible
Consumer Loan that provides the same amount of credit to the Borrowing Base,
(ii) shall reduce the amount of outstanding Tranche A Loans (if necessary) so
that the total amount of Tranche A Loans outstanding shall not exceed the
Borrowing Base, or (iii) if the Borrower is unable to replace such consumer loan
with an Eligible Consumer Loan or reduce the Tranche A Loan, and the Required
Banks give their prior written consent, may replace such consumer loan with a
consumer loan that does not satisfy the criteria for being classified as an
Eligible Consumer Loan. In the event that any Eligible Consumer Loan becomes
available thereafter, the Borrower shall promptly substitute such Eligible
Consumer Loan for the ineligible consumer loan pledged to the Agent.

         2.8. REPAYMENTS OF LOANS PRIOR TO EVENT OF DEFAULT.

                  2.8.1. CREDIT FOR FUNDS RECEIVED IN BORROWER'S ACCOUNT. Prior
         to the occurrence of an Event of Default as to which the account
         officers of the Agent active upon the Borrower's account have actual
         knowledge, (i) all funds and cash proceeds in the form of money, checks
         and like items received in the Borrower's Account as contemplated by
         Section 7.18 shall be credited, on the same Business Day on which the
         Agent determines that good collected funds have been received, and,
         prior to the receipt of good collected funds, may, in the Agent's
         discretion, be credited on a provisional basis until final receipt of
         good collected funds, and applied as contemplated by Section 2.8.2,
         (ii) all funds and cash proceeds in the form of a wire transfer
         received in the Borrower's Account as contemplated by Section 7.18
         shall be credited on the same Business Day as the Agent's receipt of
         such amounts (or up to such later date as the Agent determines that
         good collected funds have been received), and applied as contemplated
         by Section 2.8.2, and (iii) all funds and cash proceeds in the form of
         an automated clearing house transfer received in the Borrower's Account
         as contemplated by Section 7.18 shall be credited, on the next Business
         Day following the Agent's receipt of such amounts (or up to such later
         date as the Agent determines that good collected funds have been
         received), and applied as contemplated by Section 2.8.2. For purposes
         of the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8.1, the Agent shall not
         be deemed to have received any such funds or cash proceeds on any day
         unless received by the Agent before 2:30 p.m. (Providence, Rhode Island
         time) on such day. The Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that
         any such provisional credits or credits in respect of wire or automatic
         clearing house funds transfers shall be subject to reversal if final
         collection in good funds of the related item is not received by, or
         final settlement of the funds transfer is not made in favor of, the
         Agent in accordance with the Agent's customary procedures and practices
         for collecting provisional items or receiving settlement of funds
         transfers.

                  2.8.2. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS PRIOR TO EVENT OF DEFAULT.

                  (a) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default of which
         the account officers of the Agent active on the Borrower's account have
         knowledge, and except as otherwise provided in Section 2.8.2(b) and
         (c), all funds transferred to the Borrower's Account and for which the
         Borrower has received credits shall be applied to the Obligations once
         each calendar week as follows:

                           (i) first, to pay the fees, expenses, costs, and any
                  past due amounts (other than principal and interest on any
                  Loans) due and payable by the Borrower to the Agent or any
                  Bank;

                           (ii) second, to pay interest then due and payable on

                  Tranche B Loans, and any other Obligations then due and

                  Loans pro rata based upon the respective Tranche A Commitment
                  Percentages of the Banks; and

                           (vi) sixth, to reduce any remaining principal of the
                  Tranche B Loans.

                  (b) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default of which
         the account officers of the Agent active on the Borrower's account have
         knowledge, any funds in the Borrower's Account constituting (1) the Net
         Cash Proceeds of the sale or other disposition of any of the Additional

                  Bank;

                  Tranche B Loans, and any other Obligations then due and
                  payable (other than the principal of the Loans);

                           (iii) third, to reduce the principal of the Tranche B

                  Percentages of the Banks;

                           (iv) fourth, to reduce any remaining principal of the

                           (v) fifth, to reduce the principal of the Tranche A
                  Loans.

         be allocated among the Banks making such Loans, in proportion, as
         nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amount of
         such Loans outstanding, with adjustments to the extent practicable to
         equalize any prior payments or repayments not exactly in proportion.

         2.9. REPAYMENTS OF LOANS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. Following the

account officers of the Agent active on the Borrower's account have knowledge,
all funds transferred to the Borrower's Account and for which the Borrower has
received credits shall be applied to the Obligations in accordance with Section
12.5.

                           3. REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS.

         3.1. MATURITY.

         (a) Tranche A Maturity Date. The Borrower promises to pay on the

<PAGE>
                                       36


         (b) Tranche B Maturity Date. The Borrower promises to pay on the

         3.2. MANDATORY REPAYMENTS OF LOANS.

         (a) Scheduled Payments of Tranche A Loans. Not later than December 31,
2004, the Borrower may request in writing to the Agent and the Tranche A Banks
that the Tranche A Conversion Date be extended. If the Agent and each of the
Tranche A Banks, in their sole discretion, consent to such request, the Tranche
A Conversion Date shall be extended for such period as determined by the Agent
and the Tranche A Banks. Effective upon the occurrence of the Tranche A
Conversion Date, the Tranche A Commitments shall terminate and the Borrower
shall pay the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Loans by applying
thereto the proceeds from the Consumer Loan Collateral in accordance with
Sections 2.8 and 2.9, with a final payment on the Tranche A Maturity Date in an
amount equal to the unpaid balance of the Tranche A Loans. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower agrees that on and after the
Tranche A Conversion Date, the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche A
Loans shall be reduced in substantial accordance with the Business Plan. Absent
a Default or an Event of Default, following the Tranche A Conversion Date, all
payments of principal and interest on the Consumer Loan Collateral shall
continue to be paid to the Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Banks and the
Agent, and the Agent shall apply such payments as set forth in Section 2.8.2(a)
to satisfy the Borrower's obligations under this Section 3.2(a).

         (b) Overadvances. If at any time the sum of the outstanding amount of
the Tranche A Loans exceeds the Tranche A Total Commitment then in effect, then
the Borrower shall immediately pay the amount of such excess to the Agent for
application to the Tranche A Loans. In the event that the aggregate outstanding
Tranche A Loans at any time exceed the Borrowing Base or the outstanding Tranche
A Loans and Tranche B Loans exceed 95% of the Eligible Consumer Loan Amount, the
Borrower (i) shall pay the amount of such excess to the Agent for application to
the outstanding Tranche A Loans, (ii) shall pledge sufficient Eligible Consumer
Loans to increase the Borrowing Base to equal or exceed the outstanding
principal amount of the Tranche A Loans, or (iii) if the Borrower is unable to
pay such excess or pledge additional Eligible Consumer Loans, and the Required
Banks give their prior written consent, may deliver to the Agent consumer loans
that do not satisfy the criteria for being classified as Eligible Consumer
Loans. If at any time the sum of the outstanding amount of the Tranche B Loans
exceeds the Tranche B Total Commitment then in effect, then the Borrower shall
immediately pay the amount of such excess to the Agent for application to the
Tranche B Loans.

         (c) Mandatory Tranche B Fund Up Prepayment. If and to the extent that:
(i) at the end of each calendar quarter during the first two (2) years following
the Closing Date, commencing with the quarter beginning on April 1, 2002 (x) the
outstanding principal balance of all Tranche A Loans is less than seventy
percent


<PAGE>
                                       37


(70%) of the then Eligible Consumer Loan Amount (such difference being
hereinafter referred to as an "AVAILABLE FUND-UP Amount") and (y) provided the
Borrower has Available Cash on Hand of five million dollars ($5,000,000) or more
as indicated in the most recent Weekly Flash Report or (ii) at the end of the
calendar quarter commencing April 1, 2004, if the Tranche A Conversion Date has
not yet occurred, (x) the outstanding principal balance of all Tranche A Loans
is less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the then Eligible Consumer Loan
Amount (such difference also being referred to as an "AVAILABLE FUND-UP AMOUNT")
and (y) provided the Borrower has Available Cash on Hand of five million dollars
($5,000,000) or more as indicated in the most recent Weekly Flash Report, then
the Borrower agrees that the Agent may, on the last Business Day of each such
calendar quarter, make a Tranche A Loan in an amount equal to such Available
Fund Up Amount and apply such Tranche A Loan to the repayment of the outstanding
Tranche B Loans as follows: (i) first, to pay interest then due and payable on
the Tranche B Loans and the Tranche A Loans and (ii) second, to reduce the
principal of the Tranche B Loans pro rata based on the respective Tranche A
Commitment Percentages of the Banks until such time as the Tranche B Loans are
paid in full. Any such reduction of the Tranche B Loans shall permanently reduce
the Tranche B Commitments by a corresponding amount.

         (d) Further Quarterly Payments. If, at the end of any calendar quarter
commencing the quarter beginning on April 1, 2002, the Borrower has Available
Cash on Hand exceeding five million dollars ($5,000,000), as indicated in the
most recent Weekly Flash Report (the "ADDITIONAL AVAILABLE AMOUNT"), then the
Borrower agrees to repay the Loans in an amount equal to such Additional
Available Amount and such amount will be applied as follows: (i) first, to pay
interest then due and payable on the Tranche B Loans and the Tranche A Loans,
(iii) second, to reduce the principal of the Tranche B Loans pro rata based upon
the respective Tranche A Commitment Percentages of the Banks until such time as
the Tranche B Loans are paid in full, and (iii) third, to reduce the principal
of the Tranche A Loans. Any such reduction of the Tranche B Loans shall
permanently reduce the Tranche B Commitments by a corresponding amount.

         3.3. OPTIONAL REPAYMENTS OF LOANS. The Borrower shall have the right,
at its election, to repay the outstanding amount of the Loans, as a whole or in
part, at any time without penalty or premium. The Borrower shall give the Agent,
no later than 10:00 a.m., Providence, Rhode Island time, at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice, of any proposed repayment pursuant to this
Section 3.3 of Loans, specifying the proposed date of payment of Loans and the
principal amount to be paid. Each such partial prepayment of the Loans shall be
in an integral multiple of $100,000, shall be accompanied by the payment of
accrued interest on the principal repaid to the date of payment and shall be
applied first to the outstanding Tranche B Loans and, after the outstanding
Tranche B Loans have been repaid in full, then to the outstanding Tranche A
Loans. No Tranche B Loans so repaid may be reborrowed. Each partial prepayment
shall be allocated among the applicable Banks, in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amount of each Bank's Tranche A
Note or Tranche B Note, as applicable, with adjustments to the extent
practicable to equalize any prior repayments not exactly in proportion.

                         4. CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

         4.1. FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

                  4.1.1. PAYMENTS TO AGENT. All payments of principal, interest,
         and any other amounts due hereunder or under any of the other Loan
         Documents shall be made on the due date thereof to the Agent in
         Dollars, for the respective accounts of the applicable Banks and the
         Agent, at the Agent's Office or at such other place that the Agent may
         from time to time designate, in each case at or about 11:00 a.m.
         (Providence, Rhode Island, time or other local time at the place of
         payment) and in immediately available funds.

                  4.1.2. NO OFFSET, ETC. All payments by the Borrower hereunder
         and under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made without
         recoupment, setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without
         deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
         deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions
         of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or
         any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein
         unless the Borrower is compelled by law to make such deduction or
         withholding. If any such obligation is imposed upon the Borrower with
         respect to any amount payable by it hereunder or under any of the other
         Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay to the Agent, for the account of
         the applicable Banks or (as the case may be) the Agent, on the date on
         which such amount is due and payable hereunder or under such other Loan
         Document, such additional amount in Dollars as shall be necessary to
         enable the applicable Banks or the Agent to receive the same net amount
         which such Banks or the Agent would have received on such due date had
         no such obligation been imposed upon the Borrower. The Borrower will
         deliver promptly to the Agent certificates or other valid vouchers for
         all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to
         payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under such other Loan
         Document.

         4.2. COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest on the Loans shall be
based on a 360-day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. Whenever
a payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue during such
extension. The outstanding amount of the Loans as reflected on the Note Records
from time to time shall be considered correct and binding on the Borrower unless
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of any notice by the Agent or any of
the Banks of such outstanding amount, the Agent or such Bank shall notify the
Borrower to the contrary.

         4.3. ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If any present or future applicable law,
which expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations
thereunder and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by any
governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to


<PAGE>
                                       39


time hereafter made upon or otherwise issued to any Bank or the Agent by any
central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether or not having
the force of law), shall:

                  (a) subject any Bank or the Agent to any tax, levy, impost,
         duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with respect
         to this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, such Bank's Tranche
         A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment or any of the Loans (other than
         taxes based upon or measured by the income or profits of such Bank or
         the Agent), or

                  (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for
         changes in taxes on income or profits) of payments to any Bank of the
         principal of or the interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable
         to any Bank or the Agent under this Credit Agreement or the other Loan
         Documents, or

                  (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the
         extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Credit Agreement)
         any special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy
         or other similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law)
         against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans
         by, or commitments of an office of any Bank, or

                  (d) impose on any Bank or the Agent any other conditions or
         requirements with respect to this Credit Agreement, the other Loan
         Documents, any of the Loans, such Bank's Tranche A Commitment or
         Tranche B Commitment, or any class of loans or commitments of which any
         of the Loans or such Bank's Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B
         Commitment forms a part, and the result of any of the foregoing is

                           (i) to increase the cost to any Bank of making,
                  funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of
                  the Loans or such Bank's Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B
                  Commitment, or

                           (ii) to reduce the amount of principal, interest, or
                  other amount payable to such Bank or the Agent hereunder on
                  account of such Bank's Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B
                  Commitment or any of the Loans, or

                           (iii) to require such Bank or the Agent to make any
                  payment or to forego any interest or other sum payable
                  hereunder, the amount of which payment or foregone interest or
                  other sum is calculated by reference to the gross amount of
                  any sum receivable or deemed received by such Bank or the
                  Agent from the Borrower hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, upon demand made by such Bank or
(as the case may be) the Agent at any time and from time to time and as often as
the occasion therefor may arise, pay to such Bank or the Agent such additional
amounts


<PAGE>
                                       40


as will be sufficient to compensate such Bank or the Agent for such additional
cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or other sum.

         4.4. CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If after the date hereof any Bank or the Agent
determines that (i) the adoption of or change in any law, governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies or any
change in the interpretation or application thereof by a court or governmental
authority with appropriate jurisdiction, or (ii) compliance by such Bank or the
Agent or any corporation controlling such Bank or the Agent with any law,
governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such entity regarding capital adequacy, has the
effect of reducing the return on such Bank's or the Agent's commitment with
respect to any Loans to a level below that which such Bank or the Agent could
have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Bank's or the Agent's then existing policies with respect to
capital adequacy and assuming full utilization of such entity's capital) by any
amount deemed by such Bank or (as the case may be) the Agent to be material,
then such Bank or the Agent may notify the Borrower of such fact. To the extent
that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not reflected in
the Base Rate, the Borrower agrees to pay such Bank or (as the case may be) the
Agent for the amount of such reduction in the return on capital as and when such
reduction is determined upon presentation by such Bank or (as the case may be)
the Agent of a certificate in accordance with Section 4.5 hereof. Each Bank
shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith and on an
equitable basis.

         4.5. CERTIFICATE. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts
payable pursuant to Sections 4.3 or 4.4 and a brief explanation of such amounts
which are due, submitted by any Bank or the Agent to the Borrower, shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due and owing.

         4.6. INDEMNITY. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and to hold
each Bank harmless from and against any loss, cost or expense (including loss of
anticipated profits) that such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of
default by the Borrower in making a borrowing after the Borrower has given (or
is deemed to have given) a Loan Request.

         4.7. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.

                  4.7.1. OVERDUE AMOUNTS. Overdue principal and (to the extent
         permitted by applicable law) interest on the Tranche A Loans and all
         other overdue amounts payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan
         Documents shall bear interest compounded monthly and payable on demand
         at a rate per annum equal to four percent (4%) above the Base Rate
         until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well as before
         judgment). Overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by applicable
         law) interest on the Tranche B Loans shall bear interest compounded
         monthly and payable on demand at a rate per annum equal to four percent
         (4%) above the interest


<PAGE>
                                       41


         rate applicable to the Tranche B Loans pursuant to Section 2.4 until
         such amounts shall be paid in full (after as well as before judgment).

                  4.7.2. AMOUNTS NOT OVERDUE. During the continuance of a
         Default or an Event of Default, the principal of the Loans not overdue
         shall, until such Default or Event of Default has been cured or
         remedied or such Default or Event of Default has been waived by the
         Required Banks pursuant to Section 24, bear interest at a rate per
         annum equal to four percent (4%) above the rate of interest otherwise
         applicable to such Loans pursuant to Section 2.4. Any installment or
         payment due hereunder which shall be received by the Agent more than
         ten (10) days after its due date shall be subject to an additional
         charge of five percent (5%) per annum on the amount so overdue (but in
         not event higher than the maximum allowed by applicable law).

       5. SECURITY; SERVICING AGREEMENT; LOCK BOX AGREEMENT AND COLLATERAL
                              CUSTODIAN AGREEMENT.

         5.1. COLLATERAL. Pursuant to the Security Documents, the Obligations
shall be secured by a perfected security interest in the Collateral with the
priority set forth in the applicable Security Documents (subject only to
Permitted Liens entitled to priority under applicable law).

         5.2. LOCK BOX AGREEMENT. Pursuant to the Initial Lockbox Agreement,
Chase shall receive in the lock box identified therein all payments on loans
constituting Consumer Loan Collateral and other consumer loans pledged to the
Agent (other than the Ineligible Note Portfolio) in the ordinary course of
business. By June 30, 2002, the Borrower and the Agent shall have entered into a
replacement lockbox agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Required Banks (the "REPLACEMENT LOCKBOX AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which
Sovereign shall replace Chase as the lock box agent. By September 30, 2002, the
Borrower shall have delivered to each of the consumer borrowers of an Eligible
Consumer Loan included in the calculation of the Eligible Consumer Loan Amount
as of such date a notice, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent,
instructing such consumer borrower to remit payments in respect of its Eligible
Consumer Loan directly to the Lock Box with Sovereign. Following such
replacement, the Initial Lockbox Agreement shall remain in effect for a
transitional period satisfactory to the Required Banks. Chase or Sovereign, to
the extent then the effective lockbox agent, shall deposit to the Borrower's
Account all payments collected with respect to the Consumer Loan Collateral and
other consumer loans pledged to the Agent (other than the Ineligible Note
Portfolio) on each Business Day. All amounts deposited by Chase or, in its
capacity solely as the lockbox agent, Sovereign in the Borrower's Account shall
be applied by the Agent on a weekly basis as provided in Section 2.8 or Section
2.9, as the case may be.

         5.3. COLLATERAL CUSTODIAL. Pursuant to the Custodial Agreement, dated
as of August 11, 2002, as amended by the First Amendment to Custodial Agreement
date on or prior to the date hereof, among the Agent, the Borrower and the
Collateral Custodian (as so amended, the "COLLATERAL CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT"), the

<PAGE>
                                       42


Collateral Custodian shall hold, as collateral agent for the Agent, all of the
Consumer Loan Collateral (including the Required Consumer Loan Documents).

         5.4. SERVICING AGREEMENT. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated
Servicing Agreement, of even date herewith (the "SERVICING AGREEMENT") among the
Borrower, the Agent and the Borrower, as servicer (the "SERVICER"), the Servicer
shall service and administer loans constituting Consumer Loan Collateral in the
ordinary course of business. The Servicer shall administer all amounts due to
the Borrower with respect to the Consumer Loan Collateral and shall direct
payment to the Lock Box of all amounts to be collected with respect to the
Consumer Loan Collateral. All amounts directed by the Servicer to the Lock Box
shall be transferred to the Borrower's Account as set forth in Section 5.2 and
applied by the Agent as set forth in Section 2.8 or Section 2.9, as the case may
be. The Servicer shall provide to the Agent such reports and perform such other
functions as the Agent shall require. Following an Event of Default or for other
good cause, the Agent shall be entitled to establish a substitute servicing
arrangement with a servicer acceptable to the Required Banks at any time.

         5.5. COLLATERAL PROCEDURES. The Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the
Required Consumer Loan Documents from time to time to such locations and in such
manner acceptable to the Agent as the Agent shall reasonably determine. The
Borrower shall take any actions required by the Agent to obtain the release of
any lien or security interest in favor of any party other than the Agent in any
Consumer Loan Collateral. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent all custodial
costs incurred, as determined by the Agent. With the prior consent of the Agent
in each instance, in its sole discretion, the Borrower shall be entitled to
effect delivery to the Agent by delivery to the Collateral Custodian or a
successor custodian approved by the Agent. All consumer loans delivered by the
Borrower to the Agent or the Collateral Custodian shall be accompanied by the
Required Consumer Loan Documents, and the Borrower shall be deemed to represent
and warrant in connection with all such loans delivered to the Agent or the
Collateral Custodian that the certifications required to be included in the
Consumer Loan Cover Sheet are true even if no such cover sheet shall be
delivered by the Borrower. The Borrower shall promptly deliver to the Agent or
the Collateral Custodian any additional documents related to any Consumer Loan
Collateral which the Borrower acquires after delivery to the Agent or the
Collateral Custodian of the Required Consumer Loan Documents.

         5.6. ELIGIBLE PROJECTS.

         (a) Proposed Additional Projects. The Borrower may propose additional
projects to be included as Eligible Projects. The Agent shall conduct such
review of such projects as the Agent shall deem appropriate, including, without
limitation, review of all timeshare instruments, consumer loan documents, real
estate documents, amenities agreements, management contracts, marketing
contracts, and other documentation related to such project. The Agent, with the
consent of all of the Banks, shall be entitled to approve or not approve such
proposed project as an Eligible Project.


<PAGE>
                                       43


         (b) Acceptance of Additional Projects. Upon the approval by all of the
Banks of a proposed project as an Eligible Project, EXHIBIT E shall be deemed
amended to include such project and the Agent shall circulate a revised EXHIBIT
E containing such additional projects to the Banks. The Borrower shall take such
other action as the Banks shall require in connection with such project,
including, without limitation, the subordination of any applicable management
and marketing fees, the delivery of an opinion from local counsel in the
jurisdiction where such project is located, or any other action as the Agent
shall require. Upon the inclusion of an additional project as an Eligible
Project, all representations, warranties and covenants of the Borrower with
regard to the Eligible Projects in the Loan Documents shall be deemed amended to
refer to the additional Eligible Project.

         5.7. SECURITY INTERESTS IN ALL CONSUMER LOAN COLLATERAL AND OTHER
CONSUMER LOANS. The Agent shall have a first-priority perfected security
interest in the Consumer Loan Collateral and a second-priority security interest
in any loans pledged by the Borrower to Heller or Textron and included in
Heller's or Textron's borrowing bases, perfected to the extent set forth in the
Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding that the Banks are obligated, subject
to the conditions of the Loan Documents, to make Tranche A Loans only in respect
of Eligible Consumer Loans pledged to the Agent from and after the Closing Date,
the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, shall have a continuing security
interest in all of the Consumer Loan Collateral, all consumer loans constituting
part of the Ineligible Note Portfolio and any consumer loans pledged to Heller
or Textron and the Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, collect all payments made
under or in respect of all such Consumer Loan Collateral, including, without
limitation, Eligible Consumer Loans that are or may become ineligible, until any
of the same may be released by Agent, if at all, pursuant to Section 8.1 or the
Security Agreement. The Agent shall have a security interest in the Ineligible
Note Portfolio perfected by the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything heretofore to the contrary, unless and until an Event
of Default shall occur, the Borrower, as agent for and on behalf of the Agent,
Heller and Textron, will retain possession of and collect all payments under or
in respect of all consumer loans in the Ineligible Note Portfolio, subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. By executing this Agreement, the
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it is holding the consumer loans
constituting the Ineligible Note Portfolio as bailee and agent for the Agent.
The Borrower shall hold and designate such consumer loans and the mortgages or
deeds of trust related thereto in a manner that clearly indicates that they are
being held by the Borrower as bailee on behalf of the Agent. Upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall promptly deliver to Textron, as agent
for the Banks, Heller and itself, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, all original consumer loans comprising the Ineligible Note Portfolio,
and the related mortgages and deeds of trust. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Textron, in such capacity as agent, shall have the right to collect all
proceeds therefrom for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that upon
repayment in full of the Heller Facility or the Textron Facility, the Agent's
security interest in the collateral securing such facilities shall automatically
become a first priority security interest for the Obligations and the Borrower
shall take such


<PAGE>
                                       44


steps as the Agent may request to deliver such collateral to the Agent and to
confirm the Agent's first priority security interest therein.

         5.8. RELEASE OF CERTAIN COLLATERAL. Upon the Borrower's repayment in
full of all Obligations under and in respect of the Tranche B Loans, the Agent
shall release its security interest in and mortgage on the Existing Mortgaged
Property, the Additional Resort Collateral, and the Silverleaf Finance I, Inc.
Stock; provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default shall exist and (ii)
Heller and Textron shall be releasing simultaneously their interest, if any, in
such Collateral.

                       6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Banks and the Agent as
follows:

         6.1. CORPORATE AUTHORITY.

                  6.1.1. INCORPORATION; GOOD STANDING. Each of the Borrower and
         its Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
         and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas (in the case
         of the Borrower) or its state of incorporation (in the case of its
         Subsidiaries), (ii) has all requisite corporate power to own its
         property and conduct its business as now conducted and as presently
         contemplated, and (iii) is in good standing as a foreign corporation
         and is duly authorized to do business in each jurisdiction where such
         qualification is necessary. The Borrower's tax identification number is
         75-2259890.

                  6.1.2. AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and performance
         of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is or is to become a party and the
         transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (i) are within the
         corporate authority of such Person, (ii) have been duly authorized by
         all necessary corporate proceedings, (iii) do not conflict with or
         result in any breach or contravention of any provision of law, statute,

         7.7.  INSURANCE.

         (a) Insurance Generally. The Borrower will maintain the insurance
coverage set forth below with financially sound and reputable insurers in the
amounts and for the periods set forth below.

                  (i) At all times during the term of this Agreement, the
         Borrower shall maintain insurance for each Eligible Project against
         loss by fire, windstorm and other hazards, with minimum coverage equal
         to the replacement cost of each Eligible Project.

                  (ii) At all times during the term of this Agreement, the
         Borrower shall maintain broad form coverage public liability insurance
         with minimum coverage of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). The amount
         of such coverage shall be reviewed annually by the Required Banks and
         may, in the Required Banks' sole discretion and at the Borrower's
         expense, be increased or decreased during the term of this Agreement.
         The Borrower shall obtain a new or revised policy within twenty (20)
         days of receipt of notice from the Agent of a revision in the amount of
         public liability insurance required.

                  (iii) If any of the improvements now or hereafter constructed
         on the Real Estate are within an area designated by the Director of the
         Federal Emergency Management Agency, pursuant to the Flood Disaster
         Protection Act of 1973, as amended, as one having special flood

                  (v) The Borrower will maintain insurance on each of the
         Mortgaged Properties in accordance with the terms of the applicable
         Mortgage.

thirty (30) days' prior notice by the insurance carrier to the Agent, and that
the Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Banks shall be named as an additional
insured, mortgagee and lender's loss payee on such policies. The Borrower shall
at least thirty (30) days


<PAGE>
                                       60


prior to the expiration date of each policy, and otherwise, from time to time
upon the Agent's request, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Agent and the
Banks, evidence of the maintenance of the insurance required by this Section
7.7, including, without limitation, such originals or copies as the Agent may
request of policies, certificates of insurance, riders and endorsements relating
to such insurance and proof of premium payments.

         (b) Project Title Policies. In addition to the foregoing, in connection
with each Eligible Project (other than Oak N' Spruce Resort), the Borrower shall
provide a mortgagee title insurance policy in favor of the Agent for the pro
rata benefit of the Banks on a current ALTA Loan Policy Form issued by a title
insurance company qualified to do business in the State of Texas or the
jurisdiction of the respective Eligible Project and acceptable to the Agent
issued in the amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding
principal amount of the consumer loans from such Eligible Project pledged to the
Agent under the Security Agreement and insuring that the mortgages or deed of
trusts referred to in clause (2) of the definition of "Required Consumer Loan
Documents" are not subject to any prior liens, other than certain Permitted
Liens, substantially in the form of the specimen policy for each Eligible
Project attached as SCHEDULE 7.7 attached hereto (each a "PROJECT TITLE
POLICY"). The Project Title Policies shall contain only those exceptions
approved by the Agent, in writing, and shall contain affirmative insurance for
real estate taxes, matters of survey and against mechanics liens. Any material
deviation from such specimen policy shall require the Agent's consent. If the
Agent or the Banks at any time shall determine that title to any Collateral or
the assignment to the Agent of the Borrower's rights in such Collateral shall be
defective in any respect, the Borrower shall within sixty (60) days after a
request by the Agent provide to the Agent and the Banks title insurance in favor

on a consolidated basis) imposed upon it and its real properties, sales and

and if the Borrower or such Subsidiary shall have set aside on its books
adequate reserves with respect thereto with the consent of the Required Banks;
and provided further that the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the Borrower will
pay all such taxes, assessments, charges, levies or claims forthwith upon the

         opinion of the Agent or the Required Banks, materially impairs its
         security interest or increases its risk;

                  (p) there shall occur the loss, suspension or revocation of,
         or failure to renew, any license or permit now held or hereafter
         acquired by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries if such loss,

         adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Borrower
         or such Subsidiary;

                  (q) the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be indicted
         for a state or federal crime, or any civil or criminal action shall
         otherwise have been brought or threatened against the Borrower or any
         of its Subsidiaries, a punishment for which in any such case could
         include the forfeiture of any assets of the Borrower or such Subsidiary
         included in the Borrowing Base or any assets of the Borrower or such
         Subsidiary not included in the Borrowing Base but having a fair market

         shall have acquired beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule
         13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under said
         Act) of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the
         Borrower (other than Robert E. Mead); (ii) during any period of twelve
         consecutive calendar months, individuals who were directors of the
         Borrower on the first day of such period shall cease to constitute a

         shall occur any change in the Borrower's key management personnel
         (whether by termination, death, incompetence or otherwise), which the

         change, the Borrower does not have in place a team of key management
         personnel with skills at least commensurate, in the reasonable opinion
         of the Required Banks, with those of the Borrower's key management team
         in place as of the date hereof.

         Collateral or in the business, operations, properties or condition
         (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, which, in the opinion of the
         Agent or the Required Banks, impairs its security or increases its
         risk, including, without limitation, if any financial information
         furnished to the Agent or Banks shall indicate any

         operating loss or total liabilities in excess of total assets, as
         determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
         (in the absence of any operating loss or total liabilities in excess of
         total assets, any adverse change which has less than a five percent
         (5%) one time or annual adverse impact on any of the Borrower's
         revenues, net profit, net worth or assets shall not be deemed
         material);

                  (w) the Borrower, Silverleaf Club or any Association shall
         fail to fund maintenance fees, taxes, reserves, or other payments
         required for the proper and efficient operation of any Eligible

         Documents;

                  (y) any material adverse change in the financial condition of
         the Borrower or in the condition of the Collateral (for purposes of
         this provision, a decline in the net worth of the Borrower of $100,000
         or less shall not be considered a material adverse change); or

                  (z) DZ Bank does not purchase loans in substantially the
         amounts and during the periods specified in the Business Plan or if the
         proceeds of such purchase are insufficient to make the principal
         payments described in Section 3.2 hereof or if Borrower fails to apply
         such proceeds to repayment of the Loans as provided in Section 3.2
         hereof.

then, and in any such event, so long as the same may be continuing, the Agent
may, and upon the request of the Required Banks shall, by notice in writing to
the Borrower declare all amounts owing with respect to this Credit Agreement,
the Notes and the other Loan Documents to be, and they shall thereupon forthwith
become, immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrower; provided that in the event of any Event of Default specified in
Sections 12.1(h), 12.1(i) or


<PAGE>
                                       87


12.1(k), all such amounts shall become immediately due and payable automatically
and without any requirement of notice from the Agent or any Bank.

         12.2. TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. If any one or more of the Events of
Default specified in Section 12.1(h), Section 12.1(1) or Section 12.1(k) shall
occur, any unused portion of the credit hereunder shall forthwith terminate and
each of the Banks shall be relieved of all obligations to make Loans to the
Borrower. If any other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
or if on any Drawdown Date the conditions precedent to the making of the Loans
to be made on such Drawdown Date are not satisfied, the Agent may and, upon the
request of the Required Banks, shall, by notice to the Borrower, terminate the
unused portion of the credit hereunder, and upon such notice being given such
unused portion of the credit hereunder shall terminate immediately and each of
the Banks shall be relieved of all further obligations to make Loans. If any
such notice is given to the Borrower, the Agent will forthwith furnish a copy
thereof to each of the Banks. No termination of the credit hereunder shall
relieve the Borrower of any of the Obligations or any of its existing
obligations to any of the Banks arising under other agreements or instruments.

         12.3. REMEDIES. In case any one or more of the Events of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Banks shall have
accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 12.1, each Bank, if
owed any amount with respect to the Loans, may, with the consent of the Required
Banks but not otherwise, proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in
equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific
performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Credit Agreement and
the other Loan Documents or any instrument pursuant to which the Obligations to
such Bank are evidenced, including as permitted by applicable law the obtaining
of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount shall have become
due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any
other legal or equitable right of such Bank. In addition to foregoing, the Agent
may, and at the request of the Required Banks shall, pursue any of the foregoing
remedies: (i) deliver Notices to Maker (which Notices to Maker shall not be
delivered in the absence of an Event of Default) and other notices to account
debtors and servicers that payments should be made directly to the Agent, record
or file assignments or mortgages, complete blank endorsements and take such
other actions as the Agent shall deem necessary to exercise rights in the
Collateral or assign the Collateral, (ii) require the Borrower to give notice to
account debtors and servicers that payment should be made directly to the Agent,
(iii) require the Borrower to assemble Collateral and make it available to the
Agent at a place designated by the Agent which is reasonably convenient, and
(iv) in its name or in the Borrower's name, without notice to the Borrower, and
at Borrower's expense (A) verify the validity and amount of or any other matter
relating to the Consumer Loan Collateral, by mail, telephone, facsimile or
otherwise or (B) direct all consumer borrowers to make payment directly to the
Agent or a Person designated by the Agent and forward invoices directly to such
consumer borrowers. No remedy herein conferred upon any Bank or the Agent or the
holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and
every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy
given hereunder

                                       88


or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other
provision of law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or any other
Loan Documents, the Agent and the Banks shall not, by virtue of entering into
this Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the exercise of rights
hereunder or thereunder, be deemed to have assumed any obligations,
responsibilities or duties of the Borrower in respect of any Eligible Projects,
Timeshare Interests, Timeshare Instruments or other documents, instruments or
agreements relating to the business of the Borrower.

         12.4. STANDBY SERVICER AND STANDBY MANAGER. Without demand or notice of
any nature whatsoever, upon an Event of Default, the Agent may, and at the
request of the Required Banks shall, with the approval of a majority of the
Borrower's Board of Directors, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(provided that (i) if the Obligations have become immediately due and payable in
accordance with Section 12.1 hereof or (ii) the Required Banks elect to have J&J
Limited, Inc. act as Standby Manager, then no such approval shall be required),
terminate any then existing management agreement and replace any existing
manager of the Eligible Projects with the Standby Manager, or such other manager
as the Required Banks may select in their sole and absolute discretion. Upon an
Event of Default, the Agent may, and at the request of the Required Banks shall,
without demand or notice of any nature whatsoever, terminate any then existing
servicing agreement and replace any then existing servicer with the Standby
Servicer or such other servicer as the Required Banks may select in their sole
and absolute discretion. Upon an Event of Default, at the election of the
Required Banks, the Borrower agrees that with the approval of the Borrower's
Board of Directors, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (provided that
(i) if the Obligations have become immediately due and payable in accordance
with Section 12.1 hereof or (ii) the Required Banks elect to have J&J Limited,
Inc. act as Standby Manager, then no such approval shall be required), the
Standby Manager or such other manager as the Required Banks may select in their
sole and absolute discretion may assume control of (A) the management or the
operation of the Eligible Projects, the related amenities, the Additional Resort
Collateral and any other Collateral as the Required Banks may in their sole
discretion deem necessary and (B) the monitoring or supervising of the
marketing, sales, resales, and financings of the Timeshare Interests pledged to
the Agent, reporting to the Banks, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. Upon an Event of Default, at the election of the Required Banks, the
Borrower agrees that the Standby Servicer or such other servicer as the Required
Banks may select in their sole and absolute discretion may assume control over
the servicing of the Consumer Loan Collateral or any other consumer loans
pledged to the Agent, reporting to the Banks. The Agent shall also have the
right, but not the obligation, to assume management of the Eligible Projects,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

         12.5. DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.5(b) and (c)

                  the Banks in connection with the collection of such monies by

                  Tranche A Commitment (if then in effect) in the amount of such
                  repayment);

                           (vi) Sixth, to pay the interest on the Tranche A
                  Loans of the Tranche A Banks (other than Sovereign) and to pay
                  interest on the Tranche B Loans of the Tranche B Banks (other
                  than Sovereign) and to pay any other Obligations (other than
                  the principal of the Loans) then due and payable to the Banks
                  (other than Sovereign);

                           (vii) Seventh, to pay the principal of the Tranche A
                  Loans of the other Tranche A Banks (it being understood that
                  such repayment shall be accompanied by a permanent reduction
                  in the Tranche A Total Commitment (if then in effect) in the
                  amount of such repayment);

                           (viii) Eighth, to pay the principal of the Tranche B
                  Loans of the other Tranche B Banks (it being understood that
                  such repayment shall be accompanied by a permanent reduction
                  in the Tranche B Total Commitment (if then in effect) in the
                  amount of such repayment);

                           (ix) Ninth, upon payment and satisfaction in full or
                  other provisions for payment in full satisfactory to the Banks
                  and the Agent of all of the Obligations, to the payment of any
                  obligations required to be paid pursuant to Section
                  9-608(a)(i)(c) or 9-615(a)(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code;
                  and

                           (x) Tenth, the excess, if any, shall be returned to
                  the Borrower or to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

                  (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.5(a), (b) and
         (c) above, with respect to each type of Obligation owing to the Banks,
         such as interest, principal, fees and expenses, all payments shall be
         made to the Banks pro rata.

         12.6. RELIEF FROM AUTOMATIC STAY, ETC. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, in the event the Borrower shall make any application for or seek relief
or protection under the federal bankruptcy code (the "BANKRUPTCY CODE") or other
Debtor Relief Laws, or in the event that any involuntary petition is filed
against the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Debtor Relief Law,
and not dismissed with prejudice within 45 days, the Borrower agrees that the
automatic stay provisions of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code shall be
modified to permit set-off and the Borrower agrees that the Agent and each Bank
automatically and without demand or notice (each of which is hereby waived)
shall be entitled to immediate relief from any automatic stay imposed by Section
362 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, on or against the exercise of the
rights and remedies otherwise available to the Agent and the Banks as provided
in the Loan Documents.

                                   13. SETOFF.

         Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral, during the continuance of
any


<PAGE>
                                       93


Event of Default, any deposits or other sums credited by or due from any of the
Banks to the Borrower and any securities or other property of the Borrower in
the possession of such Bank may be applied to or set off by such Bank against
the payment of Obligations and any and all other liabilities, direct, or
indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, now existing or
hereafter arising, of the Borrower to such Bank. Each of the Banks agrees with
each other Bank that (i) if an amount to be set off is to be applied to
Indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank, other than Indebtedness evidenced by
the Notes held by such Bank, such amount shall be applied ratably to such other
Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness evidenced by all such Notes held by such
Bank, and (ii) if such Bank shall receive from the Borrower, whether by
voluntary payment, exercise of the right of setoff, counterclaim, cross action,
enforcement of the claim evidenced by the Notes held by such Bank by proceedings
against the Borrower at law or in equity or by proof thereof in bankruptcy,
reorganization, liquidation, receivership or similar proceedings, or otherwise,
and shall retain and apply to the payment of the Note or Notes held by such Bank
any amount in excess of its ratable portion of the payments received by all of
the Banks with respect to the Notes held by all of the Banks, such Bank will
make such disposition and arrangements with the other Banks with respect to such
excess, either by way of distribution, pro tanto assignment of claims,
subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Bank receiving in respect of
the Notes held by it its proportionate payment as contemplated by this Credit
Agreement; provided that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such Bank, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded
and the amount restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

                                 14. THE AGENT.

         14.1. AUTHORIZATION.

                  (a) The Agent is authorized to take such action on behalf of
         each of the Banks and to exercise all such powers as are hereunder and
         under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents
         delegated to the Agent, together with such powers as are reasonably
         incident thereto, provided that no duties or responsibilities not
         expressly assumed herein or therein shall be implied to have been
         assumed by the Agent. Each Bank hereby authorizes the Agent to hold and
         exercise control over the Consumer Loan Collateral and to exercise
         discretion with regard to the acceptance of Consumer Loan Collateral
         and the inclusion of Consumer Loan Collateral in the Borrowing Base
         from time to time.

                  (b) The relationship between the Agent and each of the Banks
         is that of an independent contractor. The use of the term "Agent" is
         for convenience only and is used to describe, as a form of convention,
         the independent contractual relationship between the Agent and each of
         the Banks. Nothing contained in this Credit Agreement nor the other
         Loan Documents shall be construed to create an agency, trust or other
         fiduciary relationship between the Agent and any of the Banks.


<PAGE>
                                       94


                  (c) As an independent contractor empowered by the Banks to
         exercise certain rights and perform certain duties and responsibilities
         hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Agent is nevertheless
         a "representative" of the Banks, as that term is defined in Article 1
         of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of actions for the benefit
         of the Banks and the Agent with respect to all collateral security and
         guaranties contemplated by the Loan Documents. Such actions include the
         designation of the Agent as "secured party", "mortgagee" or the like on
         all financing statements and other documents and instruments, whether
         recorded or otherwise, relating to the attachment, perfection, priority
         or enforcement of any security interests, mortgages or deeds of trust
         in collateral security intended to secure the payment or performance of
         any of the Obligations, all for the benefit of the Banks and the Agent.

                  (d) Each of the Banks and the Borrower hereby acknowledges the
         terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and further acknowledges that
         certain rights and remedies hereunder (including those set forth in
         Sections 3.2(c) and 12.4 hereof) are subject to the terms of the
         Intercreditor Agreement. Each of the Banks hereby authorizes the Agent
         to execute, deliver and perform the Intercreditor Agreement in its
         capacity as Agent for the Banks. The Agent and the Banks hereby agree
         that Agent shall act, or refrain from acting, as a "Lender" under the
         Intercreditor Agreement at the direction of the Required Banks (except
         that the Agent may act, or refrain from acting, with respect to the
         Existing Mortgaged Property solely at the direction of Sovereign), and
         that all amounts received by the Agent under the Intercreditor
         Agreement shall be applied to the Obligations in accordance with the
         terms of this Credit Agreement.

         14.2. GENERAL; EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. The Agent may exercise its powers
and execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled
to take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
its rights and duties under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
The Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as the Agent in its sole
discretion may reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any
such Persons shall be paid by the Borrower.

         14.3. NO LIABILITY. Neither the Agent nor any of its shareholders,
directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their
duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver,
consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good
faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any
oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Agent or such other
Person, as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to its willful
misconduct or gross negligence. Subject to the preceding sentence, in the
administration of the Loans and the custody of the Collateral, the Agent shall
exercise the same standard of care as it exercises with loans where it is the
sole lender.


<PAGE>
                                       95


         14.4. NO REPRESENTATIONS.

                  14.4.1. GENERAL. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
         execution or validity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement, the
         Notes, any of the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time
         constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the
         Notes, or for the value of any such collateral security or for the
         validity, enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing
         with respect to the Notes, or for any recitals or statements,
         warranties or representations made herein or in any of the other Loan
         Documents or in any certificate or instrument hereafter furnished to it
         by or on behalf of the Borrower, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as
         to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions,
         covenants or agreements herein or in any instrument at any time
         constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the
         Notes or to inspect any of the properties, books or records of the
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Agent shall not be bound to
         ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to
         it by the Borrower or any holder of any of the Notes shall have been
         duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete. The Agent has not
         made nor does it now make any representations or warranties, express or
         implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Banks, with respect to
         the credit worthiness or financial conditions of the Borrower or any of
         its Subsidiaries. Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and
         without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based upon such
         information and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
         credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement.

                  14.4.2. CONSUMER LOAN COLLATERAL.

                  The Agent shall be under no obligation to review or in any
         manner approve any Consumer Loan Collateral delivered to the Agent from
         time to time, although nothing herein shall preclude the Agent from
         conducting whatever review it deems appropriate. The Agent shall have
         no responsibility for taking any steps necessary to preserve rights
         against other parties or any other rights pertaining to Collateral. The
         Agent shall not be required to perfect or maintain the perfection of
         its security interests. No loss of or damage to any Collateral shall
         release the Borrower from the Indebtedness. The Agent may, but shall
         not be obligated to, take such action as it deems fit, at the
         Borrower's expense, to collect or enforce any loan pledged to the Agent
         hereunder which shall be in default and the Agent shall not be liable
         to the Borrower for any act or omission taken by it in the collection
         or enforcement of such loans. The Agent shall not be liable or
         responsible in any way for any loss or damage to the Collateral or any
         diminution in the value thereof, except if caused by the Agent's gross
         negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall not be liable or
         responsible in any way for any act of any custodian, carrier, servicer,
         lock box agent or any other Person whatsoever, and all of the same
         shall be at the Borrower's sole risk. The Agent and the Banks shall not
         be responsible for any excise, property or other taxes related to the
         Collateral or the sale thereof and all such taxes shall be the

<PAGE>
                                       96


         responsibility of the Borrower. The grants of security interests under
         the Security Documents shall not obligate or be construed to obligate
         the Agent to perform any of the terms contained in the agreements
         constituting Collateral or otherwise to impose any duty upon the Agent
         with respect to the same.

                  14.4.3. CLOSING DOCUMENTATION, ETC. For purposes of
         determining compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 10,
         each Bank that has executed this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to
         have consented to, approved or accepted, or to be satisfied with, each
         document and matter either sent, or made available, by the Agent to
         such Bank for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or
         required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
         satisfactory to such Bank.

         14.5. PAYMENTS.

                  14.5.1. PAYMENTS TO AGENT. A payment by the Borrower to the
         Agent hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents for the account of
         any Bank shall constitute a payment to such Bank. The Agent agrees
         promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after receipt
         to distribute to each Bank such Bank's pro rata share of payments
         received by the Agent for the account of the Banks except as otherwise
         expressly provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents. If the
         Agent does not so distribute within two (2) Business Days any such
         payment received by it for the account of any Bank, the Agent shall pay
         to such Bank on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the
         average computed for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of
         the weighted average interest rate paid by such Bank for federal funds
         acquired by such Bank during each day included in such period, times
         (ii) the amount of such payment for the account of such Bank, times
         (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that
         elapse from and including the date which is two Business Days after the
         Agent received such payment to the date on which such payment is made
         to such Bank, and the denominator of which is 365.

                  14.5.2. DISTRIBUTION BY AGENT. If in the reasonable opinion of
         the Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in such
         capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other Loan
         Documents might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making
         distribution until its right to make distribution shall have been
         adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of
         competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and
         distributed by the Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any such
         distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the Agent its
         proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay
         over the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined
         by such court.

                  14.5.3. DELINQUENT BANKS. Notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary contained in this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan

<PAGE>
                                       97


         Documents, any Bank that fails (i) to make available to the Agent its
         pro rata share of any Loan required to be funded by such Bank or (ii)
         to comply with the provisions of Section 13 with respect to making
         dispositions and arrangements with the other Banks, where such Bank's
         share of any payment received, whether by setoff or otherwise, is in
         excess of its pro rata share of such payments due and payable to all of
         the Banks, in each case as, when and to the full extent required by the
         provisions of this Credit Agreement, shall be deemed delinquent (a
         "DELINQUENT BANK") and shall be deemed a Delinquent Bank until such
         time as such delinquency is satisfied. A Delinquent Bank shall be
         deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the
         Borrower, whether on account of outstanding Loans, interest, fees or
         otherwise, to the remaining nondelinquent Banks for application to, and
         reduction of, their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding
         Loans. The Delinquent Bank hereby authorizes the Agent to distribute
         such payments to the nondelinquent Banks in proportion to their
         respective pro rata shares of all outstanding Loans. A Delinquent Bank
         shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency when and if, as
         a result of application of the assigned payments to all outstanding
         Loans of the nondelinquent Banks, the Banks' respective pro rata shares
         of all outstanding Loans have returned to those in effect immediately
         prior to such delinquency and without giving effect to the nonpayment
         causing such delinquency.

         14.6. HOLDERS OF NOTES. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any
Note as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have
been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent
holder.

         14.7. INDEMNITY. The Banks ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold
harmless the Agent and its affiliates from and against any and all claims,
actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs,
expenses (including any expenses for which the Agent or such affiliate has not
been reimbursed by the Borrower as required by Section 15), and liabilities of
every nature and character arising out of or related to this Credit Agreement,
the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
or evidenced hereby or thereby, or the Agent's actions taken hereunder or
thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused
by the Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

         14.8. AGENT AS BANK. In its individual capacity, Sovereign shall have
the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to
its Commitment and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the Notes,
as it would have were it not also the Agent.

         14.9. RESIGNATION; REMOVAL. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower. The
Required Banks (determined without regard to Notes and Commitments held by the
Bank which is the Agent) may remove the Agent upon 30 days' prior notice to the
Agent after the occurrence of one of the following (unless cured within the 30
day period): (a) a material uncured default by the Agent in the performance of
its duties;


<PAGE>
                                       98


(b) the failure of the Agent, as a Bank, to advance its pro-rata share of the
Loans in accordance with this Credit Agreement; or (c) the appointment of a
receiver for the Agent or the assumption of the Agent's operations by any
federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the Agent. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent. Unless a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, such successor Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.
If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and
shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring
Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf
of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a financial institution
having a rating of not less than A or its equivalent by Standard & Poor's
Corporation. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation, the provisions of this Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as Agent.

         14.10. NOTIFICATION OF DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT NOTICES. Each
Bank hereby agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event
of Default, it shall promptly notify the Agent thereof. The Agent hereby agrees
that (a) upon receipt of any notice under this Section 14.10, or (b) if
Sovereign is the Agent, upon Sovereign's obtaining actual knowledge of the
existence of a Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly notify the other
Banks of the existence of such Default or Event of Default. The Agent hereby
agrees that it will promptly distribute to the Banks, all Loan Requests, reports
and other information delivered to it under Section 7.4, notices delivered to it
under Section 7.5, other notices and information delivered to the Agent
hereunder for distribution to the Banks, and all material notices sent or
received by the Agent with respect to the Intercreditor Agreement.

                        15. EXPENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION.

         15.1. EXPENSES. The Borrower agrees to pay (i) the reasonable costs of
producing and reproducing this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and
the other agreements and instruments mentioned herein, (ii) any taxes (including
any interest and penalties in respect thereto) payable by the Agent or any of
the Banks (other than taxes based upon the Agent's or any Bank's net income) on

Borrower hereby agreeing to indemnify the Agent and each Bank with respect
thereto), (iii) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of the Agent's
Special Counsel, any local counsel to the Agent and counsel to each Bank
incurred in connection with the preparation, syndication, administration or
interpretation of the Loan Documents and other instruments mentioned herein, the

Collateral; (vi) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, which attorneys may be

incurred by any Bank or the Agent in connection with (A) the interpretation,
enforcement of or preservation of rights under any of the Loan Documents against
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the administration thereof after the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default and (B) any litigation, proceeding
or dispute whether arising hereunder or otherwise, in any way related to any
Bank's or the Agent's relationship with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
(vii) all reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any Bank or the Agent
incurred in connection with UCC searches, UCC filings or mortgage recordings,
(viii) the fees and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) of the

to the terms of the Loan Documents.

         15.2. INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Agent, its affiliates and the Banks (and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, representatives, agents and attorneys) from and

         All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made herein,
in the Notes, in any of the other Loan Documents or in any documents or other
papers delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries

due under this Credit Agreement or the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents
remains outstanding or any Bank has any obligation to make any Loans, and for
such further time as may be otherwise expressly specified in this Credit
Agreement. All statements contained in any certificate or other paper delivered

         representation or warranty, express or implied, and assumes no
         responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or

         upon the assigning Bank, the Agent or any other Bank and based on such
         documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,

<PAGE>
                                      102


                  (e) such assignee represents and warrants that it is an
         Eligible Assignee;

                  (f) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
         such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under
         this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to
         the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as
         are reasonably incidental thereto;

                  (g) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance
         with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this
         Credit Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank; and

                  (h) such assignee represents and warrants that it is legally
         authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance.

         17.3. REGISTER. The Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to it and a register or similar list (the "REGISTER'") for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Tranche A
Commitment Percentage and Tranche B Commitment Percentage of, and principal
amount of the Tranche A Loans and the Tranche B Loans owing to the Banks from
time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of
this Credit Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower and the Banks at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

         17.4. NEW NOTES. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by the parties to such assignment, together with each Note subject to
such assignment, the Agent shall (i) record the information contained therein in
the Register, and (ii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks
(other than the assigning Bank). Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of
such notice, the Borrower, at its, own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Agent, in exchange for each surrendered Note or Notes, a new Note or Notes to
the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the amount assumed by
such Eligible Assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the
assigning Bank has retained some portion of its obligations hereunder, a new
Note or Notes to the order of the assigning Bank in an amount equal to the
amount retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall provide that they are
replacements for the surrendered Notes, shall be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the surrendered Notes, shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be in substantially the form of the assigned Notes. Within five (5)
days of issuance of any new Notes pursuant to this Section 17.4, the Borrower

         17.5. PARTICIPATIONS. Each Bank may sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided
that (i) each such participation shall be in an amount of not less than
$5,000,000, (ii) any such sale or participation shall not affect the rights and
duties of the selling Bank hereunder to the Borrower and (iii) the only rights
granted to the participant pursuant to such participation arrangements with
respect to waivers, amendments or modifications of the Loan Documents shall be
the rights to approve waivers, amendments or modifications that would reduce the
principal of or the interest rate on Loans, only to the extent such participant
has an interest in such Loans, extend the term or increase the amount of the
Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment of such Bank as it relates to such
participant or extend any regularly scheduled payment date for principal or
interest on any Loans in which the participant has acquired an interest.

         17.6. DISCLOSURE. The Borrower agrees that in addition to disclosures
made in accordance with standard and customary banking practices any Bank may
disclose information obtained by such Bank pursuant to this Credit Agreement to
assignees or participants and potential assignees or participants hereunder;
provided that such assignees or participants or potential assignees or
participants shall agree (i) to treat in confidence such information unless such
information otherwise becomes public knowledge, (ii) not to disclose such
information to a third party, except as required by law or legal process and
(iii) not to make use of such information for purposes of transactions unrelated
to such contemplated assignment or participation. For purposes of this Section
17.6 an assignee or participant or potential assignee or participant may include
a counterparty with whom such Bank has entered into or potentially might enter
into a derivative contract referenced to credit or other risks or events arising
under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         17.7. ASSIGNEE OR PARTICIPANT AFFILIATED WITH THE BORROWER. If any
assignee Bank is an Affiliate of the Borrower, then any such assignee Bank shall
have no right to vote as a Bank hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of
agreeing to amendments or other modifications to any of the Loan Documents or
for purposes of making requests to the Agent pursuant to Section 12.1 or Section
12.2, and the determination of the Required Banks shall for all purposes of this
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents be made without regard to such
assignee Bank's interest in any of the Loans. If any Bank sells a participating
interest in any of the Loans to a participant, and such participant is the
Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower, then such transferor Bank shall
promptly notify the Agent of the sale of such participation. A transferor Bank
shall have no right to vote as a Bank hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of
agreeing to amendments or modifications to any of the Loan Documents or for
purposes of making requests to the Agent pursuant to Section 12.1 or


<PAGE>
                                      104


Section 12.2 to the extent that such participation is beneficially owned by the
Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower, and the determination of the Required
Banks shall for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents be made without regard to the interest of such transferor Bank in the
Loans to the extent of such participation.

         17.8. MISCELLANEOUS ASSIGNMENT PROVISIONS. Any assigning Bank shall
retain its rights to be indemnified pursuant to Section 15 with respect to any
claims or actions arising prior to the date of such assignment. If any assignee
Bank is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any
state thereof, it shall, prior to the date on which any interest or fees are
payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents for its account,
deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to its exemption from
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Anything
contained in this Section 17 to the contrary notwithstanding, any Bank may at
any time pledge all or any portion of its interest and rights under this Credit
Agreement (including all or any portion of its Notes) to any of the twelve
Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12
U.S.C. Section 341. No such pledge or the enforcement thereof shall release the
pledgor Bank from its obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents.

         17.9. ASSIGNMENT BY BORROWER. The Borrower shall not assign or transfer
any of its rights or obligations under any of the Loan Documents without the
prior written consent of each of the Banks.

         (a)      the principal amount of or the rate of interest on the Notes
                  (other than interest accruing pursuant to Section 4.7.2
                  following the effective date of any waiver by all of the Banks

         (e)      a substantial amount of the Collateral (other than the
                  Existing Mortgaged Properties) may not be released (other than
                  any release specifically provided for herein) without the
                  written consent of all of the Banks;

         (f)      the Intercreditor Agreement may not be amended without the
                  written consent of all of the Banks (other than any amendment

                  may be approved by Sovereign in its sole discretion) and to
                  the extent that the Agent is agreeing to or consenting with
                  any action or waiver under the Intercreditor Agreement (other

                  Mortgaged Properties, which may be approved by Sovereign in
                  its sole discretion), the Agent shall consult with all of the
                  Banks prior thereto and shall agree or consent (or not agree
                  or consent) as directed by all of the Banks;

         (g)      no Tranche A Loan shall be made during the continuance of an
                  Event of Default without the written consent of all of the
                  Banks;

         (h)      neither the Tranche A Maturity Date nor the Tranche B Maturity
                  Date may be postponed without the written consent of all of
                  the Banks;

         (i)      this Section 24 and the definition of Required Banks may not
                  be amended without the written consent of all of the Banks;

         (j)      none of Section 7.4, Section 9, or Section 11 may be amended

                  the Banks;

         (k)      the Borrower may not amend the Business Plan in any material
                  respect without the written consent of all of the Banks;

         (l)      no Event of Default may be waived by the Banks, and no
                  provision of any Loan Document may be amended for the purpose
                  of curing any Event of Default, in each case without the
                  written consent of all of the Banks; and

         (m)      Section 14 may not be amended without the written consent of
                  the Agent.

No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or
impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission
on the part of any Bank in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver
thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice to or demand upon the
Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances.

                                25. SEVERABILITY.

         The provisions of this Credit Agreement are severable and if any one

part in any

clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and shall not in any
manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or any other
clause or provision of this Credit Agreement in any jurisdiction.

              26. NONCONSOLIDATION WITH SILVERLEAF FINANCE I, INC.

transfer of receivables from the Borrower to SFI or commence or join with others
in commencing an involuntary bankruptcy of SFI.

                         27. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.

         This Credit Agreement shall supersede the Original Agreement in its
entirety, except as provided in this Section 27. On the Closing Date, the rights
and obligations of the parties under the Original Agreement and the "Notes"
defined therein shall be subsumed within and be governed by this Credit
Agreement and the Notes; provided however, that any of the "Loans" (as defined
in Original Agreement) outstanding under the Original Agreement shall, for
purposes of this Credit Agreement, be Loans hereunder. Upon its receipt of the
Notes to be delivered hereunder on the Closing Date, each Bank will promptly
return to the Borrower, marked "Cancelled" or "Replaced", the notes of the
Borrower held by such Bank pursuant to the Original Agreement. All interest and
all commitment, facility and other fees and expenses owing or accruing under or
in respect of the Original Agreement shall be calculated as of the Closing Date
(prorated in the case of any fractional periods), and shall be paid on the
Closing Date in accordance with the method specified in the Original Agreement,
as if the Original Agreement were still in effect.

                                  28. RELEASE.

         In order to induce the Agent and the Banks to enter into this
Agreement, the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Borrower has no
claim or cause of action against the Agent or any Bank (or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents); (ii) the Borrower has no
offset right, counterclaim or defense of any kind against any of its
obligations, indebtedness or liabilities to the Agent or any Bank; and (iii)
each of the Agent and the Banks has heretofore properly performed and satisfied
in a timely manner all of its obligations to the Borrower. The Borrower wishes
to eliminate any possibility that any past conditions, acts, omissions, events,
circumstances or matters would impair or otherwise adversely affect the Agent's
or any of the Banks' rights, interests, contracts, collateral security or
remedies. Therefore, the Borrower unconditionally releases, waives and forever
discharges (A) any and all liabilities, obligations, duties, promises or
indebtedness of

any kind of the Agent or any Bank to the Borrower, except the obligations to be
performed by the Agent or any Bank on or after the date hereof as expressly
stated in this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (B) all
claims, offsets, causes of action, suits or defenses of any kind whatsoever (if
any), whether arising at law or in equity, whether known or unknown, which the
Borrower might otherwise have against the Agent, any Bank or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents, in either case (A) or (B),
on account of any past or presently existing condition, act, omission, event,
contract, liability, obligation, indebtedness, claim, cause of action, defense,
circumstance or matter of any kind.

                                   29. WAIVER.

         On the Closing Date, so long as each condition precedent set forth in
this Agreement has been satisfied, the Banks agree to waive all prior Defaults
and Events of Default under the Original Agreement, including, but not limited
to the Specified Events of Default (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement).
For the avoidance of any doubt, the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing waiver shall not extend to any Default
or Event of Default that may exist or occur on or after the Closing Date under
this Agreement.
