<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), is entered into as of June&nbsp;27, 2005, by and
between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), and
Martin J. Sullivan (&#147;<U>Executive</U>&#148;).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Executive is currently employed by the Company as its President and Chief Executive
Officer pursuant to that certain employment letter dated as of March&nbsp;16, 2005 (the &#147;<U>Employment
Letter</U>&#148;); and



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, the Company wishes to continue Executive&#146;s
employment as President and Chief Executive Officer under the terms of a new employment agreement
on the terms set forth herein, which shall supersede the Employment Letter; and



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Executive desires to enter into such agreement; and



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Executive&#146;s employment as the Company&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer is a
promotion from his position with the Company prior to March&nbsp;14, 2005, and the Board of Directors of
the Company (the &#147;<U>Board</U>&#148;) has acknowledged that Executive has been performing his duties as
President and Chief Executive Officer under conditions at the Company that are demanding both in
terms of the time commitment required and the unique circumstances facing the Company as of the
date of this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein and for other
good and valuable consideration, the parties hereby agree as follows:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <U>Term of Employment</U>. Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;9 of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall be effective for a term commencing as of March&nbsp;14, 2005 (the &#147;<U>Effective
Date</U>&#148;) and ending on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Effective Date
(the &#147;<U>Employment Term</U>&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Executive shall serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In such
position, Executive shall have such duties and authority as are consistent therewith. Executive
shall report to the Board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;During the Employment Term, Executive will devote his full business time and best efforts
to the performance of his duties hereunder and will not engage in any other business, profession or
occupation for compensation or otherwise which would conflict or interfere with the rendition of
such services, either directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Board;
provided, that nothing herein shall preclude Executive, subject to the prior approval of the Board,
from accepting appointment to or continuing to serve on any board of directors or trustees of any
business corporation or any charitable or not-for-profit organization or from managing his
personal, financial and legal affairs; provided, in each case,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">and in the aggregate, that such activities do not conflict or interfere with the performance
of Executive&#146;s duties hereunder or conflict with Section&nbsp;11 of this Agreement in any material
respect.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <U>Base Salary and Non-Variable Compensation</U>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Base Salary</U>. During the Employment Term, the Company shall pay Executive a base
salary (the &#147;<U>Base Salary</U>&#148;) at the annual rate of $1,000,000, payable in regular
installments in accordance with the Company&#146;s usual payroll practices. The Base Salary shall be
retroactive to the Effective Date. During the Employment Term, the Compensation Committee of the
Board (the &#147;<U>Compensation Committee</U>&#148;) shall review the Base Salary annually and may increase
the Base Salary, and the term &#147;Base Salary&#148; shall refer to such increased amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Non-Variable Compensation</U>. Executive shall receive an additional cash payment
with respect to each of fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007, in addition to any other amounts
described in this Agreement, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) $1,125,000 over (ii)
the aggregate of all (A)&nbsp;supplemental quarterly interim cash bonuses in respect of the Company&#146;s
long-term compensation arrangements or otherwise paid in respect of the applicable fiscal year,
which shall be paid consistent with past practice, (B)&nbsp;payments, if any, during the applicable
fiscal year for service as a director of C.V. Starr &#038; Co., Inc. (&#147;<U>Starr</U>&#148;) and Starr
International Company, Inc. and (C)&nbsp;cash dividends received in respect of the fiscal year, or with
respect to the prior fiscal year to the extent not previously taken into account in respect of this
clause (C), on common and preferred stock of Starr held by Executive, which compensation shall be
paid no later than March&nbsp;31 of the fiscal year following each of fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007.
This amount shall be payable in respect of fiscal year 2007 irrespective of the expiration of the
Employment Term on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Effective Date, if
such amount has not been paid by such time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <U>Bonuses</U>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Transition Bonus</U>. The Company shall pay Executive a transition bonus, in cash, in
an amount equal to $4,875,000 (the &#147;<U>Transition Bonus</U>&#148;), which shall be paid in four equal
installments on, or as soon as reasonably practicable following, each of the following dates,
whether or not Executive is employed by the Company on such dates, unless Executive&#146;s employment
has been terminated by the Company for &#147;Cause&#148; or by Executive without &#147;Good Reason&#148; (as such terms
are defined below): (i)&nbsp;the date Executive and the Company sign this Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;the last
day of each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of the Company in 2005. If Executive&#146;s
employment is terminated for any reason other than by the Company for Cause or by Executive without
Good Reason before any payment date set forth in the preceding sentence, then, if necessary to
avoid the application of Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), to any such unpaid portion of the Transition Bonus, Executive shall not receive
any such amounts until the first scheduled payroll date that occurs more than six months following
the date of termination of employment (the &#147;<U>First Payment Date</U>&#148;) and, on the First Payment
Date, the Company will pay Executive an amount equal to the sum of all amounts that would have been
payable following termination of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">employment in respect of the period preceding the First Payment Date but for the delay imposed
on account of the aforementioned Section&nbsp;409A.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Annual Bonus</U>. Executive may receive an additional annual cash bonus in respect of
each full or partial fiscal year of the Company during the Employment Term, as determined in the
sole discretion of the Compensation Committee based on its assessment of Company and individual
performance in relation to performance targets, a subjective evaluation of Executive&#146;s performance
and/or such other criteria as may be established by it (the &#147;<U>Annual Bonus</U>&#148;).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Employment Term, Executive shall be eligible, with
respect to each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007, for an annual cash bonus based on the attainment of
targets established by the Compensation Committee, which, together with the target value of any
long-term or equity-based award in respect of such year (as described in Section&nbsp;5), shall have a
total target value of $12,875,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <U>Long-Term and Equity-Based Incentives</U>. During the Employment Term, Executive shall
be eligible to participate in any long-term incentive compensation plans or equity-based
compensation plans maintained by the Company on such basis as may be determined by the Compensation
Committee; provided that, as of a date that is not later than March&nbsp;31, 2006, Executive shall be
granted awards in respect of fiscal year 2005 having a value, determined at the date of grant, as
reasonably determined by the Compensation Committee, of no less than the excess of (A) $8,000,000
over (B)&nbsp;the sum of (i)&nbsp;the grant date value (as reasonably determined by the Compensation
Committee in the same manner) of Company stock options and other equity awards granted to Executive
no later than December&nbsp;31, 2005, in respect of fiscal year 2005, (ii)&nbsp;the annualized fiscal year
2005 grant value (as reasonably determined by the Compensation Committee) of any award made to
Executive pursuant to a Company arrangement intended to be in lieu of Executive&#146;s participation in
the Starr International Company, Inc. Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan and (iii)&nbsp;the
value (as reasonably determined by the Compensation Committee) of any additional shares of
preferred stock awarded to Executive with respect to fiscal year 2005 by Starr and any growth in
book value in respect of 2005 attributable to any common stock of Starr held by Executive. In the
event that any shares pursuant to clause (iii)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence have not been awarded, or
increase in book value determined, by Starr by March&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company shall grant Executive a
long-term or equity-based award having a value, as reasonably determined by the Compensation
Committee, equal to the excess of (X) $8,000,000 over (Y)&nbsp;the value of the awards described in
clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section&nbsp;5, during the Employment Term, Executive shall be eligible, with respect to each of fiscal
years 2006 and 2007, for a long-term or equity-based award, which, together with any annual cash
bonus target in respect of such year (as described in Section&nbsp;4(b)), shall have a total target
value (as reasonably determined by the Compensation Committee) of $12,875,000. The amount actually
awarded in respect of 2006 and 2007 shall be offset by the value of (I)&nbsp;awards described in clause
(B)&nbsp;of the first sentence of this Section&nbsp;5, but substituting 2006 or 2007, as applicable, for 2005
in such clause and (II)&nbsp;any shares awarded, or increase in book value determined, in accordance
with such clause (B)&nbsp;in respect of the applicable year but later than March&nbsp;31 of the subsequent
year.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <U>Employee Benefits</U>. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be entitled to
participate in the Company&#146;s employee benefit plans (other than any severance or change-in-control

limitation, the provision of financial and tax planning assistance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <U>Termination</U>. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>For Cause by the Company</U>. The Employment Term, and Executive&#146;s employment
hereunder, may be terminated at any time by the Company for Cause upon delivery of a &#147;Notice of
Termination&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;9(f)) by the Company to Executive. For purposes of this
Agreement, &#147;<U>Cause</U>&#148; shall mean, whether occurring prior to, or on or after the Effective
Date, (i)&nbsp;Executive&#146;s willful and continued failure to perform substantially his duties with the
Company (other than any such failure resulting from Executive&#146;s incapacity due to physical or
mental illness) for a period of 10&nbsp;days after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to Executive by the Board, which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board
believes that Executive has not substantially performed Executive&#146;s duties, (ii)&nbsp;Executive&#146;s
willful malfeasance or willful misconduct that results in substantial damage to the Company, (iii)

Agreement, or (vi)&nbsp;Executive&#146;s breach of Section&nbsp;14 of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act on the part of Executive, shall be
considered &#147;willful&#148; unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in bad faith or without
reasonable belief that Executive&#146;s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.
Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the
Board or upon the instructions of the Board or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company
shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">done, by Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of
employment of Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a simple
majority of the members of the Board (other than Executive, if he is a member of the Board) at a
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to
Executive, and Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the
Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, Executive is guilty of the conduct
described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v)&nbsp;or (vi)&nbsp;above, and specifying the particulars thereof in
detail; provided, that, no such resolution shall be required for any termination for Cause due to
the conduct described in clause (iv)&nbsp;above.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Executive is terminated for Cause pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9(a), he shall be entitled to
receive only his Base Salary through the date of termination and reimbursement for any unreimbursed
business expenses properly incurred by Executive in accordance with Company policy through the date
of Executive&#146;s termination, and he shall have no further rights to any compensation (including any
Base Salary, Transition Bonus, Annual Bonus (including any Annual Bonus that has been declared but
not yet paid), payments from the Company pursuant to Section 3(b) of this Agreement or any
long-term or equity-based compensation awards) or any other benefits under this Agreement. All
other benefits, if any, due Executive following Executive&#146;s termination of employment for Cause
pursuant to this Section 9(a) shall be determined in accordance with the plans, policies and
practices of the Company; provided, however, that Executive shall not participate in any severance
plan, policy or program of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Disability or Death</U>. The Employment Term, and Executive&#146;s employment hereunder,
shall terminate immediately upon Executive&#146;s death or following delivery of a Notice of Termination
by the Company to Executive if Executive becomes physically or mentally incapacitated and is
therefore unable for a period of ninety (90)&nbsp;consecutive days or one-hundred twenty (120)&nbsp;days
during any consecutive six (6)&nbsp;month period to perform his duties with substantially the same level
of quality as immediately prior to such incapacity (such incapacity is hereinafter referred to as
&#147;<U>Disability</U>&#148;). Upon termination of Executive&#146;s employment hereunder for either Disability
or death, Executive or Executive&#146;s estate (as the case may be) shall be entitled to receive (i)&nbsp;his
Base Salary through the last day of the payroll period during which such termination occurs; (ii)
any declared but unpaid Annual Bonus for any fiscal year preceding the year in which the
termination occurs; (iii)&nbsp;reimbursement for any unreimbursed business expenses properly incurred by
Executive in accordance with Company policy through the date of Executive&#146;s termination (the sum of
(i), (ii)&nbsp;plus (iii), the &#147;<U>Accrued Obligations</U>&#148;); (iv)&nbsp;a pro rata portion of any Annual
Bonus that Executive would have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4(b) of this Agreement
with respect to the fiscal year of termination based upon the percentage of the fiscal year that
shall have elapsed through the date of Executive&#146;s termination of employment, and determined by
using (X)&nbsp;the Transition Bonus, if such termination occurs during fiscal year 2005, and reducing
the pro rata portion of the Transition Bonus by the aggregate amount of all installments of the
Transition Bonus that have been paid through the date of termination, or (Y)&nbsp;Executive&#146;s target
Annual Bonus for the fiscal year of such termination, if such termination occurs following the end
of fiscal year 2005 (the &#147;<U>Pro-Rata Bonus</U>&#148;), payable as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of Executive&#146;s

continuation of the Base Salary in effect on the date of termination until the earlier of (A)&nbsp;the
second anniversary of the date of termination, and (B)&nbsp;the date Executive is eligible to commence
receiving payments under the Company&#146;s long-term disability policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event of Executive&#146;s termination of employment due to Disability, if necessary to avoid the
application of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code to the amounts payable pursuant to clauses (iv)&nbsp;and (v)&nbsp;of
the preceding sentence, Executive shall not receive any such amounts until the First Payment Date
and, on the First Payment Date, the Company will pay Executive an amount equal to the sum of all
amounts that would have been payable in respect of the period preceding the First Payment Date but
for the delay imposed on account of the aforementioned Section&nbsp;409A. Executive or Executive&#146;s
estate (as the case may be) shall have no further rights to any compensation (including any Base
Salary, Annual Bonus, payments under Section&nbsp;3(b) of this Agreement or any long-term or
equity-based compensation awards) or any other benefits under this Agreement. All other benefits,
if any, due Executive following Executive&#146;s termination for Disability or death shall be determined
in accordance with the plans, policies and practices of the Company; provided, however, that
Executive (or his estate, as the case may be) shall not participate in any severance plan, policy
or program of the Company.

and Executive&#146;s employment hereunder, may be terminated by the Company without Cause (other than by
reason of Executive&#146;s Disability) following the delivery by the Company of a Notice of Termination
to Executive or by Executive for Good Reason following the delivery by Executive of a Notice of
Termination to the Company. The expiration of the Employment Term on the date immediately
preceding the third anniversary of the Effective Date shall not be considered a termination without
Cause under this Agreement or otherwise result in the payment of severance or post-employment
benefits pursuant to Section 9(c) of this Agreement if Executive is not otherwise terminated
pursuant to Section 9(c) of this Agreement prior to such date. If Executive&#146;s employment is
terminated by the Company without Cause (other than by reason of Disability) or by Executive for
Good Reason, Executive shall be entitled to receive:

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other
agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company, including without limitation any
restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the lapse or
termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a

successor provision thereto), or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest
or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest
and penalties, are hereafter collectively referred to as the &#147;<U>Excise Tax</U>&#148;), then the
Executive will be entitled to receive an additional payment or payments (a &#147;<U>Gross-Up
Payment</U>&#148;) in an amount such that, after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon
the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of Section 10(f) of this Agreement, all determinations required
to be made under this Section&nbsp;10, including whether an Excise Tax is payable by Executive and the
amount of such Excise Tax and whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such
Gross-Up Payment, will be made by a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants (the
&#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;) chosen by the Company. The Company will direct the Accounting Firm to
submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and Executive
within fifteen (15)&nbsp;calendar days after the date of the event giving rise to the Payment or the
date of Executive&#146;s termination of employment, if applicable, and any other such time or times as
may be requested by the Company or Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise
Tax is payable by Executive, the Company will pay the required Gross-Up Payment to Executive within
five (5)&nbsp;business days after receipt of such determination and calculations. If the Accounting
Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive, it will, at the same time as it makes
such determination, furnish Executive

state, local income or other tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm as to the amount
of the Gross-Up Payment will be binding upon the Company and Executive. As a result of the
uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) and
the possibility of similar uncertainty regarding applicable state or local tax law at the time of
any determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which
will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an &#147;<U>Underpayment</U>&#148;),
consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company
exhausts or fails to pursue its remedies pursuant to Section&nbsp;10(f) hereof and Executive thereafter
is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, Executive will direct the Accounting Firm to
determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and to submit its determination and
detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and Executive as promptly as possible. Any
such Underpayment will be promptly paid by the Company to, or for the benefit of, Executive within
five (5)&nbsp;business days after receipt of such determination and calculations.

any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company or Executive, as the case may be,
reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm in
connection with the preparation and issuance of the determination contemplated by Section 10(b) of
this Agreement.

prepared and filed on a consistent basis with the determination of the Accounting Firm with respect
to the Excise Tax payable by Executive. Executive will make proper payment of the amount of any
Excise Tax, and, at the request of the Company, provide to the Company true and correct copies
(with any amendments) of his federal income tax return as filed with the Internal Revenue Service
(the &#147;<U>IRS</U>&#148;) and corresponding state and local tax returns, if relevant, as filed with the
applicable taxing authority, and such other documents reasonably requested by the Company,
evidencing such payment. If prior to the filing of Executive&#146;s federal income tax return, or
corresponding state or local tax return, if relevant, the Accounting Firm determines that the
amount of the Gross-Up Payment should be reduced, Executive will, within five (5)&nbsp;business days pay
to the Company the amount of such reduction.

determinations and calculations contemplated by Section 10(b) and Section 10(d) of this Agreement
will be borne by the Company and paid as incurred. If such fees and expenses are initially
advanced by Executive, the Company will reimburse Executive the full amount of such fees and
expenses within five (5)&nbsp;business days after receipt from Executive of a statement therefor and
reasonable evidence of his payment thereof.

would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification will be given as
promptly as practicable but no later than ten (10)&nbsp;business days after Executive actually receives
notice of such claim and Executive will further apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and
the date on which such claim is requested to be paid (in each case, to the extent known by
Executive). Executive will not pay such claim prior to the

(including interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and will indemnify and
hold harmless Executive, on an after-tax basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax,
including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation
and payment of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
10(f), the Company will control all proceedings taken in connection with the contest of any claim
contemplated by this Section 10(f) and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect
of such claim (provided that Executive may participate therein at his own cost and expense) and
may, at its option, either direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest
the claim in any permissible manner, and Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a
determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or
more appellate courts, as the Company will determine; provided, that if the Company directs
Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Company will advance the amount of such
payment to Executive on an interest-free basis and will indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on
an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest or penalties with respect
thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and provided further, that any extension of the
statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of Executive with respect
to which the contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.
Furthermore, the Company&#146;s control of any such contested claim will be limited to issues with
respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and Executive will be entitled to
settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the IRS or any other taxing
authority.

made that Executive will not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>RELEASE OF CLAIMS</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1. <U>Release of Claims</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In partial consideration of the payments and benefits described in Section&nbsp;9 of the employment
agreement (the &#147;<U>Employment Agreement</U>&#148;), effective March&nbsp;14, 2005, by and between Martin J.
Sullivan (&#147;<U>Executive</U>&#148;) and American International Group, Inc. (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), to
which Executive agrees Executive is not entitled until and unless he executes this Release,
Executive, for and on behalf of himself and his heirs and assigns, subject to the following two
sentences hereof, hereby waives and releases any employment, compensation or benefit-related common
law, statutory or other complaints, claims, charges or causes of action of any kind whatsoever,
both known and unknown, in law or in equity, which Executive ever had, now has or may have against
the Company and its shareholders (other than C.V. Starr &#038; Co., Inc. and Starr International
Company, Inc.), subsidiaries, successors, assigns, directors, officers, partners, members,
employees or agents (collectively, the &#147;<U>Releasees</U>&#148;) by reason of facts or omissions which
have occurred on or prior to the date that Executive signs this Release, including, without
limitation, any complaint, charge or cause of action arising under federal, state or local laws
pertaining to employment, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
(&#147;<U>ADEA</U>,&#148; a law which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age), the National Labor
Relations Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all as amended; and all other federal, state and local laws and
regulations. By signing this Release, Executive acknowledges that he intends to waive and release
any rights known or unknown that he may have against the Releasees under these and any other laws;
provided, that Executive does not waive or release claims with respect to the right to enforce the
Employment Agreement (the &#147;<U>Unreleased Claims</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive
does not release, discharge or waive any rights to indemnification that he may have under the
certificate of incorporation, the by-laws or equivalent governing documents of the Company or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the laws of the State of Delaware or any other state of which such
subsidiary or affiliate is a domiciliary, or any indemnification agreement between Executive and
the Company, or any rights to insurance coverage under any directors&#146; and officers&#146; personal
liability insurance or fiduciary insurance policy.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive acknowledges that he has not filed any complaint, charge, claim or proceeding,
except with respect to an Unreleased Claim, if any, against any of the Releasees before any local,
state or federal agency, court or other body (each individually a
&#147;<u>Proceeding</u>&#148;). Executive
represents that he is not aware of any basis on which such a Proceeding could reasonably be
instituted. Executive (i)&nbsp;acknowledges that he will not initiate or cause to be initiated on his
behalf any Proceeding and will not participate in any Proceeding, in each case, except as required
by law; and (ii)&nbsp;waives any right he may have to benefit in any manner from any relief (whether
monetary or otherwise) arising out of any Proceeding, including any Proceeding conducted by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (&#147;<u>EEOC</u>&#148;). Further, Executive understands that, by
executing

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">this Release, he will be limiting the availability of certain remedies that he may have
against the Company and limiting also his ability to pursue certain claims against the Releasees.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing in Section&nbsp;1 of this Release shall prevent Executive from (i)
initiating or causing to be initiated on his behalf any complaint, charge, claim or proceeding
against the Company before any local, state or federal agency, court or other body challenging the
validity of the waiver of his claims under the ADEA contained in Section&nbsp;1 of this Release (but no
other portion of such waiver); or (ii)&nbsp;initiating or participating in an investigation or
proceeding conducted by the EEOC.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">3. <U>Time to Consider</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive acknowledges that he has been advised that he has twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days from the date
of receipt of this Release to consider all the provisions of this Release and he does hereby
knowingly and voluntarily waive said given twenty-one (21)&nbsp;day period. EXECUTIVE FURTHER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE HAS READ THIS RELEASE CAREFULLY, HAS BEEN ADVISED BY THE COMPANY TO, AND HAS
IN FACT, CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY, AND FULLY UNDERSTANDS THAT BY SIGNING BELOW HE IS GIVING UP CERTAIN
RIGHTS WHICH HE MAY HAVE TO SUE OR ASSERT A CLAIM AGAINST ANY OF THE RELEASEES, AS DESCRIBED IN
SECTION 1 OF THIS RELEASE AND THE OTHER PROVISIONS HEREOF. EXECUTIVE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE HAS NOT
BEEN FORCED OR PRESSURED IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER TO SIGN THIS RELEASE, AND EXECUTIVE AGREES TO ALL
OF ITS TERMS VOLUNTARILY.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">4. <U>Revocation</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive hereby acknowledges and understands that Executive shall have seven (7)&nbsp;days from
the date of his execution of this Release to revoke this Release (including, without limitation,
any and all claims arising under the ADEA) and that neither the Company nor any other person is
obligated to provide any benefits to Executive pursuant to Section&nbsp;9 of the Employment Agreement
until eight (8)&nbsp;days have passed since Executive&#146;s signing of this Release without Executive having
revoked this Release, in which event the Company immediately shall arrange and/or pay for any such
benefits otherwise attributable to said eight- (8)&nbsp;day period, consistent with the terms of the
Employment Agreement. If Executive revokes this Release, Executive will be deemed not to have
accepted the terms of this Release, and no action will be required of the Company under any section
of this Release.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">5. <U>No Admission</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Release does not constitute an admission of liability or wrongdoing of any kind by
Executive or the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A failure of any of the Releasees to insist on strict compliance with any provision of this
Release shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision or any other provision hereof. If any
provision of this Release is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, and in the event that any provision is
determined to be entirely unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed severable, such that all
other provisions of this Release shall remain valid and binding upon Executive and the Releasees.
