whatsoever, fulfilment of any provision hereof or of any of the agreements executed herewith at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of such
validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limits of such validity, and if under or from circumstances whatsoever the Lender
should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced
