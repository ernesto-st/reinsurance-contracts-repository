                           contractor shall notify the DMAHS sixty (60) days
                           before such change takes effect and provide written
                           copy of DOBI approval.

         H.       County Expansion Phase-In Plan. If the contractor does not
                  have an approved COA for each of the counties in a designated
                  region, the contractor shall submit to DMAHS a county
                  expansion phase-in plan for review and approval by DMAHS prior
                  to the execution of this contract. The plan shall include
                  detailed information of:

                  -        The region and names of the counties targeted for
                           expansion;

                  -        Anticipated dates of the submission of the COA

                  -        Anticipated date for initial beneficiary enrollment
                           in each county

                  The phase-in plan shall indicate that full expansion into a
                  region shall be completed by June 30, 2001. The contractor
                  shall maintain full coverage for each county in each region in
                  which the contractor operates for the duration of this
                  contract.

         I.       No court order, administrative decision, or action by any
                  other instrumentality of the United States Government or the
                  State of New Jersey or any other state is outstanding which
                  prevents implementation of this contract.

                           Medicaid line of business. The contractor shall
                           provide

                                                                            II-2

ARTICLE THREE: MANAGED CARE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

The contractor's MCMIS shall provide certain minimum functional capabilities as
described in this contract. The contractor shall have sophisticated information
systems capabilities that cannot only support the specific requirements of this
contract, but also respond to future program requirements. The DHS shall provide
the contractor with what the DHS, in its sole discretion, believes is sufficient
lead time to make system changes.

The various components of the contractor's MCMIS shall be sufficiently
integrated to effectively and efficiently support the requirements of this
contract. The contractor's MCMIS shall also be a collection point and repository
for all data required under this contract and shall provide comprehensive
information retrieval capabilities. Contractors with multiple systems and/or
subcontracted health care services shall integrate the data, at a minimum, to
provide for combined reporting and, as required, to support the required
processing functions.

3.1      GENERAL OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MCMIS

         The following requirements apply to the contractor's MCMIS. Any
         reference to "systems" in this Article shall mean contractor's MCMIS
         unless otherwise specified. If the contractor subcontracts any MCMIS
         functions, then these requirements apply to the subcontractor's
         systems. For example, if the contractor contracts with a dental network
         to provide services and pay claims/collect encounters, then these
         requirements shall apply to the dental network's systems. However, if
         the contractor contracts with a dental network only to provide dental
         services, then these requirements do not apply.

3.1.1    ONLINE ACCESS

         The system(s) shall provide online access for contractor use to all
         major files and data elements within the MIS including enrollee
         demographic and enrollment information, provider demographic and
         enrollment data, processed claims and encounters, prior approvals,
         referrals, reference files, and payment and financial transactions.

3.1.2    PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS

         A.       Timely Processing. The contractor shall provide for timely
                  updates and edits for all transactions on a schedule that
                  allows the contractor to meet the State's performance
                  requirements. In general, the State expects the following
                  schedule:

                  1.       Enrollee and provider file updates to be daily

                  2.       Reference file updates to be at least weekly or as
                           needed

                  3.       Prior authorizations and referral updates to be daily

                  4.       Claims and encounters to be processed (entered and
                           edited) daily

                  5.       Claim payments to be at a minimum biweekly

                  6.       Capitation payments to be monthly

                                                                           III-1
<PAGE>
         Specific update schedule requirements are identified in the remaining
         subarticles of this Article.

B.       Error Tracking and Audit Trails. The update and edit processes for each
         transaction shall provide for the monitoring of errors incurred by type
         of error and frequency. The system shall maintain information
         indicating the errors failed, the person making the corrections, when
         the correction was made, and if the error was overridden on all
         critical transactions (e.g., terminating enrollment or denying a
         claim). The major update processes shall maintain sufficient audit
         trails to allow reconstruction of the processing events.

C.       Comprehensive Edits and Audits. The contractor's system shall provide
         for a comprehensive set of automated edits and audits that will ensure
         the data are valid, the benefits are covered and appropriate, the
         payments are accurate and timely, other insurance is maximized, and all
         of the requirements of this contract are met.

D.       System Controls and Balancing. The contractor's system shall provide
         adequate control totals for balancing and ensuring that all inputs are
         accounted for. The contractor shall have operational procedures for
         balancing and validating all outputs and processes. Quality checkpoints
         should be as automated as possible.

E.       Multimedia Input Capability. The system shall support a variety of
         input media formats including hardcopy, diskette, tape, clearing house,
         direct entry, electronic transmission or other means, as defined by all
         federal and State laws and regulations. The contractor may use any
         clearing house(s) and/or alternatively provide for electronic
         submissions directly from the provider to the contractor. These
         requirements apply to claims/encounter and prior authorization (PA),
         referral, and UM subsystems. Provider/vendor data must be routed
         through the contractor when submitting data/information to the State.

F.       Backup/Restore and Archiving. The contractor shall provide for periodic
         backup of all key processing and transaction files such that there will
         be a minimum of interruption in the event of a disaster. Unless
         otherwise agreed by the State, key processes must be restored as
         follows:

         1.       Enrollment verification - twenty-four (24) hours

         2.       Enrollment update process - twenty-four (24) hours

         3.       Prior authorization/referral processing - twenty-four (24)
                  hours

         4.       Claims/encounter processing - seventy-two (72) hours

         5.       Encounter submissions to State - one (1) week

         6.       Other functions - two (2) weeks

         The contractor shall demonstrate its restore capabilities at least once
         a year. The contractor shall also provide for permanent archiving of
         all major files for a

                                                                           III-2
<PAGE>
         period of no less than seven (7) years. The contractor's backup/recover
         plan must be approved by State.

3.1.3    REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

         A.       Regular Reporting. The contractor's system shall provide
                  sufficient reports to meet the requirements of this contract
                  as well as to support the efficient and effective operation of
                  its business functions. The required reports, including time
                  frames and format requirements, are in Section A of the
                  Appendices.

         B.       Ad Hoc Reporting. The contractor shall have the capability to
                  support ad hoc reporting requests, in addition to those listed
                  in this contract, both from its own organization and from the
                  State in a reasonable time frame. The time frame for
                  submission of the report will be determined by DMAHS with
                  input from the contractor based on the nature of the report.
                  DMAHS shall at its option request six (6) to eight (8) reports
                  per year, hardcopy or electronic reports and/or file extracts.
                  This does not preclude or prevent DMAHS from requiring, or the
                  contractor from providing, additional reports that are
                  required by State or federal governmental entities or any
                  court of competent jurisdiction.

         C.       System Documentation. The contractor shall update
                  documentation on its system(s) within 30 days of
                  implementation of the changes. The contractor's documentation
                  must include a system introduction, program overviews,
                  operating environment, external interfaces, and data element
                  dictionary. For each of the functional components, the
                  documentation should include where applicable program
                  narratives, processing flow diagrams, forms, screens, reports,
                  files, detailed logic such as claims pricing algorithms and
                  system edits. The documentation should also include job
                  descriptions and operations instructions. The contractor shall
                  have available current documentation on-site for State audit
                  as requested.

3.1.4    OTHER REQUIREMENTS

         A.       Future Changes. The system shall be easily modifiable to
                  accommodate future system changes/enhancements to claims
                  processing or other related systems at the same time as
                  changes take place in the State's MMIS. In addition, the
                  system shall be able to accommodate all future requirements
                  based upon federal and State statutes, policies and
                  regulations. Unless otherwise agreed by the State, the
                  contractor shall be responsible for the costs of these
                  changes.

         B.       Year 2000. The MCMIS shall meet the Office of Information
                  Technology (OIT) standards for Year 2000 compliance unless
                  otherwise approved by the Department. The OIT standards may be
                  accessed on the Internet at
                  http://www.state.nj.us/infobank/circular/cir9705s.htm.

                                                                           III-3

3.2.1    CONTRACTOR ENROLLMENT DATA

         A.       Enrollee Data. The contractor shall maintain a complete
                  history of enrollee information, including contractor
                  enrollment, primary care provider assignment, third party
                  liability coverage, and Medicare coverage. In addition, the

                           first 10 digits of the Medicaid ID number because the
                           family members may not be residing together.

                  2.       The system shall be able to link family members for
                           on-line inquiry access and for consolidated mailings
                           based on the first ten-digits of the Medicaid ID
                           number.

                  3.       The system shall be able to identify newborns from
                           the date of birth, submit the proper eligibility form
                           to the State, and link the newborn record to the NJ
                           FamilyCare/Medicaid eligibility and enrollment data
                           when these data are received back from the State.

                  4.       The system shall capture and maintain all of the data
                           elements provided by the Department on the weekly
                           update files.

                  descriptions, edit criteria, and effective dates. The system
                  shall support the State's procedure and diagnosis coding
                  schemes and other codes that shall be submitted on the
                  hardcopy and electronic reports and files.

                  The system shall provide for an automated update to the
                  National Drug Code file including all product, packaging,

                  two (2) years active history of adjudicated claims and
                  encounter data for verifying duplicates, checking service
                  limitations, and supporting historical reporting. For drug
                  claims, the contractor may maintain nine (9) months of active
                  history of adjudicated claims/encounter data if it has the
                  ability to restore such information back to two (2) years and
                  provide for permanent archiving in accordance with Article
                  3.1.2F. Provisions should be made to maintain permanent
                  history by service date for those services identified as
                  "once-in-a-lifetime" (e.g., hysterectomy). The system should
                  readily provide access to all types of claims and encounters
                  (hospital, medical, dental, pharmacy, etc.) for combined
                  reporting of claims and encounters. Archive requirements are
                  described in Article 3.1.2F.

3.8.1    GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

         A.       Purpose. The reports should provide information to determine
                  and review fiscal viability, to evaluate the appropriateness
                  of care rendered, and to identify reporting/billing problems

                  The system should provide the capability for pre-defined,
                  parameter driven report/trend alerts. The system shall have
                  the capability to select important and specific parameters of
                  utilization, and have specified users alerted when these

                  transmit data in a secure manner electronically to and from
                  the State's data centers, which are operated by OIT. The
                  standard data transfer software that OIT utilizes for
                  electronic data exchange is Connect: Direct. Both mainframe
                  and PC versions are available. A dedicated line is preferred,
                  but at a minimum connectivity software can be used for the
                  connection.

3.8.2    QUERY CAPABILITIES

         The contractor's MCMIS should have a sophisticated, query tool with
         access to all major files for the users.

         A.       General. The system should provide a user-friendly, online
                  query language to construct database queries to data available
                  across all of the database(s), down to raw data elements. It
                  should provide options to select query output to be displayed
                  on-line, in a formatted hard-copy report, or downloaded to
                  disk for PCbased analysis.

         B.       Unduplicated Counts. The system should provide the capability
                  to execute queries that perform unduplicated counts (e.g.,
                  unduplicated count of original beneficiary ID number),
                  duplicated counts (e.g., total number of services provided for
                  a given aid category), or a combination of unduplicated and
                  duplicated counts.

3.8.3    REPORTING CAPABILITIES

         The contractor should provide reporting tools with its MCMIS that
         facilitate ad hoc, user, and special reporting. The MCMIS should
         provide flexible report formatting/editing capabilities that meet the
         contractor's business requirements and support the Department's
         information needs. For example, it should provide the ability to
         import, export and manipulate data files from spreadsheet, word
         processing and database management tools as well as the database(s) and
         should provide the capability to indicate header information, date and
         run time, and page numbers on reports. The system should provide
         multiple pre-defined report types and formats that are easily selected
         by users.

                                                                          III-17

3.9      ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

         The contractor shall collect, process, format, and submit electronic
         encounter data for all services delivered for which the contractor is
         responsible. The contractor shall capture all required encounter data
         elements using coding structures recognized by the Department. The
         contractor shall process the encounter data, integrating any manual or
         automated systems to validate the adjudicated encounter data. The
         contractor shall interface with any systems or modules within its
         organization to obtain the required encounter data elements. The
         contractor shall submit the encounter data to the Department's fiscal
         agent electronically, via diskette, tape, or electronic transmission,
         according to specifications in the Electronic Media Claims (EMC) Manual
         found in Section B.3.3 of the Appendices. The encounter data processing
         system shall have a data quality assurance plan to include timely data
         capture, accurate and complete encounter records, and internal data
         quality audit procedures. If DMAHS determines that changes are
         required, the contractor shall be given advance notice and time to make
         the change according to the extent and nature of the required change.

3.9.1    REQUIRED ENCOUNTER DATA ELEMENTS

         A.       All Types of Claims. The contractor shall capture all required
                  encounter data elements for each of the eight claim types:
                  Inpatient, Outpatient, Professional, Home Health,
                  Transportation, Vision, Dental, and Pharmacy.

         B.       Data Elements. The required data elements are provided in
                  Section A.7.11 and Section B.3.3 of the Appendices. Note that
                  New Jersey-specific Medicaid codes are required in some
                  fields. Providers shall be identified using the provider's EIN
                  or tax identification number. Inpatient hospital claims and
                  encounters shall be combined into a single stay when the
                  enrollee's dates of services are consecutive.

         C.       Contractor Encounter. The contractor shall submit encounter
                  data for claims and encounters received by the contractor. The
                  contractor shall identify a capitated arrangement versus a
                  "fee-for-service" arrangement for each of its network
                  providers. For noncapitated arrangements, the contractor shall
                  report the actual payment made to the provider for each
                  encounter. For capitated arrangements, the contractor may
                  report a zero payment for each encounter. However, a monthly
                  "Capitation Summary Record" shall be required for each
                  provider type, beneficiary capitation category, and service
                  month combination. The specifications for the submission of
                  monthly capitation summary records is further detailed in the
                  EMC Manual, found in Section B.3.3 of the Appendices.

3.9.2    SUBMISSION OF TEST ENCOUNTER DATA

         A.       Submitter ID. The contractor shall make application in order
                  to obtain a Submitter Identification Number, according to the
                  instructions listed in the EMC Manual found in Section B.3.3
                  of the Appendices.

                                                                          III-18
<PAGE>
         B.       Test Requirement. The contractor shall be required to pass a
                  testing phase for each of the eight encounter claim types
                  before production encounter data will be accepted. The
                  contractor shall pass the testing phase for all encounter
                  claim type submissions within twelve (12) calendar weeks from
                  the award date of the contract. Contractors with prior
                  contracting experience with DHS who have successfully passed
                  test phases and have successfully submitted approved
                  production data may be exempted at DHS's option.

                  The contractor shall submit the test encounter data to the
                  Department's fiscal agent electronically, via diskette, tape,
                  or electronic transmission, according to the specifications of
                  the Electronic Media Claims (EMC) Manual found in Section
                  B.3.3 of the Appendices.

                  The contractor shall be responsible for passing a two-phased
                  test for each encounter claim type. The first phase requires
                  that each submitted file follows the prescribed format, that
                  header and trailer records are present and correctly located
                  within the file, and that the key fields are present. The
                  second phase requires that the required data elements are
                  present and properly valued.

                  Following each submission, an error report will be forwarded
                  to the contractor identifying the file and record location of
                  each error encountered for both testing phases. The contractor
                  shall analyze the report, complete the necessary corrections,
                  and re-submit the encounter data test file(s).

                  The contractor shall utilize production encounter data,
                  systems, tables, and programs when processing encounter test
                  files. The contractor shall submit errorfree production data
                  once testing has been approved for all of the encounter claims
                  types.

3.9.3    SUBMISSION OF PRODUCTION ENCOUNTER DATA

         A.       Adjudicated Claims and Encounters. The contractor shall submit
                  all adjudicated encounter data for all services provided for
                  which the contractor is responsible. Adjudicated encounter
                  data are defined as data from claims and encounters that the
                  contractor has processed as paid or denied. The contractor is
                  not responsible for submitting contested claims or encounters
                  until final adjudication has been determined.

                                                                          III-19
<PAGE>
         B.       Schedule. Encounter data shall be submitted per the schedule
                  established by the Department. Each submission shall include
                  encounter data that were adjudicated in the prior period and
                  any adjustments for encounter data previously submitted.

         C.       Two-Phase Process. Similar to testing, the contractor shall be
                  responsible for passing a two-phased test for all production
                  encounter data submitted. The first phase requires each
                  submitted file follow the prescribed format, that header and
                  trailer records are present and correctly located within the
                  file, and that the key fields are present. The second phase
                  requires that the required data elements are present and
                  properly valued.

         D.       Phase One Errors. If all or part of a production encounter
                  file(s) rejects during phase one, an error report will be
                  forwarded to the contractor identifying the file and record
                  location of each error encountered. The contractor shall
                  analyze the report, complete the necessary corrections, and
                  re-submit the "rejected" encounter production data within
                  forty-five (45) calendar days from the date the contractor
                  receives the notice of error(s).

         E.       The contractor shall not be permitted to provide services
                  under this contract nor shall the contractor receive
                  capitation payment until it has passed the testing and
                  production submission of encounter data.

3.9.4    REMITTANCE ADVICE

         A.       Remittance Advice File Processing Report. The Department's
                  fiscal agent shall produce a Remittance Advice File on a
                  monthly basis that itemizes all processed encounters. The
                  contractor shall be responsible for the acceptance and
                  processing of a Remittance Advice (RA) File according to the
                  specifications listed in the EMC Manual found in Section B.3.3
                  of the Appendices. The Remittance Advice File is produced on
                  magnetic tape and contains all submitted encounter data that
                  passed phase one testing. The disposition (paid or denied)
                  shall be reported for each encounter along with the "phase
                  two" errors for those claims that New Jersey Medicaid denied.

         B.       Reconciliation. The contractor shall be responsible for
                  matching the encounters on the Remittance Advice File against
                  the contractor's data files(s). The contractor shall correct
                  any encounters that denied improperly and/or any other
                  discrepancies noted on the file. Corrections shall be
                  resubmitted within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the
                  contractor receives the Remittance Advice File.

                  All corrections to "denied" encounter data, as reported on the
                  Remittance Advice File, shall be resubmitted as "full record"
                  adjustments, according to the requirements listed in the EMC
                  Manual found in Section B.3.3 of the Appendices.

                                                                          III-20
<PAGE>
3.9.5    SUBCONTRACTS AND ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING FUNCTION

         A.       Interfaces. All encounter data shall be submitted to the
                  Department directly by the contractor. DMAHS shall not accept
                  any encounter data submissions or correspondence directly from
                  any subcontractors, and DMAHS shall not forward any electronic
                  media, reports or correspondence directly to a subcontractor.
                  The contractor shall be required to receive all electronic
                  files and hardcopy material from the Department, or its
                  appointed fiscal agent, and distribute them within its
                  organization or to its subcontractors appropriately.

         B.       Communication. The contractor and its subcontractors shall be
                  represented at all DMAHS meetings scheduled to discuss any
                  issue related to the encounter function requirements.

3.9.6    FUTURE ELECTRONIC ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

         At the present time, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is
         pursuing a standardization of all electronic health care information,
         including encounter data. The contractor shall be responsible for
         completing and paying for any modifications required to submit
         encounter data electronically, according to the same specifications and
         timeframes outlined by HCFA for the New Jersey MMIS.

                                                                          III-21

                  in school.

                                                                            IV-1
<PAGE>
         E.       Existing Plans of Care. The contractor shall honor and pay for
                  plans of care for new enrollees, including prescriptions,
                  durable medical equipment, medical supplies, prosthetic and
                  orthotic appliances, and any other on-going services initiated
                  prior to enrollment with the contractor. Services shall be
                  continued until the enrollee is evaluated by his/her primary
                  care physician and a new plan of care is established with the
                  contractor.

                  The contractor shall use its best efforts to contact the new
                  enrollee or, where applicable, authorized person and/or
                  contractor care manager. However, if after documented,
                  reasonable outreach (i.e., mailers, certified mail, use of
                  MEDM system provided by the State, contact with the Medicaid
                  District Office (MDO), DDD, or DYFS to confirm addresses
                  and/or to request assistance in locating the enrollee) the
                  enrollee fails to respond within 20 working days of certified
                  mail, the contractor may cease paying for the pre-existing
                  service until the enrollee or, where applicable, authorized
                  person, contacts the contractor for re-evaluation.

         G.       Non-Participating Providers. The contractor shall pay for
                  services furnished by non-participating providers to whom an
                  enrollee was referred, even if erroneously referred, by
                  his/her PCP or network specialist. Under no circumstances
                  shall the enrollee bear the cost of such services when
                  referral errors by the contractor or its providers occur. It
                  is the sole responsibility of the contractor to provide
                  regular updates on complete network information to all its
                  providers as well as appropriate policies and procedures for
                  provider referrals.

         H.       The contractor shall have policies and procedures on the use
                  of enrollee selfreferred services.

         I.       The contractor shall have policies and procedures on how it
                  will provide for genetic testing and counseling.

         J.       Second Opinions. The contractor shall have a Second Opinion
                  program that can be utilized at the enrollee's option for
                  diagnosis and treatment of serious medical conditions, such as

         K.       Unless otherwise required by this contract, the contractor
                  shall make no distinctions with regard to the provision of
                  services to Medicaid and NJ FamlyCare enrollees and the
                  provision of services provided to the contractor's
                  non-Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare enrollees.

         L.       DMAHS may intercede on an enrollee's behalf when DMAHS deems
                  it appropriate for the provision of medically necessary
                  services and to assist enrollees with the contractor's
                  operations and procedures which may cause undue hardship for
                  the enrollee. In the event of a difference in interpretation
                  of contractually required service provision between the
                  Department and the contractor, the Department's interpretation
                  shall prevail until a formal decision is reached, if
                  necessary.

                  of care. The enrollee shall be fully informed of the
                  requirement to seek care when it is available within the

                  professionals may not be prohibited from advising their
                  patients about their health status or medical care or
                  treatment, regardless of whether this care is covered as a
                  benefit under the contract.

                  considered either medical or dental such as surgical

4.2      SPECIAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

4.2.1    EMERGENCY SERVICES

         A.       For purposes of this contract, "emergency" means an onset of a
                  medical or behavioral condition, the onset of which is sudden,
                  that manifests itself by symptoms of sufficient severity,
                  including severe pain, that a prudent layperson, who possesses
                  an average knowledge of medicine and health, could reasonably
                  expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result
                  in:

                  1.       Placing the health of the person or others in serious
                           jeopardy;

                  2.       Serious impairment to such person's bodily functions;

                  3.       Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of
                           such person; or

                  4.       Serious disfigurement of such person.

                  With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions,
                  an emergency exists where there is inadequate time to effect a
                  safe transfer to another hospital before delivery or the
                  transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the
                  woman or the unborn child.

         B.       The contractor shall be responsible for emergency services,
                  both within and outside the contractor's enrollment area, as
                  required by an enrollee in the case of an emergency. Emergency
                  services shall also include:

                  1.       Medical examination at an Emergency Room which is
                           required by N.J.A.C. 10:122D-2.5(b) when a foster
                           home placement of a child occurs after business
                           hours.

                                                                           IV-15
<PAGE>
                  2.       Examinations at an Emergency Room for suspected
                           physical/child abuse and/or neglect.

                  3.       Post-Stabilization of Care. The contractor shall
                           comply with 42 C.F.R. 422.100(b)(iv). The contractor
                           must cover post-stabilization services without
                           requiring authorization and regardless of whether the
                           enrollee obtains the services within or outside the
                           contractor's network if:

                           a.       The services were pre-approved by the
                                    contractor or its providers; or

                           b.       The services were not pre-approved by the
                                    contractor because the contractor did not
                                    respond to the provider of
                                    post-stabilization care services' request
                                    for pre-approval within one (1) hour after
                                    being requested to approve such care; or

                           c.       The contractor could not be contacted for
                                    pre-approval.

         C.       Access Standards. The contractor shall ensure that all covered
                  services, that are required on an emergency basis are
                  available to all its enrollees, twenty-four (24) hours per
                  day, seven (7) days per week, either in the contractor's own
                  provider network or through arrangements approved by DMAHS.
                  The contractor shall maintain twenty-four (24) hours per day,
                  seven (7) days per week on-call telephone coverage, including
                  Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD)/Tech Telephone
                  (TT) systems, to advise enrollees of procedures for emergency
                  and urgent care and explain procedures for obtaining
                  non-emergent/ non-urgent care during regular business hours
                  within the enrollment area as well as outside the enrollment
                  area.

         D.       Non-Participating Providers. The contractor shall be
                  responsible for developing and advising its enrollees and
                  where applicable, authorized persons of procedures for
                  obtaining emergency services, including emergency dental
                  services, when it is not medically feasible for enrollees to
                  receive emergency services from or through a participating
                  provider, or when the time required to reach the participating
                  provider would mean risk of permanent damage to the enrollee's
                  health. The contractor shall bear the cost of providing
                  emergency service through non-participating providers.

         E.       Emergency Care Prior Authorization. Prior authorization shall
                  not be required for emergency services. This applies to
                  out-of-network as well as to in-network providers.

         F.       Medical Screenings/Urgent Care. Prior authorization shall not
                  be required for medical screenings or in urgent care
                  situations at the hospital emergency room. The hospital
                  emergency room physician may determine the necessity for

                                                                           IV-16
<PAGE>
                  contacting the PCP or the contractor for information about an
                  enrollee who presents with an urgent condition.

         G.       The contractor shall pay for all medical screening services
                  rendered to its enrollees by hospitals and emergency room
                  physicians. The amount and method of reimbursement for medical
                  screenings shall be subject to negotiation between the
                  contractor and the hospital and directly with non-hospital
                  salaried emergency room physicians and shall include
                  reimbursement for urgent care and non-urgent care rates.
                  Non-participating hospitals may be reimbursed for hospital
                  costs at Medicaid rates or other mutually agreeable rates for
                  medical screening services. Additional fees for additional
                  services may be included at the discretion of the contractor
                  and the hospital.

                  1.       The contractor shall not retroactively deny a claim
                           for an emergency medical screening exam because the
                           condition, which appeared to be an emergency medical
                           condition under the prudent layperson standard, was
                           subsequently determined to be non-emergency in
                           nature.

         H.       The contractor shall be liable for payment for the following
                  emergency services provided to an enrollee:

                  1.       If the screening examination leads to a clinical
                           determination by the examining physician that an
                           actual emergency medical condition exists, the
                           contractor shall pay for both the services involved
                           in the screening exam and the services required to
                           stabilize the patient.

                  2.       All emergency services which are medically necessary
                           until the clinical emergency is stabilized. This
                           includes all treatment that is necessary to assure,
                           within reasonable medical probability, that no
                           material deterioration of the patient's condition is
                           likely to result from, or occur during, discharge of
                           the patient or transfer of the patient to another
                           facility.

                           If there is a disagreement between a hospital and the
                           contractor concerning whether the patient is stable
                           enough for discharge or transfer, or whether the
                           medical benefits of an unstabilized transfer outweigh
                           the risks, the judgment of the attending physician(s)
                           actually caring for the enrollee at the treating
                           facility prevails and is binding on the contractor.
                           The contractor may establish arrangements with
                           hospitals whereby the contractor may send one of its
                           physicians with appropriate ER privileges to assume
                           the attending physician's responsibilities to
                           stabilize, treat, or transfer the patient.

                  3.       If the screening examination leads to a clinical
                           determination by the examining physician that an
                           actual emergency medical condition does not exist,
                           but the enrollee had acute symptoms of sufficient
                           severity at the time of presentation to warrant
                           emergency attention under the prudent

                                                                           IV-17
<PAGE>
                           layperson standard, the contractor shall pay for all
                           services related to the screening examination.

                  4.       The enrollee's PCP or other contractor representative
                           instructs the enrollee to seek emergency care
                           in-network or out-of-network, whether or not the
                           patient meets the prudent layperson definition.

         I.       The contractor may utilize a common list of symptom-based
                  presenting complaints that will reasonably substantiate that

                  include but are not limited to:

                  1.       Severe pain of any kind.

                  2.       Altered mental status, sustained or transient, for

                  3.       Abrupt change in neurological status, sustained or
                           transient, for any reason.

                  4.       Complications of pregnancy.

                  6.       Acute allergic reactions.

                  7.       Shortness of breath.

                  8.       Abdominal pain.

                  9.       Multiple episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, any age.

                  10.      Fever greater than 102.5oF in any age group.

                  13.      Injuries with functional loss of any body part.

                  14.      All patients arriving at the hospital by ambulance

                  17.      Psychiatric disturbances.

         J.       Women who arrive at any emergency room in active labor shall
                  be considered as an emergency situation and the contractor
                  shall reimburse providers of care accordingly.

         K.       If within thirty (30) minutes after receiving a request from a
                  hospital emergency department for a specialty consultation,
                  the contractor fails to identify an appropriate specialist who
                  is available and willing to assume the care of the enrollee,
                  the emergency department may arrange for medically necessary
                  emergency services by an appropriate specialist, and the
                  contractor shall not deny coverage for these services due to
                  lack of prior authorization. The contractor shall not require
                  prior authorization for specialty care emergency services for
                  treatment of any immediately life-threatening medical
                  condition.

         L.       The contractor shall establish and maintain policies and
                  procedures for emergency dental services for all enrollees.

                                                                           IV-18

                  1.       Within the contractor's Enrollment/Service Area, the
                           contractor will ensure that:

                           a.       Enrollees shall have access to emergency
                                    dental services on a twenty-four (24) hour,
                                    seven (7) day a week basis.

                           b.       The contractor shall bear full
                                    responsibility for the provision of
                                    emergency dental services, and shall assure
                                    the availability of a back-up provider in
                                    the event that an on-call provider is
                                    unavailable.

                  2.       Outside the contractor's Service Area, the contractor
                           shall ensure that:

                           a.       Enrollees shall be able to seek emergency
                                    dental services from any licensed dental
                                    provider without the need for prior
                                    authorization from the contractor while
                                    outside the Service Area (including out-of-
                                    state services covered by the Medicaid
                                    program).

         M.       The contractor shall reimburse ambulance and MICU
                  transportation providers responding to "911" calls whether or
                  not the patient's condition is determined, retrospectively, to
                  be an emergency.

4.2.2    FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AND SUPPLIES

         A.       General. Except where specified in Section 4.1, the
                  contractor's enrollees are permitted to obtain family planning
                  services and supplies from either the contractor's family
                  planning provider network or from any other qualified Medicaid
                  family planning provider. The DMAHS shall reimburse family
                  planning services provided by non-participating providers
                  based on the Medicaid fee schedule.

         B.       Non-Participating Providers. The contractor shall cooperate
                  with nonparticipating family planning providers accessed at
                  the enrollee's option by establishing cooperative working
                  relationships with such providers for accepting referrals from
                  them for continued medical care and management of complex
                  health care needs and exchange of enrollee information, where
                  appropriate, to assure provision of needed care within the
                  scope of this contract. The contractor shall not deny coverage
                  of family planning services for a covered diagnostic,
                  preventive or treatment service solely on the basis that the
                  diagnosis was made by a non-participating provider.

                                                                           IV-19

4.2.3    OBSTETRICAL SERVICES REQUIREMENTS/ISSUES

         A.       Obstetrical services shall be provided in the same amount,
                  duration, and scope as the Medicaid HealthStart program.
                  Guidelines, standards, and required program provisions are
                  found in Section B.4.2 of the Appendices.

         B.       The contractor shall not limit benefits for postpartum
                  hospital stays to less than forty-eight (48) hours following a
                  normal vaginal delivery or less than ninety-six (96) hours
                  following a cesarean section, unless the attending provider,
                  in consultation with the mother, makes the decision to
                  discharge the mother or the newborn before that time and the
                  provisions of N.J.S.A. 26:2J-4.9 are met.

                  1.       The contractor shall not provide monetary payments or
                           rebates to mothers to encourage them to accept less
                           than the minimum protections provided for in this
                           Article.

                  2.       The contractor shall not penalize, reduce, or limit
                           the reimbursement of an attending provider because
                           the provider provided care in a manner consistent
                           with this Article.

4.2.4    PRESCRIBED DRUGS AND PHARMACY SERVICES

         A.       General. The contractor shall provide all medically necessary
                  legend and non-legend drugs which are also covered by the
                  Medicaid program and ensure the availability of quality
                  pharmaceutical services for all enrollees including drugs
                  prescribed by Mental Health/Substance Abuse providers. See
                  Article 4.4C for additional information pertaining to MH/SA
                  pharmacy benefits.

         B.       Use of Formulary. The contractor may use a formulary as long
                  as the following minimum requirements are met:

                  1.       The contractor shall only exclude coverage of drugs
                           or drug categories permitted under 1927(d) of the
                           Social Security Act as amended by OBRA 1993. In
                           addition, the contractor shall include in its
                           formulary, if it chooses to operate a formulary, any
                           FDA-approved drugs that may allow for clinical
                           improvement or are clinically advantageous for the
                           management of a disease or condition.

                  2.       The contractor's formulary shall be developed by a
                           Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee that shall
                           represent the needs of all its enrollees including
                           enrollees with special needs. Network physicians and
                           dentists shall have the opportunity to participate in
                           the development of the formulary and, prior to any
                           changes to a drug formulary, to review, consider and
                           comment on proposed changes. The formulary shall be
                           reviewed in its entirety and updated at least
                           annually.

                                                                           IV-20
<PAGE>
                  3.       The formulary for the DMAHS pharmacy benefit and any
                           revision thereto shall be reviewed and approved by
                           DMAHS.

                  4.       The formulary shall include only FDA approved drug
                           products. For each Specific Therapeutic Drug (STD)
                           class, the selection of drugs included for each drug
                           class shall be sufficient to ensure the availability
                           of covered drugs with the least need for prior
                           authorization to be initiated by providers of
                           pharmaceutical services and include FDA approved
                           drugs to best serve the medical needs of enrollees
                           with special needs. In addition, the formulary shall
                           be revised periodically to assure compliance with
                           this requirement.

                  5.       The contractor shall authorize the provision of a
                           drug not on the formulary requested by the PCP or
                           referral provider on behalf of the enrollee if the
                           approved prescriber certifies medical necessity for
                           the drug to the contractor for a determination.
                           Medically accepted indications shall be consistent
                           with Section 1927(k)(6) of the Social Security Act.
                           The contractor shall have in place a DMAHS-approved
                           prior approval process for authorizing the dispensing
                           of such drugs. In addition:

                           a.       Any prior approval issued by the contractor
                                    shall take into consideration prescription
                                    refills related to the original pharmacy
                                    service.

                           b.       A formulary shall not be used to deny
                                    coverage of any Medicaid covered outpatient
                                    drug determined medically necessary through
                                    the review and appeal process. The prior
                                    approval process shall be used to ensure
                                    drug coverage consistent with the policies
                                    of the New Jersey Medicaid program.

                           c.       Prior approval may be used for covered drug
                                    products under the following conditions:

                                    i.       For prescribing and dispensing
                                             medically necessary non-formulary
                                             drugs.

                                    ii.      To limit drug coverage consistent
                                             with the policies of the Medicaid
                                             program.

                                    iii.     To minimize potential drug
                                             over-utilization.

                                    iv.      To accommodate exceptions to
                                             Medicaid drug utilization review
                                             standards related to proper
                                             maintenance drug therapy.

                           d.       Except for the use of approved generic drug
                                    substitution of brand drugs, under no
                                    circumstances shall the contractor permit
                                    the therapeutic substitution of a prescribed
                                    drug without a prescriber's authorization.

                                                                           IV-21
<PAGE>
                           e.       The contractor shall not penalize the
                                    prescriber or enrollee, financially or
                                    otherwise, for such requests and approvals.

                           f.       Determinations shall be made within
                                    twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of all
                                    necessary information. A seventy-two
                                    (72)-hour supply of medication shall be
                                    permitted without prior authorization in
                                    emergency situations or if a determination
                                    has not been made within the required
                                    timeframe.

                           g.       Denials of off-formulary requests or
                                    offering of an alternative medication shall
                                    be provided to the prescriber and/or
                                    enrollee in writing. All denials shall be
                                    reported to the DMAHS quarterly.

                  6.       The contractor shall publish and distribute hard copy
                           or on-line, at least annually, its current formulary
                           (if the contractor uses a formulary) to all
                           prescribing providers and pharmacists. Updates to the
                           formulary shall be distributed in all formats within
                           sixty (60) days of the changes.

                  7.       If the formulary includes generic equivalents, the
                           contractor shall provide for a brand name exception
                           process for prescribers to use when medically
                           necessary.

                  8.       The contractor shall establish and maintain a

                           one year of age is recommended. A referral to a
                           dentist is mandatory at three years of age and
                           annually thereafter through age twenty (20) years.

                  4.       Hearing Services. At a minimum, include diagnosis and
                           treatment for defects in hearing, including hearing
                           aids. For infants identified as at risk for hearing
                           loss through the New Jersey Newborn Hearing Screening
                           Program, hearing screening should be conducted prior
                           to three months of age using professionally
                           recognized audiological assessment techniques. For
                           all other children, hearing screening means, at a
                           minimum, observation of an infant's response to
                           auditory stimuli and audiogram for a child three (3)
                           years of age and older. Speech and hearing assessment
                           shall be a part of each preventive visit for an older
                           child.

                  5.       Mental Health/Substance Abuse. Include a mental
                           health/substance abuse assessment documenting
                           pertinent findings. When there is an indication of
                           possible MH/SA issues, a mental health/substance
                           abuse screening tool(s) found in Section B.4.9 of the
                           Appendices or a DHS - approved equivalent shall be
                           used to evaluate the enrollee.

                  6.       Such other necessary health care, diagnostic
                           services, treatment, and other measures to correct or
                           ameliorate defects, and physical and mental/substance
                           abuse illnesses and conditions discovered by the
                           screening services.

                                                                           IV-26

                  7.       Lead Screening. The contractor shall provide a
                           screening program for the presence of lead toxicity
                           in children which shall consist of two components:
                           verbal risk assessment and blood lead testing.

                           a.       Verbal Risk Assessment - The provider shall
                                    perform a verbal risk assessment for lead
                                    toxicity at every periodic visit between the
                                    ages of six (6) and seventy-two (72) months
                                    as indicated on the schedule. The verbal
                                    risk assessment includes, at a minimum, the
                                    following types of questions:

                                    i.       Does your child live in or
                                             regularly visit a house built
                                             before 1960? Does the house have
                                             chipping or peeling paint?

                                    ii.      Was your child's day care
                                             center/preschool/babysitter's home
                                             built before 1960? Does the house
                                             have chipping or peeling paint?

                                    iii.     Does your child live in or
                                             regularly visit a house built
                                             before 1960 with recent, ongoing,
                                             or planned renovation or
                                             remodeling?

                                    iv.      Have any of your children or their
                                             playmates had lead poisoning?

                                    v.       Does your child frequently come in
                                             contact with an adult who works
                                             with lead? Examples include
                                             construction, welding, pottery, or
                                             other trades practiced in your
                                             community.

                                    vi.      Do you give your child home or folk
                                             remedies that may contain lead?

                                    Generally, a child's level of risk for
                                    exposure to lead depends upon the answers to
                                    the above questions. If the answer to all
                                    questions are negative, a child is
                                    considered at low risk for high doses of
                                    lead exposure. If the answers to any
                                    question is affirmative or "I don't know," a
                                    child is considered at high risk for high
                                    doses of lead exposure. Regardless of risk,
                                    each child must be tested between nine (9)
                                    months and eighteen (18) months, preferably
                                    at twelve (12) months of age, at 18-26
                                    months, preferably at two (2) years, and any
                                    child between twenty-seven (27) and
                                    seventy-two (72) months of age not
                                    previously tested. A child's risk category
                                    can change with each administration of the
                                    verbal risk assessment.

                                                                           IV-27

                           b.       Blood Lead Testing - All screening must be
                                    done through a blood lead level
                                    determination. The contractor must implement
                                    a screening program to identify and treat
                                    high-risk children for leadexposure and
                                    toxicity. The screening program shall
                                    include blood level screening, diagnostic
                                    evaluation and treatment with follow-up care
                                    of children whose blood lead levels are
                                    elevated. The EP test is no longer
                                    acceptable as a screening test for lead
                                    poisoning; however, it is still valid as a
                                    screening test for iron deficiency anemia.
                                    Screening blood lead testing may be
                                    performed by either a capillary sample
                                    (fingerstick) or a venous sample. However,
                                    all elevated blood levels (equal to or
                                    greater than ten (10) micrograms per one (1)
                                    deciliter) obtained through a capillary
                                    sample must be confirmed by a venous sample.
                                    The blood lead test must be performed by a
                                    New Jersey Department of Health and Senior
                                    Services licensed laboratory. The frequency
                                    with which the blood test is to be
                                    administered depends upon the results of the
                                    verbal risk assessment. For children
                                    determined to be at low risk for high doses
                                    of lead exposure, a screening blood lead
                                    test must be performed once between the ages
                                    of nine (9) and eighteen (18) months,
                                    preferably at twelve (12) months, once
                                    between 18-26 months, preferably at
                                    twenty-four (24) months, and for any child
                                    between twenty-seven (27) and seventy-two
                                    (72) months not previously tested. For
                                    children determined to be at high risk for
                                    high doses of lead exposure, a screening
                                    blood test must be performed at the time a
                                    child is determined to be a high risk
                                    beginning at six months of age if there is
                                    pertinent information or evidence that the
                                    child may be at risk at younger ages than
                                    stated in 4.2.6B.1.d.

                                    i.       If the initial blood lead test
                                             results are less than ten (10)
                                             micrograms per deciliter, a verbal
                                             risk assessment is required at
                                             every subsequent periodic visit
                                             through seventytwo (72) months of
                                             age, with mandatory blood lead
                                             testing performed according to the
                                             schedule in 4.2.6B.7.

                                    ii.      If the child is found to have a
                                             blood lead level equal to or
                                             greater than ten (10) micrograms
                                             per deciliter, providers should use
                                             their professional judgment, in
                                             accordance with the CDC guidelines
                                             regarding patient management and
                                             treatment, as well as follow-up
                                             blood test.

                                    iii.     If a child between the ages of
                                             twenty-four (24) months and
                                             seventy-two (72) months has not
                                             received a screening blood lead
                                             test, the child must receive the
                                             blood lead test immediately,
                                             regardless of whether the child is
                                             determined

                                                                           IV-28

                                             to be a low or high risk according
                                             to the answers to the above-listed
                                             questions.

                                    iv.      When a child is found to have a
                                             blood lead level equal to or
                                             greater than twenty (20) ug/dl, the
                                             contractor shall ensure its PCPs
                                             cooperate with the local health
                                             department in whose jurisdiction
                                             the child resides to facilitate the
                                             environmental investigation to
                                             determine and remediate the source
                                             of lead. This cooperation shall
                                             include sharing of information
                                             regarding the child's care,
                                             including the scheduling and
                                             results of follow-up blood lead

4.2.7    IMMUNIZATIONS

         A.       General. The contractor shall ensure that its providers
                  furnish immunizations to its enrollees in accordance with the
                  most current recommendations for vaccines and periodicity
                  schedule of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
                  (ACIP) (See Section B.4.3 of the Appendices) and any
                  subsequent revision to the schedule as formally recommended by
                  the ACIP, whether or not included as a contract amendment. To
                  the extent possible, the State will provide copies of updated
                  schedules and vaccine recommendations.

         B.       New Vaccines. New vaccines and/or new scheduling or method of
                  administration shall be provided as recommended by the ACIP.
                  The contractor shall monitor periodic recommendations and
                  disseminate updated instruction to its providers and assure
                  appropriate payment adjustment to its providers.

         C.       The contractor shall build in provisions for appropriate
                  reimbursement for catch-up immunizations its providers shall
                  provide for those pediatric enrollees who have missed
                  age-appropriate vaccines.

         D.       Vaccines for Children Program

                  1.       Contractor's providers must enroll with the
                           Department of Health and Senior Services' Vaccines
                           for Children (VFC) Program and use the free vaccine
                           for its enrollees if the vaccine is covered by VFC.
                           (See Section B.4.4 of the Appendices for list of
                           vaccines to be covered by the NJ DHSS VFC program.)
                           The contractor shall not receive from DHS any
                           reimbursement for the cost of VFC-covered vaccines.

                  2.       For non-VFC vaccines the contractor shall reimburse
                           its providers for the cost of both administration and
                           the vaccines.

         E.       To the extent possible, and as permitted by New Jersey
                  statutes and regulations, the contractor and its network
                  providers shall participate in the Statewide immunization
                  registry database, when it becomes fully operational.

         F.       The contractor shall provide immunizations recommended by
                  local health departments based on local epidemiological
                  conditions.

4.2.8    CLINICAL TRIALS

         A.       The contractor shall permit participation in an approved
                  clinical trial to a qualified enrollee (as defined in 4.2.8B),
                  and the contractor:

                  1.       May not deny the enrollee participation in the
                           clinical trial referred to in 4.2.8B.2.

                                                                           IV-32
<PAGE>
                  2.       Subject to 4.2.8C, may not deny (or limit or impose
                           additional conditions on) the coverage of routine
                           patient costs for items and services furnished in
                           connection with participation in the trial.

                  3.       May not discriminate against the enrollee on the
                           basis of the enrollee's participation in such trial.

         B.       Qualified Enrollee Defined. For purposes of this Article, the
                  term "qualified enrollee" means an enrollee under the
                  contractor's coverage who meets the following conditions:

                  1.       The enrollee has a life-threatening or serious
                           illness for which no standard treatment is effective;

                  2.       The enrollee is eligible to participate in an
                           approved clinical trial with respect to treatment of
                           such illness;

                  3.       The enrollee and the referring physician conclude
                           that the enrollee's participation in such trial would
                           be appropriate; and

                  4.       The enrollee's participation in the trial offers
                           potential for significant clinical benefit for the
                           enrollee.

         C.       Payment. The contractor shall provide for payment for medical
                  problems/complications and for routine patient costs described
                  in Article 4.2.8A2 but is not required to pay for costs of
                  items and services that are reasonably expected to be paid for
                  by the sponsors of an approved clinical trial.

         D.       Approved Clinical Trial. For purposes of this Article, the
                  term "approved clinical trial" means a clinical research study
                  or clinical investigation that meets the following
                  requirements:

                  1.       The trial is approved and funded by one or more of
                           the following:

                           a.       The National Institutes of Health

                           b.       A cooperative group or center of the
                                    National Institutes of Health

                           c.       The Department of Veterans Affairs

                           d.       The Department of Defense

                           e.       The Food and Drug Administration, in the
                                    form of an investigational new drug (IND)
                                    exemption

                  2.       The facility and personnel providing the treatment
                           are capable of doing so by virtue of their experience
                           or training.

                  3.       There is no alternative noninvestigational therapy
                           that is clearly superior.

                                                                           IV-33
<PAGE>
                  4.       The available clinical or preclinical data provide a
                           reasonable expectation that the protocol treatment
                           will be at least as effective as the
                           noninvestigational alternative.

         E.       Coverage of Investigational Treatment. The contractor should
                  make a determination for coverage/denial of experimental
                  treatment for a terminal condition based on the following:

                  1.       The treating physician refers the case to a
                           contractor internal review group not associated with
                           the case or referral center.

                  2.       If the internal review group denies the referral, a
                           second, ad hoc group with two or more experts in the
                           field and not involved with the case must review the
                           case.

         F.       Experimental treatments for rare disorders shall not be
                  automatically excluded from coverage but decisions regarding
                  their medical necessity should be considered by a medical
                  review board established by the contractor. Routine costs
                  associated with investigational procedures that are part of an
                  approved research trial are considered medically appropriate.
                  Under no circumstances shall the contractor implement a
                  medical necessity standard that arbitrarily limits coverage on
                  the basis of the illness or condition itself.

4.2.9    HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS

         The contractor shall identify relevant community issues (such as TB
         outbreaks, violence) and health education needs of its enrollees, and
         implement plans that are culturally appropriate to meet those needs,
         issues relevant to each of the target population groups of enrollees
         served, as defined in Article 5.2, and the promotion of health. The
         contractor shall use community-based needs assessments and other
         relevant information available from State and local governmental
         agencies and community groups. Health promotion activities shall be
         made available in formats and presented in ways that meet the needs of
         all enrollee groups including elderly enrollees and enrollees with
         special needs, including enrollees with cognitive impairments. The
         contractor shall comply with all applicable State and federal statutes
         and regulations on health wellness programs. The contractor shall
         submit a written description of all planned health education activities
         and targeted implementation dates for DMAHS' approval, prior to
         implementation, including culturally and linguistically appropriate
         materials and materials developed to accommodate each of the enrolled
         target population groups. Thereafter, the plan shall be reviewed,
         revised, and pre-approved by the Department annually.

         Health promotion topics shall include, but are not limited to, the
         following:

         A.       General health education classes

                                                                           IV-34

         F.       Early intervention and risk reduction strategies to avoid
                  complications of disability and chronic illness

         G.       Prevention and treatment of alcohol and substance abuse

         H.       Coping with losses resulting from disability or aging

         I.       Self care training, including self-examination

         J.       Need for clear understanding of how to take over-the-counter
                  and prescribed medications and the importance of coordinating
                  all such medications

         K.       Understanding the difference between emergent, urgent and
                  routine health conditions

                           supporting enforcement of contractor's health care
                           delivery system policies and procedures for accessing
                           all health care needs.

                  7.       Policies and procedures addressing the need through

                           prior authorization to utilize the contractor's
                           established provider network and what will be done
                           for out-of-network referrals in cases where the
                           contractor does not have an appropriate participating
                           provider in accordance with Article 4.8.7.

                  8.       Policies and procedures for providing comprehensive
                           medical examinations in accordance with EPSDT

         C.       The contractor shall evaluate referred SBYSP patients to
                  determine the need for treatment/therapies for problems
                  identified by staff of those programs. The contractor/PCP
                  shall be responsible for providing treatment and follow-up

                                                                           IV-37
<PAGE>

                  participants where there is no formal
                  contractual/reimbursement relationship.

         D.       The contractor shall review referrals and provide appointments
                  in accordance with Article 5.12. Denials of service requests
                  or reduction in level of service, only after an evaluation is
                  completed, shall be in writing, following the requirements in
                  Article 4.6.4.

         E.       The contractor shall provide the DMAHS with a description of
                  its plans to meet the requirements of this contract provision
                  in establishing a working linkage with SBYSPs.

4.3.4    LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

         The contractor shall demonstrate to DMAHS that it has established a
         working linkage with local health departments (LHDs) that meet
         credentialing and scope of service requirements.

         The contractor should include linkages with LHDs especially for meeting
         the lead screening and toxicity treatment compliance standards required
         in this contract. The contractor shall refer lead-burdened children to
         LHDs for environmental investigation to determine and remediate the
         source of lead.

4.3.5    WIC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS/ISSUES

         The contractor shall require its providers to refer potentially
         eligible women (pregnant, breast-feeding and postpartum), infants, and
         children up to age five, to established community Women, Infants and
         Children (WIC) programs. The referral shall include the information
         needed by WIC programs in order to provide appropriate services. The
         required information to be included with the referral is found on the
         sample forms in Section B.4.8 of the Appendices, the New Jersey WIC
         program medical referral form, and must be completed with the current
         (within sixty (60) days) height, weight, hemoglobin, or hematocrit, and
         any identified medical/nutritional problems for the initial WIC
         referral and for all subsequent certifications. The contractor shall

4.4      COORDINATION WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES

         The State shall retain a separate Mental Health/Substance Abuse system
         for the coordination and monitoring of most mental health/substance
         abuse conditions. The contractor shall furnish MH/SA services to
         clients of DDD. However, as described below, the contractor shall
         retain responsibility for MH/SA screening, referrals, prescription
         drugs, higher-mode transportation, and for treatment of the conditions
         identified in Article 4.1.2B.

         A.       Screening Procedures. Mental health and substance abuse
                  problems shall be systematically identified and addressed by
                  the enrollee's PCP at the earliest possible time following
                  initial participation of the enrollee in the contractor or
                  after the onset of a condition requiring mental health and/or
                  substance abuse treatment. PCPs and other providers shall
                  utilize mental health/substance abuse screening tools as set
                  forth in Section B.4.9 of the Appendices as well as other
                  mechanisms to facilitate early identification of mental health
                  and substance abuse needs for treatment. The contractor may
                  request permission to use alternative screening tools. The use
                  of alternative screening tools shall be pre-approved by DMAHS.
                  The lack of motivation of an enrollee to participate in
                  treatment shall not be considered a factor in determining
                  medical necessity and shall not be used as a rationale for
                  withholding or limiting treatment of an enrollee.

                  The contractor shall present its policies and procedures
                  regarding how its providers will identify enrollees with MH/SA
                  service needs, how they will encourage these enrollees to
                  begin treatment, and the screening tools to be used to
                  identify enrollees requiring MH/SA services. The contractor
                  should refer to the DSM-IV Primary Care Version in development
                  of its procedures.

         B.       Referrals. The contractor shall be responsible for referring
                  or coordinating referrals of enrollees as indicated to Mental
                  Health/Substance Abuse providers. In order to facilitate this,
                  the contractor may contact DMHS or its agent (e.g., if the
                  State contracts with a third party administrator (TPA) for a
                  list of MH/SA providers. Enrollees may be referred to a MH/SA
                  provider by the PCP, family members, other providers, State
                  agencies, the contractor's staff, or may self-refer.

                  1.       The contractor shall be responsible for referrals
                           from MH/SA providers for medical diagnostic work-up
                           to formulate a diagnosis or to effect the treatment
                           of a MH/SA disorder and ongoing medical care for any
                           enrollee

                                                                           IV-39
<PAGE>
                           with a MH/SA diagnosis and shall coordinate the care
                           with the MH/SA provider. This includes the
                           responsibility for physical examinations (with the
                           exception of physical examinations performed in
                           direct connection with the administration of
                           Methadone, which will remain FFS), neurological
                           evaluations, laboratory testing and radiologic
                           examinations, and any other diagnostic procedures
                           that are necessary to make the diagnostic
                           determination between a primary MH/SA disorder and an
                           underlying physical disorder, as well as for medical
                           work-ups required for medical clearances prior to the
                           provision of psychiatric medication or
                           electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or for transfer to a
                           psychiatric/SA facility. Routine laboratory
                           procedures ordered by treating MH/SA providers in
                           conjunction with MH/SA treatment, for routine blood
                           testing performed in conjunction with the
                           administration of Clozapine and the other drugs
                           listed in Article 4.1.4B for non-DDD enrollees, are
                           not the responsibility of the contractor.

                  2.       The contractor shall develop a referral process to be
                           used by its providers which shall include providing a
                           copy of the medical consultation and diagnostic
                           results to the MH/SA provider. The contractor shall
                           develop procedures to allow for notification of an
                           enrollee's MH/SA provider of the findings of his/her
                           physical examination and laboratory/radiological
                           tests within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt for
                           urgent cases and within five business days in
                           non-urgent cases. This notification shall be made by
                           phone with follow-up in writing when feasible.

         C.       Pharmacy Services. Except for the drugs specified in Article
                  4.1.4 (Clozapine, Risperidone, Olanzapine, etc.), all pharmacy
                  services are covered by the contractor. This includes drugs
                  prescribed by the contractor or MH/SA providers. The
                  contractor shall only restrict or require a prior
                  authorization for prescriptions or pharmacy services
                  prescribed by MH/SA providers if one of the following
                  exceptions is demonstrated:

                  1.       The drug prescribed is not related to the treatment
                           of substance abuse/dependency/addiction or mental
                           illness or to any side effects of the
                           psychopharmacological agents. These drugs are to be
                           prescribed by the contractor's PCP or specialists in
                           the contractor's network.

                  2.       The prescribed drug does not conform to standard
                           rules of the contractor's pharmacy plan.

                  3.       The contractor, at its option, may require a prior
                           authorization (PA) process if the number of
                           prescriptions written by the MH/SA provider for
                           MH/SA-related conditions exceed four (4) per month
                           per enrollee. For drugs that require weekly
                           prescriptions, these prescriptions shall be counted
                           as one per month and not as four separate
                           prescriptions. The

                                                                           IV-40
<PAGE>
                           contractor's PA process for the purposes of this
                           section shall require review and prior approval by
                           DMAHS.

         D.       Prescription Abuse. If the contractor suspects prescription
                  abuse by a MH/SA provider, the contractor shall contact DMAHS
                  for investigation and decision of potentially excluding the
                  provider from the NJ Medicaid program. The contractor shall
                  provide the Department with any and all documentation.

         E.       Inpatient Hospital Services for Enrollees who are not clients
                  of DDD with both a Physical Health as well as a Mental
                  Health/Substance Abuse Diagnosis. The contractor's financial
                  and medical management responsibilities are as follows:

                  1.       If the inpatient hospital admission of an enrollee
                           who is not a client of DDD is for a physical health
                           primary diagnosis, the contractor shall be
                           responsible for inpatient hospital costs and medical
                           management. Where psychiatric consultation is
                           required to assist the contractor with mental
                           health/substance abuse management, the State or its
                           agent (e.g., a TPA) shall be responsible for
                           authorizing the psychiatric consult/services provided
                           during the inpatient stay. The State shall not
                           require service authorization for at least one
                           psychiatric consultation per inpatient admission.
                           When a substance abuse disorder is known to be the
                           primary diagnosis of an enrollee and a co-occurring
                           psychiatric disorder is not a management concern,
                           then the State or its agent may authorize that the
                           consult/services be by an ASAM certified physician.
                           The contractor shall coordinate inpatient MH/SA
                           consultations and services with the enrollee's MH/SA
                           provider as well as discharge planning and follow-up.

                  2.       If the inpatient hospital admission of an enrollee
                           who is not a client of DDD is for a mental
                           health/substance abuse primary diagnosis, the
                           inpatient stay will be paid by the State through the
                           FFS program. The contractor shall provide and pay for
                           participating providers who may be called in as
                           consultants to manage any physical problems.

         F.       Transportation. The contractor shall be responsible for all
                  transportation through ambulance, Mobile Intensive Care Units
                  (MICUs), and invalid coach modalities, even if the enrollee is
                  being transported to a Medicaid or NJ FamilyCare service that
                  is not included in the contractor's benefit package including
                  to MH/SA services.

4.5      ENROLLEES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS

4.5.1    INTRODUCTION

         For purposes of this contract, adults with special needs includes
         complex/chronic medical conditions requiring specialized health care
         services, including persons with physical, mental, substance abuse,
         and/or developmental disabilities, including such

                                                                           IV-41

         persons who are homeless. Children with special health care needs are
         those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical,
         developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require
         health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by
         children generally.

         In addition to the standards set forth in this Article, contractor
         shall make all reasonable efforts and accommodations to ensure that
         services provided to enrollees with special needs are equal in quality
         and accessibility to those provided to all other enrollees.

4.5.2    GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

         A.       Identification and Service Delivery. The contractor shall have
                  in place all of the following to identify and serve enrollees
                  with special needs:

                  1.       Methods for identifying persons at risk of, or having
                           special needs who should be referred for a
                           comprehensive needs assessment. (See Articles 4.5.4B
                           and 4.6.5D for information on Complex Needs
                           Assessments). Such methods should include the
                           application of screening procedures/instruments for
                           new enrollees as well as the conditions and
                           indicators listed in Article 4.6.5D.1 and 2. These
                           include review of hospital and pharmacy utilization
                           and policies and procedures for providers or, where
                           applicable, authorized persons, to make referrals of
                           assessment candidates and for enrollees to self-refer
                           for a Complex Needs Assessment.

                  2.       Methods and guidelines for determining the specific
                           needs of referred individuals who have been
                           identified through a Complex Needs Assessment as
                           having complex needs and developing care plans that
                           address their service requirements with respect to
                           specialist physician care, durable medical equipment,
                           medical supplies, home health services, social
                           services, transportation, etc. Article 4.5.4D
                           contains additional information on Individual Health
                           Care Plans.

                  3.       Care management systems to ensure all required
                           services, as identified through a Complex Needs
                           Assessment, are furnished on a timely basis, and that
                           communication occurs between participating and
                           nonparticipating providers (to the extent the latter
                           are used). Articles 4.5.4 and 4.6.5 contain
                           additional information on care management.

                  4.       Policies and procedures to allow for the continuation
                           of existing relationships with non-participating
                           providers, when appropriate providers are not
                           available within network or it is otherwise
                           considered by the contractor to be in the best
                           medical interest of the enrollee with special needs.
                           Articles 4.5.2D and 4.8.7G contain more specific
                           standards for use of non-participating providers.

                                                                           IV-42
<PAGE>
                  5.       Methods to assure that access to all
                           contractor-covered services, including
                           transportation, is available for enrollees with
                           special needs whose disabilities substantially impede
                           activities of daily living. The contractor shall
                           reasonably accommodate enrollees with disabilities
                           and shall ensure that physical and communication
                           barriers do not prohibit enrollees with disabilities
                           from obtaining services from the contractor.

                  6.       Services for enrollees with special needs must be
                           provided in a manner responsive to the nature of a
                           person's disability/specific health care need and
                           include adequate time for the provision of the
                           service.

         B.       The contractor shall ensure that any new enrollee identified
                  (either by the information on the Plan Selection form at the
                  time of enrollment or by contractor providers after
                  enrollment) as having complex/chronic conditions receives
                  immediate transition planning. The planning shall be completed
                  within a timeframe appropriate to the enrollee's condition,
                  but in no case later than ten (10) business days from the
                  effective date of enrollment when the Plan Selection form has
                  an indication of special health care needs or within thirty
                  (30) days after special conditions are identified by a
                  provider. This transition planning shall not constitute the
                  IHCP described in Sections 4.5.4 and 4.6.5. Transition
                  planning shall provide for a brief, interim plan to ensure
                  uninterrupted services until a more detailed plan of care is
                  developed. The transition planning process includes, but is
                  not limited to:

                  1.       Review of existing care plans.

                  2.       Preparation of a transition plan that ensures
                           continuous care during the transfer into the
                           contractor's network.

                  3.       If durable medical equipment had been ordered prior
                           to enrollment but not received by the time of
                           enrollment, the contractor must coordinate and
                           follow-through to ensure that the enrollee receives
                           necessary equipment.

         C.       Outreach and Enrollment Staff. The contractor shall have
                  outreach and enrollment staff who are trained to work with
                  enrollees with special needs, are knowledgeable about their
                  care needs and concerns, and are able to converse in the
                  different languages common among the enrolled population,
                  including TDD/TT and American Sign Language if necessary.

         D.       Specialty Care. The contractor shall have a procedure by which
                  a new enrollee upon enrollment, or an enrollee upon diagnosis,
                  who requires very complex, highly specialized health care
                  services over a prolonged period of time, or with (i) a
                  life-threatening condition or disease or (ii) a degenerative
                  and/or disabling condition or disease, either of which
                  requires specialized medical care over a prolonged period of
                  time, may receive a referral to a specialist or a specialty
                  care center with expertise in treating the life-threatening
                  disease or specialized

                                                                           IV-43
<PAGE>
                  condition, who shall be responsible for and capable of
                  providing and coordinating the enrollee's primary and
                  specialty care.

                  If the contractor or primary care provider in consultation
                  with the contractor's medical director and a specialist, if
                  any, determines that the enrollee's care would most
                  appropriately be coordinated by such specialist/specialty care
                  center, the contractor shall refer the enrollee. Such referral
                  shall be pursuant to a care plan approved by the contractor,
                  in consultation with the primary care provider if appropriate,
                  the specialist, care manager, and the enrollee (or, where
                  applicable, authorized person). The contractor-participating
                  specialist/specialty care center acting as both primary and
                  specialty care provider shall be permitted to treat the
                  enrollee without a referral from the enrollee's primary care
                  provider and may authorize such referrals, procedures, tests
                  and other medical services as the enrollee's primary care
                  provider would otherwise be permitted to provide or authorize,
                  subject to the terms of the care plan. If the
                  specialist/specialty care center will not be providing primary
                  care, then the contractor's rules for referrals apply.
                  Consideration for policies and procedures should be given for
                  a standing referral when on-going, long-term specialty care is
                  required.

                  If the contractor refers an enrollee to a non contractor-
                  participating provider, services provided pursuant to the
                  approved care plan shall be provided at no additional cost to
                  the enrollee. In no event shall the contractor be required to
                  permit an enrollee to elect to have a non contractor-
                  participating specialist/specialty care center.

                  For purposes of this Article a specialty care center shall
                  mean the Centers of Excellence identified in Section B.4.10 of
                  the Appendices. These centers have special expertise in
                  treating life-threatening diseases/conditions and degenerative
                  /disabling diseases/conditions.

         E.       Dental. While the contractor must assure that enrollees with
                  special needs have access to all medically necessary care, the
                  State considers dental services to be an area meriting
                  particular attention. The contractor, therefore, shall accept
                  for network participation dental providers with expertise in
                  the dental management of enrollees with developmental
                  disabilities. All current providers of dental services to
                  enrollees with developmental disabilities shall be considered
                  for participation in the contractor's dental provider network.
                  Credentialing and recredentialing standards must be
                  maintained. The contractor shall make provisions for providers
                  of dental services to enrollees with developmental
                  disabilities to allow for limiting their dental practices at
                  their choice to only those patients with developmental
                  disabilities.

                  The contractor shall develop specific policies and procedures
                  for the provision of dental services to enrollees with
                  developmental disabilities. At a minimum, the policies and
                  procedures shall address:

                                                                           IV-44
<PAGE>
                  1.       Special needs/issues of enrollees with developmental
                           disabilities, including the importance of providing
                           consultations and assistance to patient caregivers.

                  2.       Provisions in the contractor's dental reimbursement
                           system for initial and follow-up dental visits which
                           may require up to 60 minutes on average to allow for
                           a comprehensive dental examination and other services
                           to include, but not limited to: a visual examination
                           of the enrollee; appropriate radiographs; dental
                           prophylaxis, including extra scaling and topical
                           applications, such as fluoride treatments;
                           non-surgical periodontal treatment, including root
                           planing and scaling; the application of dental
                           sealants on molars and premolars; thorough inquiries
                           regarding patient medical histories; and most
                           importantly, consultations with patient caregivers to
                           establish a thorough understanding of proper dental
                           management during visits.

                  3.       Standards for dental visits that recognize the
                           additional time that may be required in treatment of
                           patients with developmental disabilities. Standards
                           should allow for up to four (4) visits annually
                           without prior authorization.

                  4.       Provisions for home visits when medically necessary
                           and where available.

                  5.       Policies and procedures to ensure that providers
                           specializing in the treatment of enrollees with
                           developmental disabilities have adequate support
                           staff to meet the needs of such patients.

                  6.       Provisions for use and replacement of fixed as well
                           as removable prosthetic devices as medically
                           necessary and appropriate.

                  7.       Provisions in the contractor's dental reimbursement
                           system to reimburse dentists for the costs of
                           preoperative and postoperative evaluations associated
                           with dental surgery performed on patients with
                           developmental disabilities. Preauthorization shall
                           not be required for dental procedures performed
                           during surgery on these patients for dentally
                           appropriate restorative care provided under general
                           anesthesia. Informed consent, signed by the enrollee
                           or authorized person, must be obtained prior to the
                           surgical procedure. Provisions should be made to
                           evaluate such procedures as part of a post payment
                           review process.

                  8.       Provisions in the contractor's dental reimbursement
                           system for dentists to receive reimbursement for the
                           cost of providing oral hygiene instructions to
                           caregivers to maintain a patient's overall oral
                           health between dental visits. Such provisions shall
                           include designing and implementing a "dental
                           management" plan, coordinated by the care manager,
                           for overseeing a patient's oral health.

                                                                           IV-45
<PAGE>
                  9.       The care manager of an enrollee with a developmental
                           disability shall coordinate authorizations for
                           dentally required hospitalizations by consulting with
                           the plan's dental and medical consultants in an
                           efficient and time-sensitive manner.

         F.       After Hours. The contractor shall have policies and procedures
                  to respond to crisis situations after hours for enrollees with
                  special needs. Training sessions/materials and triage
                  protocols for all staff/providers who respond to after-hours
                  calls shall address enrollees with special needs. For example,
                  protocols should recognize that a non-urgent condition for an
                  otherwise healthy individual, such as a moderately elevated
                  temperature, may indicate an urgent care need in the case of a
                  child with a congenital heart anomaly.

         G.       Behavior Problems. The contractor shall take appropriate steps
                  to ensure that its care managers, network providers and Member
                  Services staff are able to serve persons with behavior
                  problems associated with developmental disabilities, including
                  to the extent these problems affect their level of compliance.
                  The contractor shall educate providers and staff about the
                  nature of such problems and how to address them. The
                  contractor shall identify providers who have expertise in
                  serving persons with behavior problems.

         H.       ADA Compliance. The contractor shall have written policies and
                  procedures that ensure compliance with requirements of the
                  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and a written plan to
                  monitor compliance to determine the ADA requirements are being
                  met. The plan shall be sufficient to determine the specific
                  actions that will be taken to remove existing barriers and/or
                  to accommodate the needs of enrollees who are qualified
                  individuals with a disability. The plan shall include the
                  assurance of appropriate physical access to obtain included
                  benefits for all enrollees who are qualified individuals with
                  a disability including, but not limited to, the following:

                  1.       Street level access or accessible ramp into
                           facilities;

                  2.       Access to lavatory; and

                  3.       Access to examination rooms.

                  The contractor shall also address in its policies and
                  procedures regarding ADA compliance the following issues:

                  1.       Provider refusal to treat qualified individuals with
                           disabilities, including but not limited to
                           individuals with HIV/AIDS.

                  2.       Contractor's role in ensuring providers receive
                           available resource information on how to accommodate
                           qualified individuals with a

                                                                           IV-46

                           disability, particularly mobility impaired enrollees,
                           in examination rooms and for examinations.

                  3.       How the contractor will accommodate visual and
                           hearing impaired individuals and assist its providers
                           in communicating with these individuals.

                  4.       How the contractor will accommodate individuals with
                           communication-affecting disorders and assist its
                           providers in communicating with these individuals.

                  5.       Holding community events as part of its provider and
                           consumer education responsibilities in places of
                           public accommodation, i.e., facilities readily
                           accessible to and useable by qualified individuals
                           with disabilities.

                  6.       How the contractor will ensure it will link qualified
                           individuals with disabilities with the
                           providers/specialists with the knowledge and
                           expertise in treating the illness, condition, and
                           special needs of the enrollees.

                           children and adults with complex/chronic or disabling
                           conditions. To the extent possible, children and
                           adults with complex physical conditions should be in
                           the care of board certified pediatricians and family
                           practitioners or internists, respectively, or
                           subspecialists, as appropriate.

                                                                           IV-47
<PAGE>
                  4.       The network shall include adult and pediatric
                           subspecialists for cardiology, hematology/oncology,
                           gastroenterology, emergency medicine, endocrinology,
                           infectious disease, orthopedics, neurology,

                           pediatrics, adolescent health, geriatrics, and
                           chronic illness management.

                  5.       The network shall include an appropriate and
                           accessible number of institutional facilities,
                           professional allied personnel, home care and

                           contractor-covered services included in this
                           contract.

         B.       SCHSNA. The contractor shall include in its provider network
                  Special Child Health Services Network Agencies (SCHSNA) for
                  children with special health care needs. These agencies are
                  designated and approved by the Department of Health and Senior
                  Services and include Pediatric Ambulatory Tertiary Centers
                  (pediatric tertiary centers may also be used when a pediatric
                  subspecialty is not sufficiently accessible in a county to
                  meet the needs of the child), Regional Cleft Lip/Palate
                  Centers, Pediatric AIDS/HIV Network, Comprehensive Regional

                  Hemophilia Treatment Centers, and others as designated from
                  time to time by the Department of Health and Senior Services.
                  A list of such providers is found in Section B.4.10 of the
                  Appendices.

         C.       Credentialing. The contractor shall collect and maintain, as
                  part of its credentialing process or through special survey
                  process, information from licensed practitioners including
                  pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists about the nature
                  and extent of their experience in serving children with
                  special health care needs including developmental
                  disabilities.

4.5.4    CARE MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION OF CARE FOR PERSONS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS

         A.       The contractor shall provide coordination of care to actively
                  link the enrollee to providers, medical services, residential,
                  social and other support services as needed. For persons with
                  special needs, care management shall be provided, but, for
                  those with higher needs, as determined through the Complex
                  Needs Assessment (the CNA is described in Article 4.6.5), the
                  contractor shall provide care management at a higher level of
                  intensity. (See Section B.4.12 of the Appendices for a
                  flowchart of the three levels of care management.) Specific
                  requirements for this highest level of care management are
                  described below.

         B.       Complex Needs Assessment. For enrollees with special needs,
                  the contractor shall perform a Complex Needs Assessment no
                  later than thirty (30) days (or

                                                                           IV-48
<PAGE>
                  earlier, if urgent) from initial enrollment if special needs
                  are indicated on the Plan Selection Form or from the point of
                  identification of special needs. See 4.6.5 for a description
                  of the CNA.

         C.       Experience and Caseload. Care managers for enrollees who
                  require a higher level of care management will have the same
                  role and responsibilities as the care manager for the lower
                  intensity care management and additionally will address the
                  complex intensive needs of the enrollee identified as being at
                  "high risk" of adverse medical outcomes absent active
                  intervention by the contractor. For example, a
                  visually-impaired, insulin-dependent diabetic who requires
                  frequent glucose monitoring, nutritional guidance, vision
                  checks, and assistance in coordination with visits with
                  multiple providers, therapeutic regimen, etc. The contractor
                  shall provide intensive acute care services to treat
                  individuals with multiple complex conditions. The number of
                  medical and social services required by an enrollee in this
                  level of care management will generally be greater, thus the
                  number of linkages to be created, maintained, and monitored,
                  including the promotion of communication among providers and
                  the consumer and of continuity of care, will be greater. The
                  contractor shall provide these enrollees greater assistance
                  with scheduling appointments/visits. The intensity and
                  frequency of interaction with the enrollee and other members
                  of the treatment team will also be greater. The care manager
                  shall contact the enrollee bi-weekly or as needed.

                  1.       At a minimum, the care manager for this level of care
                           management shall include, but is not limited to,
                           individuals with an undergraduate or graduate degree
                           in nursing or a graduate degree in social work and
                           with at least two (2) years experience serving
                           enrollees with special needs.

                  2.       The contractor shall ensure that the care manager's
                           caseload is adjusted, as needed, to accommodate the
                           work and level of effort needed to meet the needs of
                           the entire case mix of assigned enrollees including
                           those determined to be high risk.

                  3.       The contractor should include care managers with
                           experience working with pediatric as well as adult
                           enrollees with special needs.

         D.       IHCPs. The contractor through its care manager shall ensure
                  that an Individual Health Care Plan (IHCP) is developed and
                  implemented as soon as possible, according to the
                  circumstances of the enrollee. The contractor shall ensure the
                  full participation and consent of the enrollee or, where
                  applicable, authorized person and participation of the
                  enrollee's PCP and other case managers identified through the
                  Complex Needs Assessment (e.g. DDD case manager) in the
                  development of the plan.

         E.       The contractor shall provide written notification to the
                  enrollee, or authorized person, of the level of care
                  management approved and the name of the care

                                                                           IV-49
<PAGE>
                  manager as soon as the IHCP is completed. The contractor shall
                  have a mechanism to allow for changing levels of care
                  management as needs change.

         F.       Offering of Service. The contractor shall offer and document
                  the enrollee's response for this higher level care management
                  to enrollees (or, where applicable, authorized persons) who,
                  upon completion of a Complex Needs Assessment, are determined
                  to have complex needs which merit development of an IHCP and
                  comprehensive service coordination by a care manager.
                  Enrollees shall have the right to decline coordination of care
                  services; however, such refusal does not preclude the
                  contractor from case managing the enrollee's care.

4.5.5    CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS

         A.       The contractor shall provide services to children with special
                  health care needs, who may have or are suspected of having
                  serious or chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or
                  emotional conditions (short-term, intermittent, persistent, or
                  terminal), who manifest some degree of delay or disability in
                  one or more of the following areas: communication, cognition,
                  mobility, self-direction, and self-care; and with specified
                  clinically significant disturbance of thought, behavior,
                  emotions, or relationships that can be described as a syndrome
                  or pattern, generally resulting from neurochemical
                  dysfunction, negative environmental influences, or some
                  combination of both. Services needed by these children may
                  include but are not limited to psychiatric care and substance
                  abuse counseling for DDD clients (appropriate referrals for
                  all other pediatric enrollees); medications; crisis
                  intervention; inpatient hospital services; and intensive care
                  management to assure adherence to treatment requirements.

         B.       The contractor shall be responsible for establishing:

                  1.       Methods for well child care, health promotion, and
                           disease prevention, specialty care for those who

                           strategies, home therapies, and ongoing ancillary
                           services, as well as the long-term management of
                           ongoing medical complications.

                  2.       Care management systems for assuring that children
                           with serious, chronic, and rare disorders receive
                           appropriate diagnostic work-ups on a timely basis.

                  3.       Access to specialty centers in and out of New Jersey
                           for diagnosis and treatment of rare disorders. A
                           listing of specialty centers is included in Section
                           B.4.10 of the Appendices.

                  4.       Policies and procedures to allow for continuation of
                           existing relationships with out-of-network providers,
                           when considered to be in the best medical interest of
                           the enrollee.

                                                                           IV-50
<PAGE>
         C.       Linkages. The contractor shall have methods for coordinating
                  care and creating linkages with external organizations,
                  including but not limited to school districts, child
                  protective service agencies, early intervention agencies,
                  behavioral health, and developmental disabilities service
                  organizations. At a minimum, linkages shall address:

                  1.       Contractor's process for generating or receiving
                           referrals, and sharing information;

                  2.       Contractor's process for obtaining consent from
                           enrollees or, where applicable, authorized persons to
                           share individual beneficiary medical information; and

                  3.       Ongoing coordination efforts (regularly scheduled
                           meetings, newsletters, joint community based
                           project).

         D.       IEPs. The contractor shall cooperate with school districts to
                  provide medically necessary contractor-covered services when
                  included as a recommendation in an enrollee's Individualized
                  Education Program (IEP) developed by the school district's
                  child study team, e.g. recommended medications or DME. The
                  contractor shall work with local school districts to develop
                  and implement procedures for linking and coordinating services
                  for children who need to receive medical services under an
                  Individualized Education Plan, in order to prevent duplication
                  of services, and to provide for cost effective services. Those
                  services which are included in the IEP as required services
                  are paid for by the school district, e.g. physical therapy.

                  this contract, or not available under EPSDT are not the
                  contractor's responsibility. The provision of services shall
                  be based on medical necessity as defined in this contract.

         E.       Early Intervention. The contractor shall cooperate with and
                  coordinate its services with local Early Intervention Programs
                  to provide medically necessary (as defined in this contract)
                  contractor-covered services included in the Individualized
                  Family Support Plan (IFSP). These programs are comprehensive,
                  community based programs of integrated developmental services
                  which use a family centered approach to facilitate the
                  developmental progress of children between the ages of birth
                  and three (3) years of age whose developmental patterns are
                  atypical, or are at serious risk to become atypical through
                  the influence of certain biological or environmental risk
                  factors. At a minimum, the contractor must have policies and
                  procedures for identifying children who are candidates for
                  early intervention, making referrals through Special Child
                  Health Services County Case Management Units (See Appendix
                  B.4.11) in accordance with the Department of Health and Senior
                  Services procedures for referrals, and sharing information
                  with early intervention providers.

                                                                           IV-51

         Q.       Quality Improvement Projects (QIPs). The contractor shall
                  participate in QIPs defined annually by the State with input
                  from the contractor. The State will, with input from the
                  contractor and possibly other MCEs, define measurable
                  improvement goals and QIP-specific measures which shall serve
                  as the focus for each QIP. The contractor shall be responsible
                  for designing and implementing strategies for achieving each
                  QIP's objectives. At the beginning of each contract year the
                  contractor shall present a plan for designing and implementing
                  such strategies, which shall receive approval from the State
                  prior to implementation. The contractor shall then submit
                  semiannual progress reports summarizing performance relative
                  to each of the objectives of each contract year.

                  For year one the QIPs shall be the two areas identified below.
                  The external review organization (ERO) under contract with DHS
                  shall prepare a final report for year one that will contain
                  data, using State-approved sampling and measurement
                  methodologies, for each of the two measures below. Future
                  contract year QIPs shall be defined by the DHS and
                  incorporated into the contract by amendment.

                  For each measure the DHS will identify a baseline and a
                  compliance standard. The baselines in the following chart are
                  the year one QIPs. They are based on 1995 and 1996 focused
                  studies conducted by the ERO or MCE self-reported data (for
                  immunizations). Baseline data, target standards, and
                  compliance standards shall be established or updated by the
                  State.

                  If DHS determines that the contractor is not in compliance
                  with the requirements of the annual QIP objectives, either
                  based on the contractor's progress report or the ERO's report,
                  the contractor shall prepare and submit a corrective action
                  plan for DHS approval.

                  Consumer Assessments of Health Plans Study (CAHPS) survey, or
                  another survey instrument specified by the State. The survey

                  selection, and implementation methodology shall be determined
                  by the State, with contractor input, to assure comparability
                  of results across State contractors.

                  administrator to the State, in a format approved by the State,
                  by a date specified by the State of each contract year. Within

                  results sent to the contractor, it shall identify leading
                  sources of enrollee dissatisfaction, specify additional
                  measurement or intervention efforts developed to address
                  enrollee dissatisfaction, and a timeline, subject to State
                  approval, indicating when such activities will be completed. A

                  efforts shall be submitted to the State by a date specified by
                  DMAHS. The contractor shall respond to and submit a corrective
                  action to address and correct problems and deficiencies found
                  through the survey.

                  own, it shall send to DMAHS the results of the survey.

         X.       Focus Groups. The State will annually conduct four focus
                  groups with enrolled populations identified by the State and
                  communicated in writing to the contractor. Objectives for the
                  focus groups will be collaboratively developed by the State
                  and the contractor. For the first contract year, two focus
                  groups each will be conducted with enrollees who have
                  communication-affecting disorders and with enrollees who are
                  elderly.

                  Focus group results will be reported by the State. The
                  contractor shall identify opportunities for improvement
                  identified through the focus groups, specify

                                                                           IV-66

                  subject to State approval, indicating when such activities
                  will be completed. A status report on the additional
                  measurement or intervention efforts shall be submitted
                  annually to the State by a date specified by DMAHS.

                  by the contractor shall be sent/processed within two (2)
                  working days of the request, one (1) day for urgent cases. The
                  contractor shall have procedures to allow enrollees to receive
                  a standing referral to a specialist in cases where an enrollee
                  needs ongoing specialty care.

         C.       The contractor shall not impose an arbitrary number of
                  attempted dental treatment visits by a PCD as a condition
                  prior to the PCD initiating any specialty referral requests.

                                                                           IV-68

         D.       The contractor shall authorize any reasonable referral request
                  from a PCP/PCD without imposing any financial penalties to the
                  same PCP/PCD.

         E.       All final decisions regarding denials of referrals, PAs,
                  treatment and treatment plans for non-emergency services shall
                  be made by a physician and/or peer physician specialist or by
                  a dentist/dental specialist in the case of dental services.
                  Prior authorization decisions for non-emergency services shall
                  be made within ten (10) business days or sooner as required by
                  the needs of the enrollee.

4.6.4    UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT

         A.       Utilization Review Plan. The contractor shall develop a
                  written Utilization Review Plan that includes all standards
                  described in the NJ modified QARI/QISMC (See Section B.4.14 of
                  the Appendices). The written plan shall also include policies
                  and procedures that address the following:

                  1.       The contractor shall not deny benefits to require
                           enrollees and providers to go through the appeal
                           process in an effort to forestall and reduce needed
                           benefits. The contractor shall provide all medically
                           necessary services covered by the NJ Division of
                           Medical Assistance and Health Services program in
                           this contract. If a dispute arises concerning the
                           provision of a service or the level of service, the
                           service, if initiated, shall be continued until the
                           issue is resolved.

                  2.       Utilization Management Committee. The committee shall
                           have written parameters for operating and will meet
                           on a regular schedule, defined to be at least
                           quarterly. Committee members shall be clearly
                           identified and representative of the contractor's
                           providers, accountable to the medical director and
                           governing body, and shall maintain appropriate
                           documentation of the committee's activities,
                           findings, recommendations, and actions.

                  3.       Data Collection and Reporting. The plan shall provide
                           for systematic utilization data collection and
                           analysis, including profiling of provider utilization
                           patterns and patient results. The contractor must use
                           aggregate data to establish utilization patterns,
                           allow for trend analysis, and develop statistical
                           profiles of both individual providers and all network
                           providers. Such data shall be regularly reported to
                           the contractor management and contractor providers.
                           The plan shall also provide for interpretation of the
                           data to providers.

                  4.       Corrective Action. The plan shall include procedures
                           for corrective action and follow-up activities when
                           problems in utilization are identified.

                                                                           IV-69
<PAGE>
                  5.       Roles and Responsibilities. The plan shall clearly
                           define the roles, functions, and responsibilities of
                           the utilization management committee and medical
                           director.

                  6.       Prohibitions on Compensation. The contractor or the
                           contractor's delegated utilization review agent shall
                           not permit or provide compensation or anything of
                           value to its employees, agents or contractors based
                           on:

                           a.       Either a percentage of the amount by which a
                                    claim is reduced for payment or the number
                                    of claims or the cost of services for which
                                    the person has denied authorization or
                                    payment; or

                           b.       Any other method that encourages the
                                    rendering of an adverse determination.

                  7.       Retrospective Review. If a health care service has
                           been pre-authorized or approved, the specific
                           standards, criteria or procedures used in the
                           determination shall not be modified pursuant to
                           retrospective review.

                  8.       Collection of Information. Only such information as
                           is necessary to make a determination shall be
                           collected. During prospective or concurrent review,
                           copies of medical records shall only be required when
                           necessary to verify that the health care services
                           subject to review are medically necessary. In such
                           cases, only the relevant sections of the records
                           shall be required. Complete or partial medical
                           records may be requested for retrospective reviews.
                           In no event shall such information be reviewed by
                           persons other than health care professionals,
                           registered health information technicians, registered
                           health information administrators, or administrative
                           personnel who have received appropriate training and
                           who will safeguard patient confidentiality.

                  9.       Prohibited Actions. Neither the contractor's UM
                           committee nor its utilization review agent shall take
                           any action with respect to an enrollee or a health
                           care provider that is intended to penalize or
                           discourage the enrollee or the enrollee's health care
                           provider from undertaking an appeal, dispute
                           resolution or judicial review of an adverse
                           determination.

         B.       Prior Authorization. The contractor shall have policies and
                  procedures for prior-authorization. Prior authorization shall
                  be conducted by a currently licensed, registered or certified
                  health care professional, including a registered nurse or a
                  physician who is appropriately trained in the principles,
                  procedures and standards of utilization review. The following
                  timeframes and requirements shall apply to all prior
                  authorization determinations:

                                                                           IV-70

                  1.       Routine determinations. Prior authorization
                           determinations for non-urgent services shall be made

                           and in writing to the provider within ten (10)
                           business days (or sooner as required by the needs of
                           the enrollee) of receipt of necessary information
                           sufficient to make an informed decision.

                  2.       Urgent determinations. Prior authorization
                           determinations for urgent services shall be made

                           necessary information.

                  3.       Determination for Services that have been delivered.
                           Determinations involving health care services which
                           have been delivered shall be made within thirty (30)
                           days of receipt of the necessary information.

                  4.       Adverse Determinations. A physician and/or a
                           physician peer reviewer shall make the final
                           determination in all adverse determinations.

                  5.       Continued/Extended Services. A utilization review
                           agent shall make a determination involving continued
                           or extended health care services, or additional
                           services for an enrollee undergoing a course of
                           continued treatment prescribed by a health care
                           provider and provide notice of such determination to
                           the enrollee or the enrollee's designee, which may be
                           satisfied by notices to the enrollee's health care
                           provider, by telephone and in writing within one (1)
                           business day of receipt of the necessary information.
                           Notification of continued or extended services shall
                           include the number of extended services approved, the
                           new total of approved services, the date of onset of
                           services and the next review date. For services that
                           require multiple visits, a series of tests, etc. to
                           complete the service, the authorized time period
                           shall be adequate to cover the anticipated span of
                           time that best fits the service needs and
                           circumstances of each individual enrollee.

                  6.       Reconsiderations. The contractor shall have policies
                           and procedures for reconsideration in the event that
                           an adverse determination is made without an attempt
                           to discuss such determination with the referring
                           provider. Determinations in such cases shall be made
                           within the timeframes established for initial
                           considerations.

                           enrollees and/or, where applicable, an authorized
                           person at the time of denial, deferral or
                           modification of a request for prior approval to
                           provide a medical/dental service(s), when the
                           following conditions exist:

                           a.       The request is made by a medical/dental or
                                    other health care provider who has a formal
                                    arrangement with the contractor to provide
                                    services to the enrollee.

                                                                           IV-71
<PAGE>
                           b.       The request is made by the provider through
                                    the formal prior authorization procedures
                                    operated by the contractor.

                           c.       The service for which prior authorization is
                                    requested is a Medicaid covered service for
                                    which the contractor has established a prior
                                    authorization requirement.

                                    made at the ultimate level of responsibility
                                    within the contractor's organization for
                                    approving, denying, deferring or modifying
                                    the service requested but prior to the point
                                    at which the enrollee must initiate the
                                    contractor's grievance procedure.

                  8.       Notice of Action. Written notification shall be given

                           be required in the case of a deceased patient, or
                           when an enrollee has relocated and cannot be found),

                           c.       The enrollee's PCP requests an assessment;

                           d.       A State agency involved with an enrollee
                                    requests an assessment; or

                           e.       An enrollee's status otherwise indicates.

         D.       Plan of Care. The contractor, through its care manager, shall
                  ensure that a plan of care is developed and implementation has
                  begun within thirty (30) business days of the date of a needs
                  assessment, or sooner, according to the circumstances of the
                  enrollee. The contractor shall ensure the full participation
                  and consent of the enrollee or, where applicable, authorized
                  person and participation of the enrollee's PCP and other case
                  managers identified through the Complex Needs Assessment
                  (e.g., DDD case manager) in the development of the plan. The
                  plan shall specify treatment goals, identify medical service
                  needs, relevant social and support services, appropriate
                  linkages and timeframe as well as provide an ongoing accurate
                  record of the individual's clinical history. The care manager
                  shall be responsible for implementing the linkages identified
                  in the plan and monitoring the provision of services
                  identified in the plan. This includes making referrals,
                  coordinating care, promoting communication, ensuring
                  continuity of care, and conducting follow-up. The care manager
                  shall also be responsible for ensuring that the plan is
                  updated as needed, but at least annually. This includes early
                  identification of changes in the enrollee's needs.

         E.       Referrals. The contractor shall have policies and procedures
                  to process and respond within ten (10) business days to care
                  management referrals from network providers, state agencies,
                  private agencies under contract with DDD, self-referrals, or,
                  where applicable, referrals from an authorized person.

         F.       Continuity of Care

                  1.       The contractor shall establish and operate a system
                           to assure that a comprehensive treatment plan for
                           every enrollee will progress to completion in a
                           timely manner without unreasonable interruption.

                  2.       The contractor shall construct and maintain policies
                           and procedures to ensure continuity of care by each
                           provider in its network.

                  3.       An enrollee shall not suffer unreasonable
                           interruption of his/her active treatment plan. Any
                           interruptions beyond the control of the provider will
                           not be deemed a violation of this requirement.

                  4.       If an enrollee has already had a medical or dental
                           treatment procedure initiated prior to his/her
                           enrollment in the contractor's plan, the initiating
                           treating provider must complete that procedure (not
                           the entire treatment plan). See 4.1.1.E for details.

                                                                           IV-77

                  specialists of the availability of care management services,
                  and must develop protocols describing how providers will
                  coordinate services with the care managers.

         I.       Care Managers. The contractor shall establish a distinct care

                  described in Article 7.3. Care managers shall be dedicated to
                  providing care management and may be employees or contracted
                  agents of the contractor. The care manager, in conjunction
                  with and with approval from, the enrollee's PCP, shall make
                  referrals to needed services. The care management system shall
                  recognize three levels set forth in Section B.4.12 of the
                  Appendices. Level 3 is described in Article 4.5.4.

                  1.       The care manager for the first level of care
                           management shall have as a minimum a license as a

                  2.       For level two of care management, in addition to the
                           requirements in 4.6.5I.1. above, the care managers
                           shall also have at least one (1) year of experience
                           serving enrollees with special needs.

                  3.       The contractor shall have procedures to monitor the
                           adequacy of staffing and must adjust staffing ratios
                           and caseloads as appropriate based on its staffing
                           assessment.

         J.       Care management shall also be made available to enrollees who
                  exhibit inappropriate, disruptive or threatening behaviors in
                  a medical practitioner's office when such behaviors may relate
                  to or result from the existence of the enrollee's special
                  needs.

         K.       Hours of Service. The contractor shall make care management
                  services available during normal office hours, Monday through
                  Friday.

                  scope of services to be provided, and coverage arrangements
                  documenting twenty-four (24) hours/seven (7) days a week

         B.       The PCP shall be responsible for supervising, coordinating,
                  managing the enrollee's health care, providing initial and
                  primary care to each enrollee, for initiating referrals for
                  specialty care, maintaining continuity of each enrollee's
                  health care and maintaining the enrollee's comprehensive
                  medical record which includes documentation of all services
                  provided to the enrollee by the PCP, as well as any specialty
                  or referral services. The contractor shall establish policies
                  and procedures to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of
                  specialty and referral services. PCPs who provide professional
                  inpatient services to the contractor's enrollees shall have
                  admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one general
                  acute care hospital that is under subcontract with the
                  contractor and is located within the contractor's service
                  area. The PCP shall be an individual, not a facility, group or
                  association of persons, although he/she may practice in a
                  facility, group or clinic setting.

                  1.       The PCP shall provide twenty-four (24) hour, seven
                           (7) day a week access; and

                  2.       Make referrals for specialty care and other medically
                           necessary services, both in-network and out-of-
                           network.

                  3.       Enrollees with special needs requiring very complex,
                           highly specialized health care services over a
                           prolonged period of time, and by virtue of their
                           nature and complexity would be difficult for a
                           traditional PCP to manage or with a life-threatening
                           condition or disease, or with a degenerative and/or
                           disabling condition or disease may be offered the
                           option of selecting an appropriate physician
                           specialist (where available) in lieu of a traditional
                           PCP. Such physicians having the clinical skills,
                           capacity, accessibility, and availability shall be
                           specially credentialed and contractually obligated to
                           assume the responsibility for overall health care
                           coordination and assuring that the special needs
                           person receives all necessary specialty care related
                           to their special need, as well as providing for or
                           arranging all routine preventive care and health
                           maintenance services, which may not customarily be
                           provided by or the responsibility of such specialist
                           physicians.

                  4.       Where a specialist acting as a PCP is not available
                           for chronically ill persons or enrollees with complex
                           health care needs, those enrollees shall have the
                           option to select a traditional PCP upon enrollment,
                           with the understanding that the contractor may permit
                           a more liberal, direct specialty access (See section
                           4.5.2) to a specific specialist for the explicit
                           purpose of meeting those specific specialty service
                           needs. The PCP shall in this case retain all
                           responsibility for provision of primary care services
                           and for overall coordination of care, including
                           specialty care.

                  5.       If the enrollee's existing PCP is a participating
                           provider in the contractor's network, and if the
                           enrollee wishes to retain the PCP, contractor shall

                                                                           IV-87
<PAGE>
                           ensure that the PCP is assigned, even if the PCP's
                           panel is otherwise closed at the time of the
                           enrollee's enrollment.

         C.       In addition to offering, at a minimum, a choice of two or more
                  primary care physicians, the contractor shall also offer an
                  enrollee or, where applicable, an authorized person the option
                  of choosing a certified nurse midwife, certified nurse
                  practitioner or clinical nurse specialist whose services must
                  be provided within the scope of his/her license. The
                  contractor shall submit to DMAHS for review a detailed
                  description of the CNP/CNS's responsibilities and health care
                  delivery system within the contractor's plan.

                  and the enrollee or, where applicable, authorized person. Such
                  treatment plan may limit the number of visits or the period
                  during which such visits are authorized and may require the
                  specialist to provide the primary care provider with regular
                  updates on the specialty care provided, as well as all
                  necessary medical information.

                                                                           IV-91

                  specialist or specialty care center with expertise in treating
                  such conditions in lieu of a traditional PCP.

         G.       If the contractor determines that it does not have a health
                  care provider with appropriate training and experience in its
                  panel or network to meet the particular health care needs of
                  an enrollee, the contractor shall make a referral to an
                  appropriate out-of-network provider, pursuant to a treatment
                  plan approved by the contractor in consultation with the
                  primary care provider, the non-contractor participating
                  provider and the enrollee or where applicable, authorized
                  person, at no additional cost to the enrollee. The contractor
                  shall provide for a review by a specialist of the same or
                  similar specialty as the type of physician or provider to whom
                  a referral is requested before the contractor may deny a
                  referral.

                  have regulatory approval prior to the effective date. Any
                  proposed change(s) to an approved subcontracting arrangement
                  including any proposed changes to approved contract forms
                  shall be reviewed and prior approved by the DMAHS and shall
                  have regulatory approval from DHSS and DOBI prior to the
                  effective date. The contractor shall comply with all DMAHS
                  procedures for contract review and approval submissions.

         C.       The contractor shall at all times have satisfactory written
                  contracts and subcontracts with a sufficient number of
                  providers in and adjacent to the enrollment area to ensure
                  enrollee access to all medically necessary services listed in
                  Article 4.1. All provider contracts and subcontracts shall
                  meet established requirements, form and contents approved by
                  DMAHS.

         D.       The contractor, in performing its duties and obligations
                  hereunder, shall have the right either to employ its own
                  employees and agents or, for the provision of health care

                  Department to assure that all activities under this contract
                  are carried out. The contractor is not relieved of its
                  contractual responsibilities to the Department by delegating
                  responsibility to a subcontractor.

         F.       All provider contracts and subcontracts shall be in writing
                  and shall fulfill the requirements of 42 C.F.R. Part 434 that

                  subcontract.

                  1.       Provider contracts and subcontracts shall contain
                           provisions allowing DMAHS and HHS to evaluate through
                           inspection or other means, the quality,
                           appropriateness and timeliness of services performed
                           under a subcontract to provide medical services (42
                           C.F.R. Section 434.6(a)(5)).

                  2.       Provider contracts and subcontracts shall contain
                           provisions pertaining to the maintenance of an
                           appropriate record system for services to enrollees.
                           (42 C.F.R. Section 434.6(a)(7))

                  3.       Each provider contract and subcontract shall contain
                           sufficient provisions to safeguard all rights of
                           enrollees and to ensure that the subcontract complies
                           with all applicable State and federal laws, including
                           confidentiality. See Section B.7.2 of the Appendices.

                                                                          IV-104
<PAGE>
                  4.       Provider contracts and subcontracts shall include the
                           specific provisions and verbatim language found in
                           Appendix B.7.2. The verbatim language requirements
                           shall be used when entering into new provider
                           contracts, new subcontracts, and when renewing,
                           renegotiating or recontracting with providers and

                  ownership/control information of participating providers and

                  updated every quarter.

                  1.       The contractor shall obtain prior DMAHS review and
                           written approval of any proposed plan for merger,
                           reorganization or change in ownership of the
                           contractor and approval by the appropriate State
                           regulatory agencies.

                  2.       The contractor shall comply with Article 4.9.1G.1 to
                           ensure uninterrupted and undiminished services to
                           enrollees, to evaluate the ability of the modified
                           entity to support the provider network, and to ensure
                           that any such change has no adverse effects on
                           DMAHS's managed care program and shall comply with
                           the Departments of Banking and Insurance, and Health

                  state licensure regulations.

                  with a schedule of fees and relevant policies and procedures
                  at least 30 days prior to implementation.

         K.       The contractor shall arrange for the distribution of
                  informational materials to all its providers and
                  subcontractors providing services to enrollees, outlining the
                  nature, scope, and requirements of this contract.

                  high-ranking officer with decision-making authority.

4.9.3    PROVIDER CONTRACT AND SUBCONTRACT TERMINATION

         A.       The contractor shall comply with all the provisions of the New
                  Jersey HMO regulations at N.J.A.C. 8:38 et seq. regarding
                  provider termination, including but not limited to 30 day
                  prior written notice to enrollees and continuity of care
                  requirements.

         B.       The contractor shall notify DMAHS at least 30 days prior to
                  the effective date of suspension, termination, or voluntary
                  withdrawal of a provider or subcontractor from participation
                  in this program. If the termination was "for cause," the
                  contractor's notice to DMAHS shall include the reasons for the
                  termination.

                  1.       Provider resource consumption patterns shall not
                           constitute "cause" unless the contractor can
                           demonstrate it has in place a risk adjustment system
                           that takes into account enrollee health-related
                           differences when comparing across providers.

                  2.       The contractor shall assure immediate coverage by a
                           provider of the same specialty, expertise, or service
                           provision and shall submit a new contract with a
                           replacement provider to DMAHS within 30 days of being
                           finalized.

         C.       If a primary care provider ceases participation in the
                  contractor's organization, the contractor shall provide
                  written notice at least thirty (30) days from the date that
                  the contractor becomes aware of such change in status to each
                  enrollee who has chosen the provider as their primary care
                  provider. If an enrollee is in an ongoing course of treatment
                  with any other participating provider who becomes unavailable
                  to continue to provide services to such enrollee and
                  contractor is aware of such ongoing course of treatment, the
                  contractor shall provide written notice within fifteen days
                  from the date that the contractor becomes aware of such
                  unavailability to such enrollee. Each notice shall also
                  describe the procedures for continuing care and choice of
                  other providers who can continue to care for the enrollee.

                                                                          IV-107
<PAGE>
         D.       All provider contracts shall contain a provision that states
                  that the contractor shall not terminate the contract with a
                  provider because the provider expresses disagreement with a
                  contractor's decision to deny or limit benefits to a covered
                  person or because the provider assists the covered person to
                  seek reconsideration of the contractor's decision; or because
                  a provider discusses with a current, former, or prospective
                  patient any aspect of the patient's medical condition, any
                  proposed treatments or treatment alternatives, whether covered
                  by the contractor or not, policy provisions of a plan, or a
                  provider's personal recommendation regarding selection of a
                  health plan based on the provider's personal knowledge of the
                  health needs of such patients. Nothing in this Article shall
                  be construed to prohibit the contractor from:

                  1.       Including in its provider contracts a provision that
                           precludes a provider from making, publishing,
                           disseminating, or circulating directly or indirectly
                           or aiding, abetting, or encouraging the making,
                           publishing, disseminating, or circulating of any oral
                           or written statement or any pamphlet, circular,
                           article, or literature that is false or maliciously
                           critical of the contractor and calculated to injure
                           the contractor; or

                  2.       Terminating a contract with a provider because such
                           provider materially misrepresents the provisions,
                           terms, or requirements of the contractor.

4.9.4    PROHIBITION OF INTERFERENCE WITH CERTAIN MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS

         A.       Any contract between the contractor in relation to health
                  coverage and a health care provider (or group of health care
                  providers) shall not prohibit or restrict the provider from
                  engaging in medical communications with the provider's
                  patient, either explicit or implied, nor shall any provider
                  manual, newsletters, directives, letters, verbal instructions,
                  or any other form of communication prohibit medical
                  communication between the provider and the provider's patient.
                  Providers shall be free to communicate freely with their
                  patients about the health status of their patients, medical
                  care or treatment options regardless of whether benefits for
                  that care or treatment are provided under the contract, if the
                  professional is acting within the lawful scope of practice.
                  The health care providers shall be free to practice their
                  respective professions in providing the most appropriate
                  treatment required by their patients and shall provide
                  informed consent within the guidelines of the law including
                  possible positive and negative outcomes of the various
                  treatment modalities.

         B.       Nothing in this Article shall be construed:

                  contractor's denial, modification, or deferral of a prior
                  authorization request, the contractor shall present its
                  position for the denial, modification, or deferral of
                  procedures during Fair Hearing proceedings.

         G.       The contractor shall coordinate and provide court ordered
                  medical services (except sexual abuse evaluations). It is the
                  responsibility of the contractor to inform the courts about
                  the availability of its providers. If the court orders a
                  noncontractor source to provide the treatment or evaluation,
                  the contractor shall be liable for the cost up to the Medicaid
                  rate if the contractor could not have provided the service
                  through its own provider network or arrangements.

                  pregnant women, beyond the first trimester, who have an
                  established relationship with an obstetrician who is not a
                  participating provider in any contractor. These individuals
                  will be tracked and enrolled after sixty (60) days postpartum.

         B.       Individuals with a terminal illness and who have an
                  established relationship with a physician who is not a
                  participating provider in any contractor's plan.

         C.       Individuals with a chronic, debilitating illness or disability
                  who have received treatment from a physician and/or team of
                  providers with expertise in treating that illness with whom
                  the individuals have an established relationship (greater than
                  12 months) and who are not participating in any contractor;
                  and there is no other reasonable alternative as determined by
                  DMAHS at its sole discretion. Such requests shall be reviewed
                  by DMAHS on a case by case basis. The individuals or
                  authorized persons must provide written documentation
                  identifying all of the providers who provide regular, ongoing
                  care and who will certify their continued involvement in the

                  detailing how and who will provide medical management for the
                  individual.

                  1.       Temporary exemption may be granted by DMAHS to allow
                           the contractor time to contract with a specific
                           specialist needed by an enrollee with whom there is a
                           long-standing established relationship (greater than

                           specialist available in the network. The contractor
                           shall establish appropriate contractual/referral
                           relationships with any or all specialists needed to
                           accommodate the needs of enrollees with special
                           needs.

         D.       Individuals who do not speak English or Spanish and who meet
                  the following criteria: i) have an illness requiring on-going
                  treatment; ii) have an established relationship with a
                  physician who speaks their primary language; and iii) there is
                  no available primary care physician in any participating
                  contractor who speaks the beneficiary's language. These cases
                  shall be reviewed by DMAHS on a case-bycase basis with no
                  automatic exemption from initial enrollment.

         E.       Individuals who do not have a choice of at least two (2) PCPs
                  within thirty (30) miles of their residence.

                  plan for dissemination to Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare
                  beneficiaries.

                  District Offices) and county offices (e.g. Offices on Aging
                  for grandparent caretakers).

         C.       Automatic Assignment. Medicaid eligible persons who reside in

                  contractor shall not condition any Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare
                  eligible person's enrollment upon the performance of any act
                  or suggest in any way that failure to enroll may result in a
                  loss of Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare benefits.

                  of eligible enrollees.

                                            period. The contractor shall notify
                                            DMAHS of the birth immediately in
                                            order to assure payment for this
                                            period.

                           d.       Enrollee no longer in contract area. If an
                                    enrollee moves out of the contractor's
                                    enrollment area and would otherwise still be
                                    eligible to be enrolled in the contractor's
                                    plan, the contractor shall continue to
                                    provide or arrange benefits to the enrollee
                                    until the DMAHS can disenroll him/her. The
                                    contractor shall ask DMAHS to disenroll the
                                    enrollee due to the change of residence as
                                    soon as it becomes aware of the enrollee's
                                    relocation. This provision does not apply to
                                    persons with disabilities, who may elect to
                                    remain with the contractor, or to NJ
                                    FamilyCare Plans B, C, and D enrollees, who
                                    remain enrolled until the end of the month
                                    in which the 60th day after the request
                                    falls.

         H.       Enrollment Roster. The enrollment roster and weekly
                  transaction register generated by DMAHS shall serve as the
                  official contractor enrollment list. However, enrollment
                  changes can occur between the time when the monthly roster is
                  produced and capitation payment is made. The contractor shall
                  only be responsible for the provision and cost of care for an
                  enrollee during the months on which the enrollee's name
                  appears on the roster, except as indicated in Article 8.8.
                  DMAHS shall make available data on eligibility determinations
                  to the contractor to resolve discrepancies that may arise
                  between the roster and contractor enrollment files. If DMAHS
                  notifies the contractor in writing of changes in the roster,
                  the contractor shall rely upon that written notification in
                  the same manner as the roster. Corrective action shall be
                  limited to one (1) year from the date that the change was
                  effective.

         I.       Enrollment of Medicaid case. Enrollment shall be for the
                  entire Medicaid case, i.e., all individuals included under the
                  ten-digit Medicaid identification number (or 12-digit ID
                  number in the case of DYFS population). The contractor shall
                  not enroll a partial case except at the DMAHS' sole
                  discretion.

         J.       Weekly Enrollment Transactions. In keeping with a schedule
                  established by DMAHS, DMAHS will process and forward
                  enrollment transactions to the contractor on a weekly basis.

         K.       Capitation Recovery. Capitation payments for a full month
                  coverage shall be recovered from the contractor on a prorated
                  basis when an enrollee is admitted to a nursing facility,
                  psychiatric care facility or other institution including
                  incarceration and the individual is disenrolled from the
                  contractor's plan on the day prior to such admission.

         L.       Adjustments to Capitation. The monthly capitation payments
                  shall include all adjustments made by DMAHS for reasons such
                  as but not limited to retroactive validation as for newborns
                  or retroactive termination of eligibility as for death,

                                                                            V-9
<PAGE>
                  incarceration or institutionalization. These adjustments will
                  be documented by DMAHS by means of a remittance tape. With the
                  exception of newborns, DMAHS shall be responsible for
                  fee-for-service payments incurred by the enrollee during the
                  period prior to actual enrollment in the contractor's plan.

         M.       The contractor shall cooperate with established procedures
                  whereby DMAHS and the HBC shall monitor enrollment and
                  disenrollment practices.

         N.       Nothing in this Article or contract shall be construed to
                  limit or in any way jeopardize a Medicaid beneficiary's
                  eligibility for New Jersey Medicaid.

         O.       DMAHS shall arrange for the determination of eligibility of
                  each potential enrollee for covered services under this
                  contract and to arrange for the provision of complete
                  information to the contractor with respect to such
                  eligibility, including notification whenever an enrollee's
                  Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare eligibility is discontinued.

5.6      VERIFICATION OF ENROLLMENT

         A.       The contractor shall be responsible for keeping its network of
                  providers informed of the enrollment status of each enrollee.
                  The contractor shall be able to report and ensure enrollment
                  to network providers through electronic means.

         B.       The contractor shall maintain procedures to ensure that each
                  individual's enrollment in the contractor's plan may be
                  verified with the use of the Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare
                  Eligibility Identification Card issued by the State and/or

                  This information shall include, where known, the name of the
                  enrollee's provider of record, and a listing of all
                  participating providers in the contractor's network. (See
                  Article 4.8.4 for a description of the required listing.)

         C.       PCP Assignment. If the contractor has not received an
                  enrollee's PCP selection within ten (10) calendar days from
                  the enrollee's effective date of coverage or the selected
                  PCP's panel is closed, the contractor shall assign a PCP and
                  deliver an ID card by the fifteenth (15th) calendar day after
                  the effective date of enrollment. The assignment shall be made
                  according to the following criteria, in hierarchical order:

                  1.       The enrollee shall be assigned to his/her current
                           provider, if known, as long as that provider is a
                           part of the contractor's provider network.

                  2.       The enrollee shall be assigned to a PCP whose office
                           is within the travel time/distance standards, as
                           defined in Article 4.8.8. If the language and/or
                           cultural needs of the enrollee are known to the
                           contractor, the enrollee shall be assigned to a PCP
                           who is or has office staff who are linguistically and
                           culturally competent to communicate with the enrollee
                           or have the ability to interpret in the provision of
                           health care services and related activities during
                           the enrollee's office visits or contacts.

5.9.2    PCP CHANGES

         A.       Enrollee Request. Any enrollee or, where applicable,
                  authorized person dissatisfied with the PCP selected or
                  assigned shall be allowed to reselect or be assigned to
                  another PCP. Such reassignment shall become effective no later
                  than the beginning of the first month following a full month
                  after the request to change the enrollee's PCP. Except for
                  DYFS enrollees, this reselection or reassignment for any cause
                  may be limited, at the contractor's discretion, to two (2)
                  times per year. However, in the event there is reasonable
                  cause following policies and

                                                                           V-20
<PAGE>
                  procedures as determined by the contractor and approved by the
                  Department, the enrollee or, where applicable, authorized
                  person may reselect or be reassigned at any time, regardless
                  of the number of times the enrollee has previously changed
                  PCPs.

                  In the event an enrollee becomes non-eligible and then
                  re-eligible within six (6) months in the same region, said
                  enrollee shall, if at all possible, be assigned to the same
                  PCP. In such a circumstance, the contractor may count previous
                  PCP changes toward the annual two-change limit.

         B.       PCP Request. The contractor shall develop policies and
                  procedures, which shall be prior approved by the Department,
                  for allowing a PCP to request reassignment of an enrollee,
                  e.g., for irreconcilable differences, for when an enrollee has
                  taken legal action against the provider, or if an enrollee
                  fails to comply with health care instructions and such
                  non-compliance prevents the provider from safely and/or
                  ethically proceeding with that enrollee's health care
                  services. The contractor shall approve any reassignments and
                  require documentation of the reasons for the request for
                  reassignment. For example, if a PCP requests reassignment of
                  an enrollee for failure to comply with health care
                  instructions, the contractor shall take into consideration
                  whether the enrollee has a physical or developmental
                  disability that may contribute to the noncompliance, and
                  whether the provider has made reasonable efforts to
                  accommodate the enrollee's needs. In the case of DYFS-eligible
                  children, copies of such requests shall be sent to the
                  Division of Youth and Family Services, c/o Medicaid Liaison,
                  PO Box 717, Trenton, NJ 08625-0717.

         C.       PCP Change Form. If a change form is used, by the contractor,
                  the contractor shall immediately provide the PCP Change Form
                  to an enrollee wishing a change, if such request is made in
                  person, or by mail if requested by telephone or in writing.
                  The contractor shall mail the form within three (3) business
                  days of receiving a telephone or written request for a form.

         D.       Processing of PCP Change Forms. If a change form is used by
                  the contractor, enrollees shall submit the PCP change form to
                  the contractor for processing. The contractor shall process
                  the form and return the enrollee identification card or
                  self-adhering sticker to the enrollee within ten (10) calendar
                  days of the postmark date on the mailing envelope or, if not
                  received by mail, the date received by the contractor.

         E.       Verbal Requests for PCP Change. The contractor may accept
                  verbal requests from enrollees or authorized persons to change
                  PCPs. However, the contractor shall document the verbal
                  request including at a minimum name of caller, date of call,
                  and selected PCP. The contractor shall process the request and
                  return the enrollee identification card or self-adhering
                  sticker to the enrollee within ten (10) calendar days of the
                  request for PCP change.

                                                                           V-21

5.10.1   GENERAL PROVISIONS

         A.       Non-discrimination. Disenrollment from contractor's plan shall
                  not be based in whole or in part on an adverse change in the
                  enrollee's health, on any of the factors listed in Article
                  7.8, or on amounts payable to the contractor related to the
                  enrollee's participation in the contractor's plan.

         B.       Coverage. The contractor shall not be responsible for the
                  provision and cost of care and services for an enrollee after
                  the effective date of disenrollment unless the enrollee is
                  admitted to a hospital prior to the expected effective date of
                  disenrollment, in which case the contractor is responsible for
                  the provision and cost of care and services covered under this
                  contract until the date on which the enrollee is discharged
                  from the hospital, including any charge for the enrollee
                  readmitted within forty-eight (48) hours of discharge for the
                  same diagnosis.

         C.       Notification of Disenrollment Rights. The contractor shall
                  notify through personalized, written notification the enrollee
                  or, where applicable, authorized person of the enrollee's
                  disenrollment rights at least sixty (60) days prior to the end
                  of his/her twelve (12)-month enrollment period. The contractor
                  shall notify the enrollee of the effective disenrollment date

         D.       Release of Medical Records. The contractor shall transfer or
                  facilitate the transfer of the medical record (or copies of
                  the medical record), upon the enrollee's or, where applicable,
                  an authorized person's request, to either the enrollee, to the
                  receiving provider, or, in the case of a child eligible
                  through the Division of Youth and Family Services, to a
                  representative of the Division of Youth and Family Services or
                  to an adoptive parent receiving subsidy through DYFS, at no
                  charge, in a timely fashion, i.e., no later than ten days
                  prior to the effective date of transfer. The contractor shall
                  release medical records of the enrollee, and/or facilitate the
                  release of medical records in the possession of participating
                  providers as may be directed by DMAHS authorized personnel and
                  other appropriate agencies of the State of New Jersey, or the
                  federal government. Release of medical records shall be
                  consistent with the provisions of confidentiality as expressed
                  in Article 7.40 of this contract and the provisions of 42
                  C.F.R. Section 431.300. For individuals being served through
                  the Division of Youth and Family Services, release of medical
                  records must be in accordance with the provisions under
                  N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10a and 9:6-8.40 and consistent with the need
                  to protect the individual's confidentiality.

         E.       In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is
                  terminated, or expires, the contractor shall assist DMAHS in
                  the transition of enrollees to other contractors. Such
                  assistance and coordination shall include, but not be limited
                  to, the forwarding of medical and other records and the
                  facilitation and scheduling of medically necessary
                  appointments for care and services. The cost of reproducing

                                                                           V-22

                  and forwarding medical charts and other materials shall be
                  borne by the contractor. The contractor shall be responsible
                  for providing all reports set forth in this contract. The
                  contractor shall make provision for continuing all management
                  and administrative services until the transition of enrollees
                  is completed and all other requirements of this contract are
                  satisfied. The contractor shall be responsible for the
                  following:

                  1.       Identification and transition of chronically ill,
                           high risk and hospitalized enrollees, and enrollees
                           in their last four weeks of pregnancy.

                  2.       Transfer of requested medical records.

5.10.2   DISENROLLMENT FROM THE CONTRACTOR'S PLAN AT THE ENROLLEE'S REQUEST

         A.       An individual enrolled in a contractor's plan may be subject
                  to the enrollment Lock-In period provided for in this Article.
                  The enrollment Lock-In provision does not apply to SSI and New
                  Jersey Care ABD individuals, clients of DDD or to individuals
                  eligible to participate through the Division of Youth and
                  Family Services.

                  1.       An enrollee subject to the enrollment Lock-In period
                           may initiate disenrollment or transfer for any reason
                           during the first ninety (90) days after the latter of
                           the date the individual is enrolled or the date they
                           receive notice of enrollment with a new contractor
                           and at least every twelve (12) months thereafter
                           without cause. NJ FamilyCare Plans B, C, or D
                           enrollees will be subject to a twelve (12)-month
                           Lock-In period.

                           a.       The period during which an individual has
                                    the right to disenroll from the contractor's
                                    plan without cause applies to an
                                    individual's initial period of enrollment
                                    with the contractor. If that individual
                                    chooses to re-enroll with the contractor,
                                    his/her initial date of enrollment with the
                                    contractor will apply.

                  2.       An enrollee subject to the Lock-In period may
                           initiate disenrollment for good cause at any time.

                           a.       Good cause reasons for disenrollment or
                                    transfer shall include, unless otherwise
                                    defined by DMAHS:

                                    i.      Failure of the contractor to provide
                                            services including physical access
                                            to the enrollee in accordance with
                                            the terms of this contract;

                                    ii.     Enrollee has filed a grievance with
                                            the contractor pursuant to the
                                            applicable grievance procedure and
                                            has not received

                                                                           V-23
<PAGE>
                                            a response within the specified time
                                            period stated therein,or in a
                                            shorter time period required by
                                            federal law;

                                    iii.    Documented grievance, by the
                                            enrollee against the contractor's
                                            plan without satisfaction.

                                    iv.     Enrollee is subject to enrollment
                                            exemption as set forth in Article
                                            5.3.2. If an exemption situation
                                            exists within the contractor's plan
                                            but another contractor can
                                            accommodate the individual's needs,
                                            a transfer may be granted.

                                    v.      Enrollee has substantially more
                                            convenient access to a primary care
                                            physician who participates in
                                            another MCE in the same enrollment
                                            area.

         B.       Voluntary Disenrollment. The contractor shall assure that
                  enrollees who disenroll voluntarily are provided with an
                  opportunity to identify, in writing, their reasons for
                  disenrollment. The contractor shall further:

                  1.       Require the return, or invalidate the use of the
                           contractor's identification card; and

                  2.       Forward a copy of the disenrollment request or refer
                           the beneficiary to DMAHS/HBC by the eighth (8th) day
                           of the month prior to the month in which
                           disenrollment is to become effective.

         C.       HBC Role. All enrollee requests to disenroll must be made
                  through the Health Benefits Coordinator. The contractor may
                  not induce, discuss or accept disenrollments. Any enrollee
                  seeking to disenroll should be directed to contact the HBC.
                  This applies to both mandatory and voluntary enrollees.
                  Disenrollment shall be completed by the HBC at facilities and
                  in a manner so designated by DMAHS.

         D.       Effective Date. The effective date of disenrollment or
                  transfer shall be no later than the first day of the month
                  immediately following the full calendar month the
                  disenrollment is initiated by DMAHS. Notwithstanding anything
                  herein to the contrary, the remittance tape, along with any
                  changes reflected in the weekly register or agreed upon by
                  DMAHS and the contractor in writing, shall serve as official
                  notice to the contractor of disenrollment of an enrollee.

5.10.3   DISENROLLMENT FROM THE CONTRACTOR'S PLAN AT THE CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST

         A.       Criteria for Contractor Disenrollment Request. The contractor
                  may recommend, with written documentation to DMAHS, the
                  disenrollment of an enrollee. In no

                                                                           V-24
<PAGE>
                  event may an enrollee be disenrolled due to health status or
                  need for health services. Enrollees may be disenrolled in any
                  of the following circumstances:

                  1.       The contractor determines that the willful actions of
                           the enrollee are inconsistent with membership in the
                           contractor's plan, and the contractor has made and
                           provides DMAHS with documentation of at least three
                           attempts to reconcile the situation. Examples of
                           inconsistent actions include but are not limited to:
                           persistent refusal to cooperate with any
                           participating provider regarding procedures for
                           consultations or obtaining appointments (this does
                           not preclude an enrollee's right to refuse
                           treatment), intentional misconduct, willful refusal
                           to receive prior approval for non-emergency care;
                           willful refusal to comply with reasonable
                           administrative policies of the contractor, fraud, or
                           making a material misrepresentation to the
                           contractor. In no way can this provision be applied
                           to individuals on the basis of their physical
                           condition, utilization of services, age,
                           socio-economic status or mental disability.

                  2.       The contractor becomes aware that the enrollee falls
                           into an aid category that is not set forth in Article
                           5.2 of this contract, has become ineligible for
                           enrollment pursuant to Article 5.3.1 of this
                           contract, or has moved to a residence outside of the
                           enrollment area covered by this contract.

         B.       Reasonable Efforts Prior to Disenrollment. Prior to
                  recommending disenrollment of an enrollee, the contractor
                  shall make a reasonable effort to identify for the enrollee
                  or, where applicable, an authorized person those actions that
                  have interfered with effective provision of covered medical
                  care and services, and to explain what actions or procedures
                  are acceptable. The contractor must allow the enrollee or,
                  where applicable, an authorized person sufficient opportunity
                  to comply with acceptable procedures prior to recommending
                  disenrollment. The contractor shall provide at least one
                  verbal and at least one written warning to the enrollee
                  regarding the implications of his/her actions.

                  If the enrollee, or, where applicable, an authorized person
                  fails to comply with acceptable procedures, the contractor
                  shall give at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to
                  the enrollee, or, where applicable, an authorized person, of
                  its intent to recommend disenrollment. The notice shall
                  include a written explanation of the reason the contractor
                  intends to request disenrollment, and advise the enrollee or,
                  where applicable, an authorized person of his/her right to
                  file a disenrollment grievance. The contractor shall give
                  DMAHS a copy of the notice and advise DMAHS immediately if the
                  enrollee or, where applicable, an authorized person files a
                  disenrollment grievance.

         C.       Disenrollment Appeals. The contractor shall notify DMAHS of
                  decisions related to all appeals filed by an enrollee or,
                  where applicable, an authorized person as a result of the
                  contractor's notice to an enrollee of its intent to recommend
                  disenrollment. If the enrollee has not filed an appeal or if
                  the contractor

                                                                           V-25
<PAGE>
                  determines that the appeal is unfounded, the contractor may
                  submit to the Office of Managed Health Care of DMAHS a
                  recommendation for disenrollment of the enrollee. The
                  contractor shall notify the enrollee in writing of such
                  request at the time it is filed with DMAHS.

                  DMAHS will decide within ten (10) business days after receipt
                  of the contractor's recommendation whether to disenroll the
                  enrollee and will provide a written determination and
                  notification of the right to a Fair Hearing to the enrollee
                  or, where applicable, an authorized person and the contractor.

         D.       The DMAHS shall review each involuntary disenrollment and may
                  require an in-depth review by State staff, including but not
                  limited to patient and provider interviews, medical record
                  review, and home assessment to determine with the enrollee
                  what plan of action would serve the best interests of the
                  enrollee (and family as applicable.)

5.10.4   TERMINATION

         A.       Enrollees shall be terminated from the contractor's plan
                  whenever:

                  1.       The contract between the contractor and DMAHS is
                           terminated for any reason;

                  2.       The enrollee loses Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare
                           eligibility;

                  3.       Nonpayment of premium for individuals eligible
                           through the NJ FamilyCare Program occurs;

                  4.       DMAHS is notified that the enrollee has moved outside
                           of the enrollment area that the contractor does not
                           service;

                  5.       The enrollee requires more than thirty (30) days of
                           service from a post-acute facility, in which case the
                           contractor shall provide health care services to the
                           enrollee through the last day of the month following
                           the enrollee's admission to the facility.

         B.       For enrollees covered by the contractor's plan who are
                  eligible through the Division of Youth and Family Services and
                  who move to a residence outside of the enrollment area covered
                  by this contract:

                  1.       The DYFS representative will immediately contact the
                           HBC.

                  2.       The HBC will process the enrollee's disenrollment and
                           transfer the enrollee to a new contractor; or
                           disenroll the enrollee to the fee-for-service
                           coverage under DMAHS.

                                                                           V-26
<PAGE>
                  3.       The contractor shall continue to provide services to
                           the enrollee until the enrollee is disenrolled from
                           the contractor's plan.

         C.       Loss of Medicaid or NJ FamilyCare Eligibility. When an
                  enrollee's coverage is terminated due to a loss of Medicaid or
                  NJ FamilyCare eligibility, the contractor shall offer to the
                  enrollee the opportunity to convert the enrollee's membership
                  to a non-group, non-Medicaid enrollment, consistent with
                  conversion privileges offered to other groups enrolled in the
                  contractor.

         D.       In no event shall an enrollee be disenrolled due to health
                  status, need for health services, or pre-existing medical
                  conditions.

                  person, or permit a provider acting on behalf of an enrollee
                  and with the enrollee's consent, to challenge the denials of
                  coverage of services or denials of payment for services. The

                  to translate grievance forms in an enrollee's primary language
                  in order to meet the timeframes of this contract provision. A

                  and procedures to assure that the contractor or any provider
                  or agent of the contractor shall not discriminate against an
                  enrollee or attempt to disenroll an enrollee for filing a
                  complaint or grievance against the contractor.

                  complaint log as well as a grievance tracking and resolution
                  system for Medicaid/ NJ FamilyCare enrollees. The tracking
                  system shall categorize complaints or grievances according to
                  type of issue, standardize a system for routing complaints or
                  grievances to operational department(s) for the dual purpose

                           least five (5) days prior to the activity taking
                           place. The schedules can be submitted in any format,
                           but must include the full name of the marketing
                           representative, the name and full address of the
                           location where marketing is being conducted, the
                           date(s) and beginning and ending times of the
                           activity. All schedules will be reviewed and must

                                                                           V-40

                           be approved in writing by the DMAHS. PLANS MAY NOT
                           COMMENCE ANY MARKETING ACTIVITY WITHOUT PRIOR DMAHS
                           APPROVAL.

         H.       With the exception allowed under Article 5.16.1I, neither the
                  contractor nor its marketing representatives may put into
                  effect a plan under which compensation, reward, gift, or
                  opportunity are offered to eligible enrollees as an inducement
                  to enroll in the contractor's plan other than to offer the
                  health care benefits from the contractor pursuant to this
                  contract. The contractor is prohibited from influencing an
                  individual's enrollment with the contractor in conjunction
                  with the sale of any other insurance.

         I.       The contractor may offer promotional give-aways that shall not
                  exceed a combined total of $10 to any one individual or family
                  for marketing purposes. Giveaways and premiums that have DMAHS
                  approval may be distributed at approved events. These items
                  shall be limited to items that promote good health behavior
                  (e.g., toothbrushes, immunization schedules). For NJ
                  FamilyCare, other promotional items shall be considered with
                  prior approval by DMAHS.

         J.       The contractor shall ensure that marketing representatives are
                  appropriately trained and capable of performing marketing
                  activities in accordance with terms of this contract, N.J.A.C.
                  11:17, 11:2-11, 11:4-17, 8:38-13.2, N.J.S.A. 17:22 A-1,
                  26:2J-16, and the marketing standards described in Article
                  5.16.

         K.       The contractor shall ensure that marketing representatives are
                  versed in and adhere to Medicaid policy regarding beneficiary
                  enrollment and disenrollment as stated in 42 C.F.R. Section
                  434.27. This policy includes, but is not limited to,
                  requirements that enrollees do not experience unreasonable
                  barriers to disenroll, and that the contractor shall not act
                  to discriminate on the basis of adverse health status or
                  greater use or need for health care services.

         L.       Door-to-door canvassing, telephone, telemarketing, or "cold
                  call" marketing of enrollment activities, by the contractor
                  itself or an agent or independent contractor thereof, shall
                  not be permitted. For NJ FamilyCare (Plans B, C, D),
                  telemarketing shall be permitted after review and prior
                  approval by DMAHS of the contractor's marketing plan, scripts
                  and methods to use this approach.

         M.       Contractor employees or agents shall not present themselves
                  unannounced at an enrollee's home for marketing or
                  "educational" purposes. This shall not limit such visits for
                  medical emergencies, urgent medical care, clinical outreach,
                  and health promotion for known enrollees.

         N.       Under no conditions shall a contractor use DMAHS's
                  client/enrollee data base or a provider's patient/customer
                  database to identify and market its plan to Medicaid or NJ
                  FamilyCare beneficiaries. No lists of Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare
                  beneficiary names, addresses, telephone numbers, or
                  Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare numbers of potential Medicaid/NJ
                  FamilyCare enrollees shall be obtained by a contractor

                                                                           V-41
<PAGE>
                  under any circumstances. Neither shall the contractor violate
                  confidentiality by sharing or selling enrollee lists or
                  enrollee/beneficiary data with other persons or organizations
                  for any purpose other than performance of the contractor's
                  obligations pursuant to this contract. For NJ FamilyCare and
                  ABD marketing only, general population lists such as census
                  tracts are permissible for marketing outreach after review and
                  prior approval by DMAHS.

         O.       The contractor shall allow unannounced, on-site monitoring by
                  DMAHS of its enrollment presentations to prospective
                  enrollees, as well as to attend scheduled, periodic meetings
                  between DMAHS and contractor marketing staff to review and
                  discuss presentation content, procedures, and technical
                  issues.

         P.       The contractor shall explain that all health care benefits as
                  specified in Article 4.1 must be obtained through a PCP.

         Q.       The contractor shall periodically review and assess the
                  knowledge and performance of its marketing representatives.

         R.       The contractor shall assure culturally competent presentations
                  by having alternative mechanisms for disseminating information
                  and must receive acknowledgment of the receipt of such
                  information by the beneficiary.

         S.       Individual Medicaid beneficiaries shall be able to contact the
                  contractor for information, and the contractor may respond to
                  such a request.

         T.       Incentives.

                  1.       The contractor may provide an incentive program to
                           its enrollees based on health/educational activities
                           or for compliance with health related
                           recommendations. The incentive program may include,
                           but is not limited to:

                           a.       Health related gift items

                           b.       Gift certificates in exchange for
                                    merchandise

                           Cash or redeemable coupons with a cash value are
                           prohibited.

                  2.       The contractor's incentive program shall be proposed
                           in writing and prior approved by DMAHS.

         U.       Periodic Survey of Enrollees.

                  1.       The contractor shall quarterly survey and report
                           results to DMAHS of new enrollees, in person, by
                           phone, or other means, on a random basis to verify

                                                                           V-42
<PAGE>
                           the enrollees' understanding of the contractor's
                           procedures and services availability.

                  2.       The contractor shall quarterly survey enrollees on
                           reasons for disenrollment who voluntarily
                           disenroll/transfer at time of disenrollment/transfer
                           from contractor's plan.

         V.       All marketing materials, plans and activities shall be prior
                  approved by DMAHS.

5.16.2   STANDARDS FOR MARKETING REPRESENTATIVES

         A.       General Requirements

                  1.       Only a trained marketing representative of the
                           contractor's plan who meets the DHS, DHSS, and DBI
                           requirements shall be permitted to market and to
                           enroll prospective NJ FamilyCare and ABD enrollees.
                           All marketing representatives shall be registered
                           with both the Department of Banking and Insurance
                           (DBI) and the Division of Medical Assistance and
                           Health Services (DMAHS). Delegation of enrollment
                           functions, such as to the office staff of a
                           subcontracting provider of service, shall not be
                           permitted.

                  2.       The contractor shall submit to DMAHS no less
                           frequently than once a month, a listing of the
                           contractor's marketing representatives. Marketing
                           schedules shall be submitted at least five days in
                           advance of marketing activities. Information on each
                           marketing representative shall include the names,
                           three digit Identification Numbers, and marketing
                           locations.

                  3.       All marketing representatives shall wear an
                           identification tag that has been prior approved by
                           DMAHS with a photo identification that must be
                           prominently displayed when the marketing
                           representative is performing marketing activities.
                           The tag shall be at least three inches (3") by five
                           inches (5") and shall display the marketing

                           and a three-digit identification number.

                  4.       In those counties where enrollment is in a voluntary
                           stage, marketing representatives shall not state or
                           imply that enrollment may be made mandatory in the
                           future in an attempt to coerce enrollment.

                  5.       Canvassing shall not be permitted.

                  6.       Outbound telemarketing shall not be permitted. For NJ
                           FamilyCare (Plans B, C, D), telemarketing shall be
                           permitted after review and prior approval by DMAHS of
                           the contractor's marketing plan, script, and methods
                           to use this approach.

                                                                           V-43
<PAGE>
                  7.       Marketing in or around a County Welfare Agency (CWA)
                           office shall not be permitted. The term "in and
                           around the CWA" is defined as being in an area where
                           the marketing representative can be seen from the CWA
                           office and/or where the CWA facility can be seen. The
                           fact that an obstructed view prohibits the marketing
                           activities from being seen shall not mitigate this
                           prohibition.

                  8.       No more than two (2) marketing representatives shall
                           approach a Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare beneficiary at any
                           one time.

                  9.       Marketing representatives shall not encourage clients
                           to disenroll from another contractor's plan or assist
                           an enrollee of another MCE in completing a
                           disenrollment form from the other MCE.

                  10.      Marketing representatives shall ask the prospective
                           enrollee about existing relationships with physicians
                           or other health care providers. The prospective
                           enrollees shall be clearly informed as to whether
                           they will be able to continue to go to those
                           providers as enrollees of the contractor's plan
                           and/or if the Medicaid program will pay for continued
                           services with such providers.

                  11.      Marketing representatives shall secure the signature
                           of new enrollees (head of household) on a statement
                           indicating that an explanation has been provided to
                           them regarding the important points of the
                           contractor's plan and have understood its procedures.
                           A parent or, where applicable, an authorized person,
                           shall enroll minors and ABD beneficiaries, when
                           appropriate, and sign the statement of understanding.
                           However, the contractor may accept an application
                           from pregnant minors and minors living totally on
                           their own who have their own Medicaid ID numbers as
                           head of their own household.

                  12.      Prior to approval of this contract by HCFA, the
                           contractor's staff or agents are prohibited from
                           marketing to, contacting directly or indirectly, or
                           enrolling Medicaid beneficiaries.

                  13.      Marketing representatives shall not state or imply
                           that continuation of Medicaid benefits is contingent
                           upon enrollment in the contractor's plan.

                  14.      Attendance by the contractor's marketing
                           representatives at State-sponsored training sessions
                           is required at the contractor's own expense.

         B.       Commissions/Incentive Payments

                  1.       Commissions/incentive payments may not be based on
                           enrollment numbers alone but shall include other
                           criteria, such as but not limited to,

                                                                           V-44

                           the retention period of enrollees enrolled (at least
                           three (3) months), member satisfaction, and education
                           by the marketing representative.

                           a.       The contractor shall also review
                                    disenrollment information/surveys and all
                                    complaints/grievances specifically
                                    referencing marketing staff.

                  2.       Marketing commissions (including cash, prizes,
                           contests, trips, dinners, and other incentives) shall
                           not exceed thirty (30) percent of the
                           representative's monthly salary.

         C.       Enrollment Inducements

                  1.       The contractor's marketing representatives and other
                           contractor's staff are prohibited from offering or

                           items that promote good health behavior (e.g.,
                           toothbrushes, immunization schedules). However, the
                           combined total of such gifts or gift package shall
                           not exceed an amount of $10 to any one individual or
                           family. Such items:

                  suspension, debarment, disqualification, termination, or other
                  exclusion, the contractor shall immediately act to terminate
                  the provider from participation in this program. Termination
                  for loss of licensure, criminal convictions, or any other
                  reason shall coincide with the effective date of termination
                  of licensure or the Medicaid program's termination effective
                  date whichever is earlier.

                  subcontractors to accept assignment of an enrollee and not
                  discriminate against eligible enrollees because of race,
                  color, creed, religion, ancestry, marital status, sexual
                  orientation, national origin, age, sex, physical or mental

                  of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000d, Section 504 of the
                  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. Section 794, the
                  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C.
                  Section 12131 and rules and regulations promulgated pursuant
                  thereto, or as otherwise provided by law or regulation.

         B.       ADA Compliance. The contractor shall and shall require its
                  providers or subcontractor to comply with the requirements of
                  the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In providing health
                  care benefits, the contractor shall not directly or
                  indirectly, through contractual, licensing, or other
                  arrangements, discriminate against Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare
                  beneficiaries who are qualified disabled individuals covered
                  by the provisions of the ADA (See also Article 4.5.2 for a
                  description of the contractor's ADA compliance plan).

                  A "qualified individual with a disability" defined pursuant to

                  who, with or without reasonable modifications to

                                                                         VII-8
<PAGE>
                  rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural,
                  communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of
                  auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility
                  requirements for the receipt of services or the participation
                  in programs or activities provided by a public entity (42
                  U.S.C. Section 12131).

                  The contractor shall submit to DMAHS a written certification
                  that it is conversant with the requirements of the ADA, that
                  it is in compliance with the law, and that it has assessed its
                  provider network and certifies that the providers meet ADA
                  requirements to the best of the contractor's knowledge. The
                  contractor shall survey its providers of their compliance with
                  the ADA using a standard survey document that will be
                  developed by the State. Survey attestation shall be kept on
                  file by the contractor and shall be available for inspection
                  by the DMAHS. The contractor warrants that it will hold the
                  State harmless and indemnify the State from any liability
                  which may be imposed upon the State as a result of any failure
                  of the contractor to be in compliance with the ADA. Where
                  applicable, the contractor shall abide by the provisions of
                  Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
                  amended, 29 U.S.C. Section 794, regarding access to programs
                  and facilities by people with disabilities.

         C.       The contractor shall and shall require its providers and
                  subcontractors to not discriminate against eligible persons or
                  enrollees on the basis of their health or mental health
                  history, health or mental health status, their need for health
                  care services, amount payable to the contractor on the basis
                  of the eligible person's actuarial class, or pre-existing
                  medical/health conditions.

         D.       The contractor shall and shall require its providers and
                  subcontractors to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42
                  U.S.C. Section 2000d), the regulations (45 C.F.R. Parts 80 &
                  84) pursuant to that Act, and the provisions of Executive
                  Order 11246, Equal Opportunity, dated September 24, 1965, the
                  New Jersey anti-discrimination laws including those contained
                  within N.J.S.A. 10:2-1 through N.J.S.A. 10:2-4, N.J.S.A.
                  10:5-1 et seq. and N.J.S.A. 10:5-38, and all rules and
                  regulations issued thereunder, and any other laws,
                  regulations, or orders which prohibit discrimination on
                  grounds of age, race, ethnicity, mental or physical
                  disability, sexual or affectional orientation or preference,
                  marital status, genetic information, source of payment, sex,
                  color, creed, religion, or national origin or ancestry. The
                  contractor shall not discriminate against any employee engaged
                  in the work required to produce the services covered by this
                  contract, or against any applicant for such employment because
                  of race, creed, color, national origin, age, ancestry, sex,
                  marital status, religion, disability or sexual or affectional
                  orientation or preference.

         E.       The contractor shall not discriminate with respect to
                  participation, reimbursement, or indemnification as to any
                  provider who is acting within the scope of the provider's
                  license or certification under applicable State law, solely on
                  the basis of such license or certification. This paragraph
                  shall not be construed to prohibit an organization from
                  including providers only to the extent necessary to meet the

                                                                         VII-9

                  of compensation, and selection for training, including
                  apprenticeship included in PL 1975, Chapter 127 as attached
                  hereto and made a part hereof.

                  copies of all grievances alleging discrimination against
                  enrollees because of race, color, creed, sex, religion, age,
                  national origin, ancestry, marital status, sexual or
                  affectional orientation, physical or mental handicap for
                  review and appropriate action within three (3) business days
                  of receipt by the contractor.

7.9      INSPECTION RIGHTS

         timeliness of services performed under the contract, and to inspect,
         evaluate, and audit any and all books, records, and facilities
         maintained by the contractor and its providers and subcontractors,
         pertaining to such services, at any time during normal business hours

         hours.

         Access shall be undertaken in such a manner as to not unduly delay the

         right of access herein shall include onsite visits by authorized
         designees of the State.

         The contractor shall also permit the State, at its sole discretion, to
         conduct onsite inspections of facilities maintained by the contractor,
         its providers and subcontractors, prior to approval of their use for
         providing services to enrollees.

                                                                        VII-10

                                                                         VII-11
<PAGE>
         B.       This contract may be extended for successive twelve (12) month
                  periods beyond the original term of the contract whenever the
                  Division supplies the contractor with at least ninety (90)
                  days advance notice of such intent and if a written amendment

                  the premium rate for these enrollees.

                                                                         VII-12

         E.       Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent the
                  Director by amendment to the contract from extending the
                  contract on a month to month basis under the existing rates
                  until such a time that the Director provides revised
                  capitation rates pursuant to Article 7.11.2B.

7.12     TERMINATION

         A.       Change of Circumstances. Where circumstances and/or the needs
                  of the State significantly change or the contract is otherwise
                  deemed by the Director to no longer be in the public interest,
                  the DMAHS may terminate this contract upon no less than thirty
                  (30) days notice to the contractor.

         B.       Emergency Situations. In cases of emergency the Department may
                  shorten the time periods of notification.

         C.       For Cause. DMAHS shall have the right to terminate this
                  contract, without liability to the State, in whole or in part
                  if the contractor:

                  1.       Takes any action or fails to prevent an action that
                           threatens the health, safety or welfare of any
                           enrollee, including significant marketing abuses;

                  2.       Takes any action that threatens the fiscal integrity
                           of the Medicaid program;

                  3.       Has its certification suspended or revoked by DOBI,
                           DHSS, and/or any federal agency or is federally
                           debarred or excluded from federal procurement and
                           non-procurement contracts;

                  4.       Materially breaches this contract or fails to comply
                           with any term or condition of this contract that is
                           not cured within twenty (20) working days of DMAHS'
                           request for compliance;

                  5.       Violates state or federal law;

                  6.       Becomes insolvent; or

                  7.       Brings a proceeding voluntarily, or has a proceeding
                           brought against it involuntarily, under the
                           Bankruptcy Act.

         D.       Notice and Hearing. Except as provided in A and B above, DMAHS
                  shall give the contractor ninety (90) days advance, written
                  notice of termination of this contract, with an opportunity to
                  protest said termination and/or request an informal hearing.
                  This notice shall specify the applicable provisions of this
                  contract and the effective date of termination, which shall
                  not be less than will

                                                                         VII-13
<PAGE>
                  permit an orderly disenrollment of enrollees to the Medicaid
                  fee-for-service program or transfer to another managed care
                  program.

         E.       Contractor's Right to Terminate for Material Breach. The
                  contractor shall have the right to terminate this contract in
                  the event that DMAHS materially breaches this contract or
                  fails to comply with any material term or condition of this
                  contract that is not cured within twenty (20) working days of
                  the contractor's request for compliance. In such event, the
                  contractor shall give DMAHS written notice specifying the
                  reason for and the effective date of the termination, which
                  shall not be less than will permit an orderly disenrollment of
                  enrollees to the Medicaid fee-for-service program or transfer
                  to another managed care program and in no event shall be less
                  than ninety (90) days from the end of the twenty (20) day
                  working day cure period. The effective date of termination is
                  subject to DMAHS concurrence and approval.

         F.       Contractor's Right to Terminate for Act of God. The contractor
                  shall have the right to terminate this contract if the
                  contractor is unable to provide services pursuant to this
                  contract because of a natural disaster and/or an Act of God to
                  such a degree that enrollees cannot obtain reasonable access
                  to services within the contractor's organization, and, after
                  diligent efforts, the contractor cannot make other provisions
                  for the delivery of such services. The contractor shall give
                  DMAHS, within forty-five (45) days after the disaster, written
                  notice of any such termination that specifies:

                  1.       The reasons for the termination, with appropriate
                           documentation of the circumstances arising from a
                           natural disaster or Act of God that precludes
                           reasonable access to services;

                  2.       The contractor's attempts to make other provisions
                           for the delivery of services; and

                  3.       The requested effective date of the termination,
                           which shall not be less time than will permit an
                           orderly disenrollment of enrollees to the Medicaid
                           fee-for-service program or transfer to another
                           managed care program. The effective date of
                           termination is subject to DMAHS concurrence and
                           approval.

         G.       Reduction in Funding. In the event that State and federal
                  funding for the payment of services under this contract is
                  reduced so that payments to the contractor cannot be made in
                  full, this contract shall terminate, without liability to the
                  State, unless both parties agree to a modification of the
                  obligations under this contract. The effective date of such
                  termination shall be ninety (90) days after the contractor
                  receives written notice of the reduction in payment, unless
                  available funds are insufficient to continue payments in full
                  during the ninety (90) day period, in which case the
                  Department shall give the contractor written notice of the
                  earlier date upon which the contract shall terminate.

                                                                         VII-14
<PAGE>
         H.       It is hereby understood and agreed by both parties that this
                  contract shall be effective and payments by DMAHS made to the
                  contractor subject to the availability of State and federal
                  funds. It is further agreed by both parties that this contract
                  can be renegotiated or terminated, without liability to the
                  State in order to comply with state and federal requirements
                  for the purpose of maximizing federal financial participation.

         I.       Upon termination of this contract, the contractor shall comply
                  with the closeout procedures in Article 7.13.

         J.       Rights and Remedies. The rights and remedies of the Department
                  provided in this Article shall not be exclusive and are in
                  addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law or
                  under this contract.

         A.       A closeout period shall begin one hundred-twenty (120) days
                  prior to the last day the contractor is responsible for
                  operating under this contract. During the closeout period, the
                  contractor shall work cooperatively with, and supply program
                  information to, any subsequent contractor and DMAHS. Both the
                  program information and the working relationships between the
                  two contractors shall be defined by DMAHS.

         B.       The contractor shall be responsible for the provision of
                  necessary information and records, whether a part of the MCMIS
                  or compiled and/or stored elsewhere, to the new contractor
                  and/or DMAHS during the closeout period to ensure a smooth
                  transition of responsibility. The new contractor and/or DMAHS
                  shall define the information required during this period and
                  the time frames for submission. Information that shall be
                  required includes but is not limited to:

                  1.       Numbers and status of complaints and grievances in
                           process;

                  2.       Numbers and status of hospital authorizations in

                  3.       Daily hospital logs;

                  4.       Prior authorizations approved and disapproved;

                  5.       Program exceptions approved;

                  6.       Medical cost ratio data;

                  7.       Payment of all outstanding obligations for medical
                           care rendered to enrollees;

                                                                         VII-15
<PAGE>
                  8.       All encounter data required by this contract; and

                  9.       Information on beneficiaries in treatment plans who
                           will require continuity of care consideration.

         C.       All data and information provided by the contractor shall be
                  accompanied by letters, signed by the responsible authority,
                  certifying to the accuracy and completeness of the materials
                  supplied. The contractor shall transmit the information and
                  records required under this Article within the time frames
                  required by the Department. The Department shall have the
                  right, in its sole discretion, to require updates to these
                  data at regular intervals.

         D.       The new contractor shall reimburse any reasonable costs
                  associated with the contractor providing the required
                  information or as mutually agreed upon by the two contractors.
                  The contractor shall not charge more than a cost mutually
                  agreed upon by the contractor and DMAHS or as mutually agreed
                  upon by the two contractors. If program operations are
                  transferred to DMAHS, no such fees shall be charged by the
                  contractor nor paid by DMAHS. Under no circumstances shall a
                  Medicaid beneficiary be billed for any record transfer.

         E.       The contractor shall continue to be responsible for provider
                  and enrollee toll free numbers and after-hours calls until the
                  last day of the closeout period. The new contractor shall bear
                  financial responsibility for costs incurred in modifying the
                  toll free number telephone system. The contractor shall, in
                  good faith, negotiate a contract with the new contractor to
                  coordinate/transfer the toll free number responsibilities, and
                  will provide space at the contractor's current business
                  address including access to necessary records, and information
                  for the new contractor during a due diligence review period.

         F.       Effective two (2) weeks prior to the last day of the closeout
                  period, the contractor shall work cooperatively with the new
                  contractor to process service authorization requests received.
                  The contractor shall be financially responsible for approved
                  requests when the service is provided on or before the last
                  day of the closeout period or if the service is provided
                  through the date of discharge or thirty-one (31) days after
                  the cancellation or termination of this contract for enrollees
                  who remain hospitalized after the last day of the transition
                  period. Disputes between the contractor and the new contractor
                  regarding service authorizations shall be resolved by DMAHS.

         G.       The contractor shall continue to provide all required reports
                  during the closeout period.

         H.       Runout Requirements - General. Runout for this Managed Care
                  Contract shall consist of the processing, payment and monetary
                  reconciliation(s) necessary regarding all enrollees, claims
                  for payment from the contractor's provider

                                                                         VII-16

                  claims generated during the life of the contract.

         J.       Runout Requirements - Items of Concern.

                  1.       Information and documentation that the Department
                           deems necessary under this Article, to effect a
                           smooth Turnover to a successor contractor, shall be
                           required to be submitted on a monthly basis. The
                           Department shall have the right to require updates to
                           this data at regular intervals.

                  2.       Any other information or data, within the parameters
                           of this Managed Care Contract, deemed necessary by
                           the Department to assist in the reprocurement of the
                           contract including where applicable, but not limited
                           to, duplicate copies of x-rays, charting and lab
                           reports, and copies of actual documents and

                           quality of care, and enrollee history shall be
                           provided to DMAHS.

         K.       Runout Requirements - Final Transition. During the final

                           files, and any other pertinent information, including
                           information maintained by any subcontractor or
                           sub-subcontractor, necessary for efficient care
                           management of enrollees, as determined by the
                           Director. Under no circumstances shall a Medicaid
                           enrollee be billed for this service.

                  2.       Enrollee Notification. The terminating and successor
                           contractors shall notify enrollees of the pending
                           transition, with all notices to be submitted to DMAHS

                  shall no longer be responsible for the operation of the
                  program. Obligations of the contractor under this contract
                  that are applicable to the post-operations period will apply
                  whether or not they are enumerated in this Article.

                  1.       The contractor shall maintain local telephone access

                                                                         VII-17

                  2.       The contractor shall be financially responsible for
                           the resolution of beneficiary complaints and
                           grievances timely filed prior to the last day of the
                           post-operations period.

                  3.       The contractor shall have a continuing obligation to
                           provide any required reports during the closeout and
                           post-operations periods.

                  4.       The contractor shall refill prescriptions to cover a
                           minimum of ten (10) days beyond the contract
                           termination date, unless other arrangements are made
                           with the receiving contractor and approved by DMAHS.

                  5.       The contractor shall provide DME for a minimum of the
                           first thirty (30) days of the post-operations period,
                           unless other arrangements are made with the receiving
                           contractor and approved by DMAHS.

                           a.       Customized DME is considered to belong to
                                    the enrollee and stays with the enrollee
                                    when there is a change of contractors.

                           b.       Non-customized DME may be reclaimed by the
                                    contractor when the enrollee no longer
                                    requires the equipment if a system is in
                                    place for refurbishing and reissuing the
                                    equipment. If no such system is in place,
                                    the non-customized DME shall be considered
                                    the property of the enrollee.

                  6.       The contractor shall, within sixty days after the end
                           of the closeout period, account for and return any
                           and all funds advanced by the Department for coverage
                           of enrollees for periods subsequent to the effective
                           date of post-operations.

                  7.       The contractor shall submit to the Department within
                           ninety (90) days after the end of the closeout period
                           an annual report for the period through which
                           services are rendered, and a final financial
                           statement and audit report including at a minimum,
                           revenue and expense statements relating to this
                           contract, and a complete financial statement relating
                           to the overall lines of business of the contractor
                           prepared by a Certified Public Accountant or a
                           licensed public accountant.

         M.       In the event of termination of the contract by DMAHS, such
                  termination shall not affect the obligation of contractor to
                  indemnify DMAHS for any claim by any third party against the
                  State or DMAHS arising from contractor's performance of this
                  contract and for which contractor would otherwise be liable
                  under this contract.

                                                                         VII-18

                                    plan.

                                    transition from the non-surviving
                                    contractor's plan to the acquiring
                                    contractor's plan.

                           f.       Any changes in the benefits/procedures
                                    between the non-surviving contractor's plan
                                    and the acquiring contractor's plan,
                                    including for example, eye care and glasses
                                    benefits, over-the-counter drugs, and

                                    contractor's plan, or switching to another
                                    MCE (for mandatory beneficiaries). The time
                                    frame should incorporate the monthly cutoff
                                    dates established by the DMAHS and the HBC
                                    for the timely and accurate production of
                                    Medicaid identification cards.

                           i.       For voluntary populations, the letter should

                  2.       From the acquiring contractor:

                           a.       If the acquiring contractor wishes to send
                                    welcoming letters, it shall submit for prior
                                    approval to DMAHS, all welcoming letters and
                                    information it will send to the new

                                    prior to the effective date of transfer.

                           b.       The acquiring contractor may not, either
                                    directly or indirectly, contact the
                                    enrollees of the non-surviving contractor,
                                    prior to the enrollees conversion
                                    (approximately ten (10) days prior to the
                                    effective date of transfer).

                  Any returned mail should be re-sent two additional times. If
                  the mail to a beneficiary is returned three times, the name,
                  the Medicaid identification number and last know address
                  should be submitted to the DMAHS for research to determine a
                  more current address.

         D.       Provider Notification. By no later than ninety (90) days prior
                  to the effective date of transfer, the non-surviving

                  will no longer be participating as a result of the
                  merger/acquisition.

         E.       Marketing/Outreach.

                  1.       The acquiring contractor may not make any unsolicited
                           home visits or telephone calls to enrollees of the

                           of coverage under the acquiring contractor's plan.

                  2.       Coincident with the date that enrollee notification
                           letters are sent to those enrollees affected by the
                           merger/acquisition, the non-surviving contractor
                           shall no longer be offered as an option to either new
                           enrollees or to those seeking to transfer from other
                           plans. DMAHS shall approve all enrollee notification
                           letters, and they shall be mailed by the
                           non-surviving contractor. Marketing by the
                           non-surviving contractor shall also cease on that

         F.       Provider Network. The acquiring contractor shall supply the
                  DMAHS and the HBC with an updated provider network fifty (50)

                  formatted in accordance with the procedures set forth in

                  shall be furnished before the enrollee notification letters
                  are to be sent. Such letters shall not be mailed until there
                  is a clear written notification by the DMAHS that the provider
                  network information meets all of the DMAHS

                                                                         VII-21

                  all providers who decline participation with the acquiring
                  contractor and new providers who will participate with the
                  acquiring contractor. The acquiring contractor shall submit
                  weekly updates through the ninety (90) day period following
                  the effective date of transfer.

         G.       Administrative.

                  1.       The non-surviving contractor shall inform DMAHS of
                           the corporate structure it will assume once all
                           enrollees are transitioned to the acquiring
                           contractor. Additionally, an indication of the time
                           frame that this entity will continue to exist shall
                           be provided.

                  2.       The contract of the non-surviving contractor is not
                           terminated until the transaction (acquisition or
                           merger) is approved, enrollees are placed, and all
                           outstanding issues with DOBI, DHSS, and DHS are
                           resolved. Some infrastructure shall exist for up to
                           one year beyond the last date of services to
                           enrollees in order to fulfill remaining contractual
                           requirements.

                  3.       The acquiring contractor and the non-surviving
                           contractor shall maintain their own separate
                           administrative structure and staff until the
                           effective date of transfer.

7.16     LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISIONS

7.16.1   GENERAL PROVISIONS

         It is agreed by the contractor that:

         A.       If contractor does not provide or perform the requirements
                  referred to or listed in this provision, damage to the State
                  may result.

         B.       Proving such damages shall be costly, difficult, and
                  time-consuming.

         C.       Should the State choose to impose liquidated damages, the
                  contractor shall pay the State those damages for not providing
                  or performing the specified requirements; if damages are
                  imposed, collection shall be from the date the State placed
                  the contractor on notice or as may be specified in the written
                  notice.

         D.       Additional damages may occur in specified areas by prolonged
                  periods in which contractor does not provide or perform
                  requirements.

         E.       The damage figures listed below represent a good faith effort
                  to quantify the range of harm that could reasonably be
                  anticipated at the time of the making of the contract.

         F.       The Department may, at its discretion, withhold capitation
                  payments in whole or in part, or offset with advanced notice
                  liquidated damages from capitation payments owed to the
                  contractor.

         G.       The DHS shall have the right to deny payment or recover
                  reimbursement for those services or deliverables which have
                  not been performed and which due to circumstances caused by
                  the contractor cannot be performed or if performed would be of
                  no value to the State. Denial of the amount of payment shall
                  be reasonably related to the amount of work or deliverable
                  lost to the State.

         H.       The DHS shall have the right to recover incorrect payments to
                  the contractor due to omission, error, fraud or abuse, or
                  defalcation by the contractor. Recovery to be made by
                  deduction from subsequent payments under this contract or
                  other contracts between the State and the contractor, or by
                  the State as a debt due to the State or otherwise as provided
                  by law.

         I.       Whenever the State determines that the contractor failed to
                  provide one (1) or more of the medically necessary covered
                  contract services, the State shall have the right to withhold
                  a portion of the contractor's capitation payments for the
                  following month or subsequent months, such portion withheld to
                  be equal to the amount of money the State shall pay to provide
                  such services along with administrative costs of making such
                  payment. Any other harm to the State or the

                                                                         VII-24
<PAGE>
                  beneficiary/enrollee shall be calculated and applied as a
                  damage. The contractor shall be given written notice prior to
                  the withholding of any capitation payment.

         J.       The contractor shall submit a written corrective action plan
                  for any deficiency identified by the Department in writing
                  within five (5) business days from the date of receipt of the
                  Department's notification or within a time determined by the
                  Department depending on the nature of the issue. For each day
                  beyond that time that the Department has not received an
                  acceptable corrective action plan, monetary damages in the
                  amount of one hundred dollars ($100) per day for five (5) days
                  and two hundred fifty ($250) per day thereafter will be
                  deducted from the capitation payment to the contractor. The
                  contractor shall implement the corrective action plan
                  immediately from time of Department notification of the
                  original problem pending approval of the final corrective
                  action plan. The damages shall be applied for failure to
                  implement the corrective action plan from the date of original
                  State notification of the problem. Corrective action plans
                  apply to each of the areas in this Article for potential
                  liquidated damages and the time period allowed shall be at the
                  sole discretion of the DMAHS.

         K.       Self-Reporting of Failures and Noncompliance. Any monetary
                  damages that otherwise would be assessed pursuant to this
                  Article of this contract, may be reduced, at the State's
                  option, if the contractor reports the failure or noncompliance
                  in written detail to DMAHS prior to notice of the
                  noncompliance from the Department. The amount of the reduction
                  shall be no more than ninety (90) percent of the total value
                  of the monetary damages.

         L.       Nothing in this provision shall be construed as relieving the
                  contractor from performing any other contract duty not listed
                  herein, nor is the State's right to enforce or to seek other
                  remedies for failure to perform any other contract duty hereby
                  diminished.

7.16.2   MANAGED CARE OPERATIONS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND PAYMENT PROVISIONS

         During the life of the contract, the contractor shall provide or
         perform each of the requirements as stated in the contract.

         Except as provided for elsewhere in this Article (i.e., the other
         liquidated damages provisions in this Article take precedence), for
         each and every contractor requirement not provided or performed as
         scheduled, or if a requirement is provided or performed inaccurately or
         incompletely, the Department, if it intends to impose liquidated
         damages, shall notify the contractor in writing that the requirement
         was not provided or performed as specified and that liquidated damages
         will be assessed accordingly.

         The contractor shall have fifteen (15) business days from the date of
         such written notice from the Department, or longer if the Department so
         allows, or through a corrective action plan approved by DHS to provide
         or perform the requirement as specified.

                                                                         VII-25
<PAGE>
         Liquidated Damages:

         If the contractor does not provide or perform the requirement within
         fifteen (15) business days of the written notice, or longer if allowed
         by the Department, or through an approved corrective action plan, the
         Department may impose liquidated damages of $250 per requirement per
         day for each day the requirement continues not to be provided or
         performed. If after fifteen (15) additional days from the date the
         Department imposes liquidated damages, the requirement still has not
         been provided or performed, the Department, after written notice to the
         contractor, may increase the liquidated damages to $500 per requirement
         per day for each day the requirement continues to be unprovided or
         unperformed.

7.16.3   TIMELY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

         The contractor shall produce and deliver timely reports within the
         specified timeframes and descriptions in the contract including
         information required by the ERO. Reports shall be produced and
         delivered on both a scheduled and mutually agreed upon on-request basis
         according to the schedule established by DMAHS.

         Liquidated Damages:

         For each late report, the Department shall have the right to impose
         liquidated damages of $250 per day per report until the report is
         provided. For any late report that is not delivered after thirty (30)
         days or such longer period as the Department shall allow, the
         Department, after written notice, shall have the right to increase the
         liquidated damages assessment to $500 per day per report until the
         report is provided.

7.16.4   ACCURATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

         Every report due the State shall contain sufficient and accurate
         information and in the approved media format to fulfill the State's
         purpose for which the report was generated.

         If the Department imposes liquidated damages, it shall give the
         contractor written notice of a report that is either insufficient or
         inaccurate and that liquidated damages will be assessed accordingly.
         After such notice, the contractor shall have fifteen (15) business
         days, or such longer period as the Department may allow, to correct the
         report.

         Encounter data shall be accurate and complete, i.e., have no missing
         encounters or required data elements.

         Liquidated Damages:

         If the contractor fails to correct the report within the fifteen (15)
         business days, or such longer period as the Department may allow, the
         Department shall have the right to impose liquidated damages of $250
         per day per report until the corrected report is

                                                                         VII-26
<PAGE>
         delivered. If the report remains uncorrected for more than thirty (30)
         days from the date liquidated damages are imposed, the Department,
         after written notice, shall have the right to increase the liquidated
         damages assessment to $500 per day per report until the report is
         corrected.

         An amount of $1 may be assessed for each missing or omitted encounter.
         In addition, $1 per encounter or encounter data element may be assessed
         for any pending encounter or error that is not corrected and returned
         to DMAHS within thirty (30) days after notification by DMAHS that the
         data are incomplete or incorrect. The Department shall have the right
         to calculate the total number of missing or omitted encounters and
         encounter data by extrapolating from a sample of missing or omitted
         encounters and encounter data.

7.16.5   TIMELY PAYMENTS TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS

         The contractor shall process claims in accordance with New Jersey laws
         and regulations and shall be subject to damages pursuant to such laws
         and regulations. In addition, pursuant to this contract the Department
         may assess liquidated damages if the contractor does not process (pay
         or deny) claims within the following timeframes: ninety (90) percent of
         all claims (the totality of claims received whether contested or
         uncontested) submitted electronically by medical providers within
         thirty (30) days of receipt; ninety (90) percent of all claims filed
         manually within forty (40) days of receipt; ninety-nine (99) percent of
         all claims, whether submitted electronically or manually, within sixty
         (60) days of receipt; and one hundred (100) percent of all claims
         within ninety (90) days of receipt. Claims processed for providers
         under investigation for fraud or abuse and claims suppressed pursuant
         to Article 8.9 (regarding PIPs) are not subject to these requirements.

         The amount of time required to process a paid claim shall be computed
         in days by comparing the initial date of receipt with the check mailing
         date. The amount of time required to process a denied claim (whether
         all or part of the claim is denied) shall be computed in days by
         comparing the date of initial receipt with the denial notice mailing
         date. Claims processed during the quarter shall be reported in required
         categories through the Claims Lag report (See Section A.7.6 of the
         Appendices (Table 4A and B)). Table 4A shall be used to report claims
         submitted manually and Table 4B shall be used to report claims
         submitted electronically.

         Liquidated Damages:

         Liquidated damages may be assessed if the contractor does not meet the
         above requirements on a quarterly basis. Based on the
         contractor-reported information on the claims lag reports, the
         Department shall determine for each time period (thirty (30)/forty
         (40), sixty (60), and ninety (90) days) the actual percentage of claims
         processed (electronic and manual claims shall be added together). This
         number shall be subtracted from the percentage of claims the contractor
         should have processed in the particular time period. The difference
         shall be expressed in points. For example, if the contractor only
         processed eighty-eight (88) percent of electronic claims within thirty
         (30) days and

                                                                         VII-27
<PAGE>
         eighty-eight (88) percent of manual claims within forty (40) days, it
         shall be considered to be two (2) points short for that time period.
         The points that the contractor is short for each of the three time
         periods shall be added together. This sum shall then be multiplied
         times .0004 times the capitation payments received by the contractor
         during the quarter at issue to arrive at the liquidated damages amount.

         No offset shall be given if a criterion is exceeded. DMAHS reserves the
         right to audit and/or request detail and validation of reported
         information. DMAHS shall have the right to accept or reject the
         contractor's report and may substitute reports created by DMAHS if
         contractor fails to submit reports or the contractor's reports are
         found to be unacceptable.

7.16.6   CONDITIONS FOR TERMINATION OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

         Except as waived by the Contracting Officer, no liquidated damages
         imposed on the contractor shall be terminated or suspended until the
         contractor issues a written notice of correction to the Contracting
         Officer certifying the correction of condition(s) for which liquidated
         damages were imposed and until all contractor corrections have been
         subjected to system testing or other verification at the discretion of
         the Contracting Officer. Liquidated damages shall cease on the day of
         the contractor's certification only if subsequent testing of the
         correction establishes that, indeed, the correction has been made in
         the manner and at the time certified to by the contractor.

         A.       The contractor shall provide the necessary system time to
                  system test any correction the Contracting Officer deems
                  necessary.

         B.       The Contracting Officer shall determine whether the necessary
                  level of documentation has been submitted to verify
                  corrections. The Contracting Officer shall be the sole judge
                  of the sufficiency and accuracy of any documentation.

         C.       System corrections shall be sustained for a reasonable period
                  of at least ninety (90) days from State acceptance; otherwise,
                  liquidated damages may be reimposed without a succeeding grace
                  period within which to correct.

         D.       Contractor use of resources to correct deficiencies shall not
                  be allowed to cause other system problems.

7.16.7   EPSDT & LEAD SCREENING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

         A.       EPSDT Screening

                  1.       The contractor shall ensure that it has achieved an
                           eighty (80) percent participation rate for the twelve
                           (12)-month contract period. "Participation" is
                           defined as one initial or periodicity visit and will
                           be measured using encounter data. If the contractor

                           participation rate by the end of the twelve-month

                                                                         VII-28

                           period, it shall submit a corrective action plan to
                           DMAHS within thirty (30) days of notification by
                           DMAHS of its actual participation rate. DMAHS shall
                           have the right to conduct a follow-up onsite review
                           and/or impose financial damages for non-compliance.

                  a.       Mandatory Sanction. Failure of the contractor to
                           achieve the minimum screening rate shall require the
                           following refund of capitation paid:

                           i.       Achievement of a 50 percent to less than 60
                                    percent EPSDT screening, dental visit and
                                    immunization rate (the lowest measured rate
                                    of each of the components of EPSDT
                                    screening, i.e., periodic exam, immunization
                                    rate, and dental screening rate, shall be
                                    considered to be the rate for EPSDT
                                    participation and the basis for the
                                    sanction): refund of $1 per enrollee for all
                                    enrollees under age 21 not screened.

                           ii.      Achievement of a 40 percent to less than 50
                                    percent EPSDT screening, dental visit, and
                                    immunization rate: refund of $2 per enrollee
                                    for all enrollees under age 21 not screened.

                           iii.     Achievement of a 30 percent to less than 40
                                    percent EPSDT screening, dental visit and
                                    immunization rate: refund of $3 per enrollee
                                    for all enrollees under age 21 not screened.

                           iv.      Achievement of less than 30 percent: refund
                                    of $4 per enrollee for all enrollees under
                                    age 21 not screened.

                  b.       Discretionary Sanction. The DMAHS shall have the
                           right to impose a financial or administrative
                           sanction if the contractor's performance screening
                           rate is between sixty (60) - seventy (70) percent.
                           The DMAHS, in its sole discretion, may impose a
                           sanction after review of the contractor's corrective
                           action plan and ability to demonstrate good faith
                           efforts to improve compliance.

                  2.       Failure to achieve and maintain the required
                           screening rate shall result in the Local Health
                           Departments being permitted to screen the
                           contractor's pediatric members. The cost of these
                           screenings shall be paid by the DMAHS to the LHD, and
                           the screening cost shall be deducted from the
                           contractor's capitation rate in addition to the
                           damages imposed as a result of failure to achieve
                           EPSDT performance standards.

                  3.       Mandatory sanctions may be offset when the contractor
                           demonstrates improved compliance. The Division, in
                           its sole discretion, may reduce the sanction amount
                           by $1 for each twelve (12) point improvement over
                           prior reporting period performance rate. Offsets
                           shall not reduce the financial sanction amount to
                           below $1 per enrollee not screened.

                                                                          VII-29
<PAGE>
         B.       Blood Lead Screening

                  1.       The contractor shall ensure that it has achieved an
                           eighty (80) percent blood lead screening rate of
                           its enrollees under three years of age during a
                           twelve (12)- month contract period. Blood lead
                           screening is described in Article 4 and shall be
                           measured using encounter data. If the contractor
                           has not achieved the eighty (80) percent blood lead
                           screening rate by the end of the twelve (12)-month
                           period, it shall submit a corrective action plan to
                           DMAHS within thirty (30) days of notification by
                           DMAHS of its actual blood lead level screening
                           rate. DMAHS shall have the right to conduct a
                           follow-up onsite review and/or impose financial
                           damages for non-compliance.

                  a.       Mandatory sanction. Failure of the contractor to
                           achieve sixty (60) percent screening rate shall
                           require the following refund of capitation paid:

                           i        Achievement of a 50 percent to less than 60
                                    percent lead screening rate: refund of $2
                                    per enrollee for all enrollees under age 3
                                    not screened.

                           ii       Achievement of a 40 percent to less than 50
                                    percent lead screening rate: refund of $3
                                    per enrollee for all enrollees under age 3
                                    not screened.

                           iii      Achievement of a 30 percent to less than 40
                                    percent lead screening rate: refund of $4
                                    per enrollee for all enrollees under age 3
                                    not screened.

                           iv       Achievement of less than 30 percent lead
                                    screening rate: refund of $5 per enrollee
                                    for all enrollees under age 3 not screened.

                  b.       Discretionary sanction. The DMAHS shall have the
                           right to impose a financial or administrative
                           sanction if the contractor's performance screening
                           rate is between sixty (60) - seventy (70) percent.
                           The DMAHS, in its sole discretion, may impose a
                           sanction after review of the contractor's corrective
                           action plan and ability to demonstrate good faith
                           efforts to improve compliance.

         C.       The contractor must demonstrate continuous quality improvement
                  in achieving the performance standards for EPSDT and lead
                  screenings as stated in Article 4. The Division shall, in its
                  sole discretion, determine the appropriateness of contractor
                  proposed corrective action and the imposition of any other
                  financial or administrative sanctions in addition to those set
                  out above.

                                                                          VII-30

7.16.8.1 FEDERAL STATUTES

         Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(m)(5)(A), the Secretary of the
         Department of Health and Human Services may impose substantial monetary
         and/or criminal penalties on the contractor when the contractor:

         A.       Fails to substantially provide an enrollee with required
                  medically necessary items and services, required under law or
                  under contract to be provided to an enrolled beneficiary, and
                  the failure has adversely affected the enrollee or has
                  substantial likelihood of adversely affecting the enrollees.

         B.       Imposes premiums or charges on enrollees in violation of this
                  contract, which provides that no premiums, deductibles,
                  co-payments or fees of any kind may be charged to Medicaid
                  enrollees.

         C.       Engages in any practice that discriminates among enrollees on
                  the basis of their health status or requirements for health
                  care services by expulsion or refusal to re-enroll an
                  individual or engaging in any practice that would reasonably
                  be expected to have the effect of denying or discouraging
                  enrollment by eligible persons whose medical condition or
                  history indicates a need for substantial future medical
                  services.

         D.       Misrepresents or falsifies information that is furnished to 1)
                  the Secretary, 2) the State, or 3) to any person or entity.

                           each determination above; or,

                           with respect to a determination under Article

<PAGE>
                           with respect to a determination under Article

                           violation of such Article (and the excess amount
                           charged shall be deducted from the penalty and
                           returned to the individual concerned); and the
                           Secretary may seek criminal penalties; and plus,

                           enrolled as a result of a practice described in such
                           Article.

                  2.       Suspension of enrollment of individuals after the
                           date the Secretary notifies the Division of a
                           determination to assess damages as described in
                           Article 7.16.8.2A above, and until the Secretary is
                           satisfied that the basis for such determination has
                           been corrected and is not likely to recur, or

                  3.       Suspension of payment to the contractor for
                           individuals enrolled after the date the Secretary
                           notifies the Division of a determination under
                           Article 7.16.8.2A above and until the Secretary is
                           satisfied that the basis for such determination has
                           been corrected and is not likely to recur.

         B.       The contractor shall be responsible to pay any costs incurred
                  by the State as a result of the Secretary denying payment to
                  the State under 42 U.S.C. Section 1396(m)(5)(B)(ii). The State
                  shall have the right to offset such costs from amounts
                  otherwise due to the contractor.

         C.       Determination by the Division/Secretary regarding the amount
                  of the penalty and assessment for failure to comply with
                  physician incentive plans shall be in accordance with 42
                  C.F.R. Section 1003.106, i.e., the extent to which the failure
                  to provide medically necessary services could be attributed to
                  a prohibited inducement to reduce or limit services under a
                  physician incentive plan and the harm to the enrollee which
                  resulted or could have resulted from such failure. It would be
                  considered an aggravating factor if the contracting
                  organization knowingly or routinely engaged in any prohibited
                  practice which acted as an inducement to reduce or limit
                  medically necessary services provided with respect to a
                  specific enrollee in the contractor's plan.

         have the right to withhold and/or offset any payments otherwise due to
         the contractor pursuant to such sanctions and damages.

                  special State officer or employee in his official capacity in
                  any manner which might tend to impair the objectivity or

7.30     RECORDS RETENTION

         A.       The contractor hereby agrees to maintain an appropriate
                  recordkeeping system (See Section B.4.14 of the Appendices)
                  for services to enrollees and further require its providers
                  and subcontractors to do so. Such system shall collect all
                  pertinent information relating to the medical management of
                  each enrolled beneficiary; and make that information readily
                  available to appropriate health professionals and the
                  Department. Records shall be retained for the later of

                  1.       Five (5) years from the date of service, or

                  2.       Three (3) years after final payment is made under the
                           contract or subcontract and all pending matters are
                           closed.

         B.       If an audit, investigation, litigation, or other action
                  involving the records is started before the end of the
                  retention period, the records shall be retained until all
                  issues arising out of the action are resolved or until the end
                  of the retention period, whichever is later. Records shall be
                  made accessible at a New Jersey site, and on request to
                  agencies of the State of New Jersey and the federal
                  government. For enrollees covered by the contractor's plan who
                  are eligible through the Division of Youth and Family
                  Services, records shall be kept in accordance with the
                  provisions under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10a and 9:6-8:40 and
                  consistent with need to protect the enrollee's
                  confidentiality. All providers and subcontractors shall comply
                  with, and all provider contracts and subcontracts shall
                  contain the requirements stated in this paragraph. (See also
                  Article 7.40, "Confidentiality".)

                                                                          VII-40
<PAGE>
         C.       If contractor's enrollees disenroll from the contractor's
                  plan, the contractor shall require participating providers to
                  release medical records of enrollees as may be directed by the
                  enrollee, authorized representatives of the Department and
                  appropriate agencies of the State of New Jersey and of the
                  federal government. Release of records shall be consistent
                  with the provision of confidentiality expressed in Article
                  7.40 and at no cost to the enrollee.

7.31     WAIVERS

         Nothing in the contract shall be construed to be a waiver by the State
         of any warranty, expressed or implied, except as specifically and
         expressly stated in writing executed by the Director. Further, nothing
         in the contract shall be construed to be a waiver by the State of any
         remedy available to the State under the contract, at law or equity
         except as specifically and expressly stated in writing executed by the
         Director. A waiver by the State of any default or breach shall not
         constitute a waiver of any subsequent default or breach.

7.32     CHANGE BY THE CONTRACTOR

         The contractor shall not make any enhancements, limitations, or changes
         in benefits or benefits coverage; any changes in definition or

         managed care program related to the scope of benefits, allowable
         coverage for those benefits, eligibility of enrollees or providers to
         participate in the program, reimbursement methods and/or schedules to
         providers, or substantial changes to contractor operations without the
         express, written direction or approval of the State. The State shall

         required to effect a change (e.g., to provide additional services).

                  other person, firm, or corporation furnishing or supplying
                  work, services, materials, or supplies in connection with the
                  performance of this contract.

         C.       The contractor agrees further that it shall require under all
                  provider contracts that, in the event the contractor becomes

                  provider, the participating provider shall not seek
                  compensation for services rendered from the State, its

                  capitation payments, and shall not seek payments other than
                  the capitation payments from the State, its officers, agents,
                  and/or employees, and/or the enrollees and/or their eligible
                  dependents for such services, either during or subsequent to
                  the term of the contract.

         E.       The contractor agrees further to indemnify and hold harmless

                  provider's publication, translation, reproduction, delivery,
                  performance, use, or disposition of any data furnished to it
                  under this contract, or for any libelous or otherwise unlawful
                  matter contained in such data that the contractor or any
                  participating provider inserts.

         F.       The contractor shall indemnify the State, its officers, agents
                  and employees, and the enrollees and their eligible dependents
                  from any injury, death, losses, damages, suits, liabilities
                  judgments, costs and expenses and claim of negligence or

                           business days of intent to conduct an investigation
                           or to recover funds, and approval from DMAHS prior to

                           and postpayment edits.

         B.       Distinct Unit. The contractor shall establish a distinct fraud
                  and abuse unit, separate from the contractor's utilization
                  review and quality of care functions. The unit can either be
                  part of the contractor's corporate structure, or operate under
                  contract with the contractor. The unit shall be staffed with
                  individuals with the qualifications and an
                  investigator-to-beneficiary ratio consistent, at a minimum,
                  with the Department of Banking and Insurance requirements for
                  fraud units within health insurance carriers or greater ratio
                  as needed to meet the demands.

         C.       Prepayment Monitoring. The contractor shall conduct prepayment

                                                                          VII-46
<PAGE>
         D.       It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to report in
                  writing to DMAHS' Office of Program Integrity Administration
                  the following:

                  1.       All cases of suspected fraud and abuse, using the
                           format described in Section A.7.2 of the Appendices;

                  2.       Inappropriate or inconsistent practices by providers,
                           subcontractors, enrollees or employees or anyone who
                           can order or refer services, and related parties; and

                  3.       Prepayment monitoring of a provider or a
                           subcontractor by the contractor.

         E.       DMAHS shall have the right to withhold from a contractor's
                  capitation payments an appropriate amount if DMAHS determines
                  that evidence of fraud or abuse exists relating to the
                  contractor, its providers, subcontractors, enrollees,
                  employees, or anyone who can order or refer services, and
                  related parties.

         F.       When DMAHS has withheld payment and/or initiated a recovery
                  action against one of the contractor's providers or
                  subcontractors or a withholding of payments action pursuant to
                  42 C.F.R. Section 455.23, DMAHS may require the contractor to
                  withhold payments to that provider or subcontractor and/or
                  forward those payments to DMAHS.

         G.       DMAHS may direct the contractor to monitor one of its
                  providers or subcontractors, or take such corrective action
                  with respect to that provider or subcontractor as DMAHS deems
                  appropriate, when, in the opinion of DMAHS, good cause exists.

         H.       Sanctions. Failure of the contractor to investigate and
                  correct fraud and abuse problems relating to its enrollees,
                  network providers or subcontractors, and to notify DMAHS
                  timely of same, may result in sanctions. Timely notification
                  is defined as within five (5) business days of identification
                  of the fraud and/or abuse and within twenty (20) business days
                  of the completion of an investigation. For purposes of this
                  subsection, the term "investigation" shall include prepayment
                  monitoring as described above.

                  DMAHS shall have the right to also impose sanctions and/or
                  withhold payments to the contractor (in accordance with
                  provisions of 42 C.F.R. Section 455.23) if it has reliable
                  evidence of fraud or willful misrepresentation relating to the
                  contractor's participation in the New Jersey Medicaid or NJ
                  FamilyCare program or if the contractor fails to initiate its
                  investigation of an identified fraud and/or abuse within one
                  year of identification.

                                                                          VII-47

                  its providers to provide the same level of medical care and
                  health services to DMAHS enrollees as to enrollees in the
                  contractor's plan under private or group contracts unless
                  otherwise required in this contract.

         B.       Enrollees shall be given equitable access, i.e., equal
                  opportunity and consideration for needed services without
                  exclusionary practices of providers or system design because
                  of gender, age, race, ethnicity, color, creed, religion,
                  ancestry, national origin, marital status, sexual or
                  affectional orientation or preference, mental or physical
                  disability, genetic information, or source of payment.

         C.       DMAHS shall assure that all due process safeguards that are
                  otherwise available to Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare beneficiaries
                  remain available to enrollees under this contract.

                  physically secured and safeguarded and shall be limited to
                  those who perform their duties in accordance with provisions

                  or subcontractors, the contractor: (1) shall not use any such
                  information for any purpose other than carrying out the
                  express terms of this contract; (2) shall promptly transmit to

                  contractor maintains any individually identifiable information
                  relating to Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare beneficiaries.

                  shall determine what information is required by law to be
                  released and retain authority over the release of that

                  previously labeled by the contractor as "confidential" or
                  "proprietary," DMAHS shall notify the contractor, who may
                  apply to the Superior Court of New Jersey for a protective
                  order if the contractor opposes the release of information.

         essential part of the contract and that was not a controlling or
         material inducement to enter into the contract, the provision shall
         have no effect and, upon notice by either party, shall be deemed
         stricken from the contract without affecting the binding force of the
         remainder of the contract.

                  3.       The contractor shall demonstrate it has sufficient
                           cash and adequate liquidity set aside (i.e.,
                           restricted) but accessible to the DOBI to meet
                           obligations as they become due, and which are
                           acceptable to DMAHS. The contractor shall comply with
                           DOBI requirements regarding cash

                                                                          VIII-2

                           reserves and where restricted funds will be held (See
                           N.J.A.C. 8:38-11.3, Reserve Requirements).

8.3      INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

         The contractor shall maintain general comprehensive liability
         insurance, products/completed operations insurance, premises/operations
         insurance, unemployment compensation coverage, workmen's compensation
         insurance, reinsurance, and malpractice insurance in such amounts as
         determined necessary in accordance with state and federal statutes and
         regulations, insuring all claims which may arise out of contractor
         operations under the terms of this contract. The DMAHS shall be an
         additional named insured with sixty (60) days prior written notice in
         event of default and/or non-renewal of the policy. Proof of such
         insurance shall be provided to and approved by DMAHS prior to the
         provision of services under this contract and annually thereafter. No
         policy of insurance provided or maintained under this Article shall
         provide for an exclusion for the acts of officers.

8.3.1    INSURANCE CANCELLATION AND/OR CHANGES

         In the event that any carrier of any insurance described in 8.4 or
         8.4.2 exercises cancellation and/or changes, or cancellation or change
         is initiated by the contractor, notice of such cancellation and/or
         change shall be sent immediately to DMAHS for approval. At State's
         option upon cancellation and/or change or lapse of such insurance(s),
         DMAHS may withhold all or part of payments for services under this
         contract until such insurance is reinstated or comparable insurance
         purchased. The contractor is obligated to provide any services during
         the period of such lapse or termination.

8.3.2    STOP-LOSS INSURANCE

         At the discretion of the Departments of Banking and Insurance, Human
         Services, and Health and Senior Services and notwithstanding the
         requirements of N.J.A.C. 8:38-11.5 (b), the contractor may be required
         to obtain, prior to this contract, and maintain "stop-loss" insurance
         from a reinsurance company authorized to do business in New Jersey that
         will cover medical costs that exceed a threshold per case for the
         duration of the contract period. Any coverage other than stipulated
         must be based on an actuarial review, taking into account geographic
         and demographic factors, the nature of the clients, and state solvency
         safeguard requirements.

         All "stop-loss" insurance arrangements, including modifications, shall
         be reviewed and prior approved by the Departments of Banking and
         Insurance, Human Services, and Health and Senior Services. The
         "stop-loss" insurance underwriter must meet the standards of financial
         stability as set forth by the DOBI.

                                                                          VIII-3
<PAGE>
         Contractors with sufficient reserves may choose self-insurance, subject
         to approval by the Department of Human Services and the DOBI where
         appropriate.

8.4      MEDICAL COST RATIO

8.4.1    MEDICAL COST RATIO STANDARD

         The contractor shall maintain direct medical expenditures for enrollees
         equal to or greater than eighty (80) percent of premiums paid in all
         forms from the State. This medical cost ratio (MCR) shall apply to
         annual periods from the contract effective date (if the contract ends
         before the completion of an annual period, the MCR shall apply to that
         shorter period). The MCR shall be based on reports completed by the
         contractor and acceptable to the Department.

         A.       Direct Medical Expenditures. Direct medical expenditures are
                  the incurred costs of providing direct care to enrollees for
                  covered health care services as stated in Article 4.1. Costs
                  related to information and materials for general education and
                  outreach and/or administration are not considered direct
                  medical expenditures.

                  Personnel costs are generally considered to be administrative
                  in nature and must be reported as an administrative expense on
                  Tables 6a and 6b (Statement of Revenues and Expenses) on line
                  30 (Compensation). However, a portion of these costs may
                  qualify as direct medical expenditures, subject to prior
                  review and approval by the State. Those activities that the
                  contractor expects to generate these costs must be specified
                  and detailed in a Medical Cost Ratio - Direct Medical
                  Expenditures Plan which must be reviewed and approved by the
                  State. At the end of the reporting period, the contractor's
                  reporting shall be based only on the approved Medical Cost
                  Ratio - Direct Medical Expenditures Plan. In order to consider
                  these costs as Direct Medical Expenditures, the contractor
                  must complete Table 6c, entitled "Allowable Direct Medical
                  Expenditures," which will be used by the State to determine
                  the allowable portion of costs. The allowable components of
                  these personnel costs include the following activities:

                  1.       Care Management. Allowable direct medical
                           expenditures for care management include: 1)
                           assessment(s) of an enrollee's risk factors; and 2)
                           development of Individual Health Care Plans. The
                           costs of performing these two allowable components
                           may be considered a direct medical expenditure for
                           purposes of calculating MCR.

                  2.       The cost associated with the provision of a
                           face-to-face home visit by the contractor's clinical
                           personnel for the purpose of medical education or
                           anticipatory guidance can be considered a direct
                           medical expenditure.

                  3.       Costs for activities required to achieve compliance
                           standards for EPSDT participation, lead screening,
                           and prenatal care as specified in Article IV may be
                           considered direct medical expenditures. The
                           contractor's reporting shall be

                                                                          VIII-4
<PAGE>
                           based only on the approved Medical Cost Ratio --
                           Direct Medical Expenditures Plan.

         B.       Calculation of MCR. The calculation of MCR will be made using
                  information submitted by each contractor on the quarterly
                  reports - Statement of Revenues and Expenses (Section A.7.8 of
                  the Appendices (Table 6)). The costs related to 8.4.1.A are to
                  be reported on Table 6c and the allowable amount will be added
                  to the calculation of Medical and Hospital Expenses. The sum
                  of all applicable quarters for Total Medical and Hospital
                  Expenses (line 28) less Coordination of Benefits (COB) (line
                  6) and less reinsurance recoveries (line 7) will be divided by
                  the sum of all applicable quarters of Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare
                  premiums (line 4) to arrive at the ratio.

8.4.2    EXEMPTIONS

         An exemption may be granted to reduce the eighty (80) percent MCR
         requirement to no lower than seventy-five (75) percent. Under no
         circumstances will an exemption be granted to a contractor for MCR
         below seventy-five (75) percent. An exemption may be granted if the
         contractor meets all of the following established criteria:

         A.       Has no unresolved quality of care issues;

         B.       Has not received any pending or imposed sanctions;

         C.       Is in compliance with all reporting requirements;

         D.       Had no vacancies in key administrative positions for longer
                  than sixty (60) days;

         E.       Is in compliance with all corrective plans of action relating
                  to Medicaid activity imposed by the Departments of Human
                  Services, Banking and Insurance, or Health and Senior
                  Services;

         F.       Has demonstrated timely processing of claims during the
                  two-year contract period immediately prior to the reporting
                  period and has had no substantiated pattern of complaints from
                  providers for late payments; and

         G.       Has produced evidence to demonstrate compliance with education
                  and outreach provisions of the contract.

8.4.3    DAMAGES

         The Department shall have the right to impose damages on a contractor
         that has failed to maintain an appropriate MCR. The formula for
         imposing damages follows:

                                                                          VIII-5

8.5.10   ABD WITHOUT MEDICARE

         Compensation to the contractor for the ABD without Medicare will be
         risk-adjusted using the Health Based Payments System (HBPS), which is
         described in Article 8.6. Since the HBPS adjusts for regional
         variations, a separate rate for each region is not necessary. In
         addition, the HBPS adjusts for the diagnosis of AIDS; therefore,
         separate AIDS rates are not necessary for this population. Finally, the
         HBPS adjusts for age and sex so separate rates for age and sex within
         this population are not necessary. Accordingly, the base rates to be
         used for this population are as follows:

         A.       ABD without Medicare (non-DDD)

         B.       ABD-DDD without Medicare

8.5.11   ABD WITH MEDICARE

         The capitation rates for the ABD with Medicare population, excluding
         individuals with AIDS and clients of DDD, are in the following premium
         groups:

         A.       Aged

         B.       Blind/Disabled <45

         C.       Blind/Disabled 45+

         These rates are set by region and will not be risk-adjusted using the
         HBPS.

8.5.12   CLIENTS OF DDD

         The contractor shall be paid separate, statewide rates for subgroups of
         the DDD population, excluding individuals with AIDS. These rates
         include MH/SA services for the following premium groups:

         A.       ABD-DDD with Medicare

         B.       AFDC-DDD (includes DYFS, New Jersey Care Pregnant Women, and
                  NJ FamilyCare Plan A)

         These rates will not be risk-adjusted using the HBPS.

8.5.13   PREMIUM GROUPS FOR ENROLLEES WITH AIDS

                                                                          VIII-9
<PAGE>
         A.       In an effort to more appropriately match payment to risk, the
                  contractor shall be paid capitation rates according to the
                  following statewide premium groups for enrollees with AIDS:

                  1.       AFDC-AIDS (includes DYFS, New Jersey Care Pregnant
                           Women, and NJ FamilyCare Plans A (children and
                           parents/caretakers), B, and C individuals, NJ
                           FamilyCare Plan D children)

                  2.       NJ FamilyCare AIDS Plan D parents/caretakers and
                           adults without dependent children under 23 years old
                           and Plan A adults without dependent children under 19
                           years old

                  3.       ABD-AIDS with Medicare

                  4.       ABD-DDD-AIDS with Medicare (includes a MH/SA add on
                           to the ABD-AIDS rate)

                  5.       AFDC-DDD-AIDS (includes a MH/SA add on to the
                           AFDC-AIDS rate) Other eligible groups include DYFS,
                           New Jersey Care Pregnant Women and NJ FamilyCare Plan
                           A (children and parents/caretakers).

                  6.       NJ FamilyCare Plan A adults without dependent
                           children under 19 years old, DDD-AIDS (includes MH/SA
                           add on to the NJ FamilyCare AIDS rate).

         B.       The contractor will be reimbursed double the AIDS rate, once
                  in a member lifetime, in the first month of payment for a
                  recorded diagnosis of AIDS, prospective and newly diagnosed.
                  This is a one-time-only-per-member payment, regardless of MCE.

8.5.14   SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PER PREGNANCY OUTCOME

         Because costs for pregnancy outcomes were not included in the
         capitation rates, the contractor shall be paid supplemental payments
         for pregnancy outcomes for all eligibility categories.

         Payment for pregnancy outcome shall be a single, predetermined lump sum
         payment. This amount shall supplement the existing capitation rate
         paid. The Department will make a supplemental payment to contractors
         following pregnancy outcome. For purposes of this Article, pregnancy
         outcome shall mean each live birth, still birth or miscarriage
         occurring at the thirteenth (13th) or greater week of gestation. This
         supplemental payment shall reimburse the contractor for its inpatient
         hospital, antepartum, and postpartum costs incurred in connection with
         delivery. Costs for care of the baby are not included. Payment shall be
         made by the State to the contractor based on submission of appropriate
         encounter data and use of a special indicator on the claim as specified
         by DMAHS.

                                                                         VIII-10
<PAGE>
8.5.15   PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN BLOOD CLOTTING FACTORS

         The contractor shall be paid separately for factor VIII and IX blood
         clotting factors. Payment will be made by DMAHS to the contractor based
         on: 1) submission of appropriate encounter data; and 2) prior
         notification from the contractor to DMAHS of identification of
         individuals with factor VIII or IX hemophilia. Payment for these
         products will be the lesser of: 1) Average Wholesale Price (AWP) minus
         10% and 2) rates paid by the contractor.

8.5.16   PAYMENT FOR HIV/AIDS DRUGS

         The contractor shall be paid separately for protease inhibitors (First
         Data Bank Specific Therapeutic Class Code W5C) and other
         anti-retroviral agents (First Data Bank Specific Therapeutic Class Code
         W5B) for all eligibility groups with the exception of NJ FamilyCare
         Plan A adults without dependent children under the age of 19 and NJ
         Family Care Plan D parents/caretakers and adults without dependent
         children under the age of 23. Payment for protease inhibitors shall be
         made by DMAHS to the contractor based on: 1) submission of appropriate
         encounter data; and 2) prior notification from the contractor to DMAHS
         of identification of individuals with HIV/AIDS. Payment for these
         products will be the lesser of: 1) Average Wholesale Price (AWP) minus
         10% and 2) rates paid by the contractor.

         Individuals eligible through NJ FamilyCare with a program status code
         of 380 and all children groups shall receive protease inhibitors and
         other anti-retroviral agents under the contractor's plan. All other
         individuals eligible through NJ FamilyCare with program status codes of
         497-498, 300-301, 700-701 and 761-763 shall receive protease inhibitors
         (First Data Bank Specific Therapeutic Class Code W5C) and other
         anti-retrovirals (First Data Bank Specific Therapeutic Class Code W5B)
         through Medicaid fee-for-service and the AIDS Drug Distribution Program
         (ADDP).

8.5.17   EPSDT INCENTIVE PAYMENT

         The contractor shall be paid separately, $10 for every documented
         encounter record for an EPSDT screening examination. The contractor
         shall be required to pass the $10 amount directly to the screening
         provider.

         The incentive payment shall be reimbursed for EPSDT encounter records
         submitted in accordance with 1) procedure codes specified by DMAHS, and
         2) EPSDT periodicity schedule.

                                                                         VIII-11
<PAGE>
8.5.18   ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

         The capitation rates, effective July 1, 2001, recognize costs for
         anticipated contractor administrative expenditures due to Balanced
         Budget Act regulations.

8.6      HEALTH BASED PAYMENT SYSTEM (HBPS) FOR THE ABD WITHOUT MEDICARE
         POPULATION

         A.       The capitation rates for the ABD without Medicare population
                  account for the potential of the contractor receiving a
                  disproportionate number of higher cost beneficiaries. If a
                  traditional age and sex capitation model were used, the rates
                  may not adequately account for the difference in risk assumed
                  by each contractor. In order to account for this problem
                  diagnostic information, as well as age, sex, and
                  regional/geographic information, will be used to adjust the
                  capitation payments. This process is known as health based
                  capitation. By using this additional information, capitation
                  rates can more adequately match the payment with the risk of
                  the enrolled population.

                  In order to incorporate diagnostic information into the
                  analysis, a health-based system categorizes beneficiaries into
                  different diagnostic groups. The Chronic- Disability Payment
                  System (CDPS) grouper will be used to categorize the
                  beneficiaries. This information is then used to create a
                  unique case score for each individual. This individual
                  information is then aggregated to measure the health risk for
                  the contractor.

         B.       The following narrative describes the implementation plan for
                  a health-based capitation model in New Jersey:

                  1.       Develop demographic capitation rates.

                  2.       Develop payment weights for the diagnostic
                           categories. In order to estimate the prospective
                           medical cost for each beneficiary, a payment weight
                           for each diagnostic category is developed. These
                           payment weights identify how much an individual will
                           cost relative to an average beneficiary. For example,
                           an average cost beneficiary will have a case score of
                           1.0, while a higher cost beneficiary - for example, a
                           beneficiary with a high cost pulmonary condition -
                           will have a score of 1.26.

                  3.       Compile a case score for each beneficiary. Using the
                           most recent historical FFS and managed care encounter
                           information, a look-up file will be created that
                           links each eligible beneficiary with a unique case
                           score. In order to develop this unique case score,
                           historical claims information will be run through the
                           CDPS grouper. The output from this process will
                           identify the beneficiaries' diagnostic categories.
                           Using this information and the payment weights
                           estimated in step 2, a case score is then

                                                                         VIII-12
<PAGE>
                           computed for each beneficiary. The following example
                           describes the process for an ABD beneficiary who is
                           not a client of DDD, is a forty-five (45) to
                           sixty-four (64) year old male beneficiary, and lives
                           in Region 3, with a medium-cost central nervous
                           system disorder and a high-cost pulmonary condition:

<TABLE>
<S>          <C>
 .45         Baseline (costs assigned to all beneficiaries - including
               those in no diagnostic group)
 .08         Male 45 - 64
 .78         Medium Cost Central Nervous System Disorder
-.10         Region 3
1.26         High Cost Pulmonary Condition
----
2.47         Total Case Score
</TABLE>

                           In this case, the beneficiary would have projected
                           medical costs 2.47 times the cost of an average
                           beneficiary.

                  4.       Compute case mix values for each contractor and the
                           FFS program. After completing the preceding task, the
                           individual case scores are used to compute an
                           aggregate case mix for each contractor. This is done
                           by matching the individuals in the eligibility file
                           for each contractor with individuals' case scores. In
                           matching the eligibility files, some beneficiaries
                           may have either been eligible for an incomplete time
                           period or have not been eligible during the most
                           recent time period and would not have a computed
                           score. HMO beneficiaries without scores will be
                           assigned the contractor's average case mix. FFS
                           beneficiaries without scores will be assigned the
                           average case mix of 1.0.

                           After matching the eligibility file for the
                           contractor and the FFS program with the individual
                           case scores, an average case mix for the contractor
                           and the FFS program will be calculated. These
                           aggregate case mix values are then normalized to
                           ensure the program will be budget neutral. The
                           following chart describes the normalization process:

<TABLE>

                       average)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

                           By normalizing the case mix scores, the State can
                           ensure the average cost for each beneficiary will not
                           exceed the average prospective cost estimated in step
                           1.

                                                                         VIII-13
<PAGE>
                           In order to determine the payment for the contractor,
                           the case mix rates for the contractor will be
                           multiplied by the base rate calculated in step 1. The
                           case mix rates will be updated periodically, as
                           deemed necessary.

                  5.       Collect and validate contractor encounter data. The
                           following encounter information will be required to
                           develop individual case scores for each enrollee:

                           -        Unique identifier code for each enrollee

                           -        ICD-9 diagnosis code(s) for each encounter

                  6.       Credibility adjustment. There may not be complete
                           confidence in the contractor's relative case mix
                           produced by encounter data. In this case, a
                           credibility rating can be used to blend the
                           contractor's case mix with the State's risk
                           assumption. For example, if the State assigns a
                           contractor a case mix credibility of fifty (50)
                           percent, the following formula is used to develop a
                           case mix rate for the contractor:

                           (.5)*(the contractor's relative case mix) +
                           (.5)*(State's risk adjustment)

                           The credibility factor will be based primarily on the
                           number of beneficiaries enrolled with the contractor.

8.7      THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

         A.       General. The contractor, and by extension its providers and
                  subcontractors, hereby agree to utilize, whenever available,
                  other public or private sources of payment for services
                  rendered to enrollees in the contractor's plan. "Third party",
                  for the purposes of this Article, shall mean any person or
                  entity who is or may be liable to pay for the care and
                  services rendered to a Medicaid beneficiary (See N.J.S.A.
                  30:4D-3m). Examples of a third party include a beneficiary's
                  health insurer, casualty insurer, a managed care organization,
                  Medicare, or an employer-administered ERISA plan. Federal and
                  State law requires that Medicaid payments be last dollar
                  coverage and should be utilized only after all other sources
                  of third party liability (TPL) are exhausted, subject to the
                  exceptions in Section F below.

         B.       Third Party Coverage Unknown. If coverage through health or
                  casualty insurance is not known or is unavailable at the time
                  the claim is filed, then the claim must be paid and
                  postpayment recovery must be initiated within six months from
                  the date of service.

         C.       Capitation Rates. The State has taken into account historical
                  and/or anticipated cost avoidance and recovery due to the
                  existence of liable third parties in setting

                                                                         VIII-14
<PAGE>
                  capitation rates and determining the payment amounts. These
                  factors do not include any reductions due to tort recoveries,
                  or to recoveries made by the State from the estates of
                  deceased Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, future rates may
                  be based upon the contractor's actual or expected performance
                  involving TPL. Consequently, it is in the interests of both
                  the State and the contractor for the contractor to maximize
                  its revenue by fully exhausting all sources of available third
                  party coverage.

         D.       Categories. Third party resources are categorized as 1) health
                  insurance, 2) casualty insurance, 3) legal causes of action
                  for damages, and 4) estate recoveries.

                  1.       Health Insurance. The contractor shall pursue and
                           collect payments from health insurers when health
                           insurance coverage is available, unless prior
                           approval to take other action is obtained from the
                           State. "Health insurance" shall include, but not be
                           limited to, coverage by any health care insurer, HMO,
                           Medicare, or an employer-administered ERISA plan.
                           Funds so collected shall be retained by the
                           contractor. In pursuing such recoveries, the
                           contractor may utilize the State's assignment and
                           subrogation authority to the extent permitted by
                           State law.

                           a.       The State shall have the right to pursue,
                                    collect, and retain payments from liable
                                    health insurers if the contractor has failed
                                    to initiate collection from the health
                                    insurer within six (6) months from the date
                                    of service. The contractor shall cooperate
                                    with the State in all such collection
                                    efforts, and shall also direct its providers
                                    to do so.

                  2.       Casualty Insurance. The contractor shall pursue and
                           collect payment from casualty insurance available to
                           the enrollee, unless prior approval to take other
                           action is obtained from the State. "Casualty
                           insurance" shall include, but not be limited to, no
                           fault auto insurance benefits, worker's compensation
                           benefits, and medical payments coverage through a
                           homeowner's insurance policy. Funds so collected
                           shall be retained by the contractor. In pursuing such
                           recoveries, the contractor may utilize the State's
                           assignment and subrogation authority to the extent
                           permitted by State law.

                           a.       The State shall have the right to pursue,
                                    collect, and retain casualty insurance
                                    payments where the contractor has failed to
                                    initiate collection within six (6) months
                                    from the date of service.

                  3.       Legal Causes of Action for Damages. The State shall
                           have the sole and exclusive right to pursue and
                           collect payments made by the contractor when a legal
                           cause of action for damages is instituted on behalf
                           of a Medicaid enrollee against a third party or when
                           the State receives notice that legal counsel has been
                           retained by or on behalf of any enrollee. The

                                                                         VIII-15
<PAGE>
                           contractor shall cooperate with the State in all
                           collection efforts, and shall also direct its
                           providers to do so. State collections identified as
                           contractor-related resulting from such legal actions
                           will be retained by the State.

                  4.       Estate Recoveries. The State shall have the sole and
                           exclusive right to pursue and recover correctly paid
                           benefits from the estate of a deceased Medicaid
                           enrollee in accordance with federal and State law.
                           Such recoveries will be retained by the State.

         E.       Cost Avoidance.

                  1.       When the contractor is aware of health or casualty
                           insurance coverage prior to paying for a health care
                           service, it shall avoid payment by rejecting a
                           provider's claim and directing that the claim be
                           submitted first to the appropriate third party, or by
                           directing its provider to withhold payments to a
                           subcontractor.

                  2.       If insurance coverage is not available, or if one of
                           the exceptions to the cost avoidance rule discussed
                           below applies, then payment must be made and a claim
                           made against the third party, if it is determined
                           that the third party is or may be liable.

         F.       Exceptions to the Cost Avoidance Rule.

                  1.       In the following situations, the contractor must
                           first pay its providers and then coordinate with the
                           liable third party, unless prior approval to take
                           other action is obtained from the State.

                           a.       The coverage is derived from a parent whose
                                    obligation to pay support is being enforced
                                    by the Department of Human Services.

                           b.       The claim is for prenatal care for a
                                    pregnant woman or for preventive pediatric
                                    services (including EPSDT services) that are
                                    covered by the Medicaid program.

                           c.       The claim is for labor, delivery, and
                                    post-partum care and does not involve
                                    hospital costs associated with the inpatient
                                    hospital stay.

                           d.       The claim is for a child who is in a DYFS
                                    supported out of home placement.

                           e.       The claim involves coverage or services
                                    mentioned in 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, or 1.d, above in
                                    combination with another service.

                  2.       If the contractor knows that the third party will
                           neither pay for nor provide the covered service, and
                           the service is medically necessary, the contractor

                                                                         VIII-16
<PAGE>
                           shall neither deny payment for the service nor
                           require a written denial from the third party.

                  3.       If the contractor does not know whether a particular
                           service is covered by the third party, and the
                           service is medically necessary, the contractor shall
                           contact the third party and determine whether or not
                           such service is covered rather than requiring the
                           enrollee to do so. Further, the contractor shall
                           require the provider or subcontractor to bill the
                           third party if coverage is available.

                  4.       Postpayment recovery rather than cost avoidance is
                           necessary in cases where the contractor was not aware
                           of third party coverage at the time that services
                           were rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost
                           avoid, in accordance with the provisions of this
                           Article as applicable. Under these circumstances, the
                           contractor shall identify all potentially liable
                           third parties and pursue reimbursement from them,
                           unless prior approval to take other action is
                           obtained from the State. In pursuing such recoveries,
                           the contractor may utilize the State's assignment and
                           subrogation authority to the extent permitted by
                           State law. This provision shall not apply in the case
                           of any tort matter but rather the provisions of
                           Article 8.7D.3 shall be applicable.

         G.       Sharing of TPL Information by the State.

                  1.       By the fifteenth (15th) day of every month, the State
                           may provide the contractor with a list of all known
                           health insurance coverage information for the purpose
                           of updating the contractor's files.

                  2.       Additionally, the State may provide a quarterly
                           health insurer file to the contractor that will
                           contain all of the health insurers that the State has
                           on file and related information that is needed in
                           order to file TPL claims.

         H.       Sharing of TPL Information by the Contractor.

                  1.       The contractor shall notify the State within thirty
                           (30) days after it learns that an enrollee has health
                           insurance coverage not reflected in the State's
                           health insurance coverage file, or casualty insurance
                           coverage, or of any change in an enrollee's health
                           insurance coverage. (See Section A.8.1 of the
                           Appendices.) The contractor shall impose a
                           corresponding requirement upon its servicing
                           providers to notify it of any newly discovered
                           coverage, or of any changes in an enrollee's health
                           insurance coverage.

                  2.       When the contractor becomes aware that an enrollee
                           has retained counsel, who either may institute or has
                           instituted a legal cause of action for damages
                           against a third party, the contractor shall notify
                           the State in

                                                                         VIII-17
<PAGE>
                           writing, including the enrollee's name and Medicaid
                           identification number, date of accident/incident,
                           nature of injury, name and address of enrollee's
                           legal representative, copies of pleadings, and any
                           other documents related to the action in the
                           contractor's possession or control. This shall
                           include, but not be limited to (for each service date
                           on or subsequent to the date of the
                           accident/incident), the name of the provider,
                           practitioner or subcontractor, the enrollee's
                           diagnosis, the nature of the service provided to the
                           enrollee, and the amount paid to the provider (or to
                           a provider's authorized subcontractor) by the
                           contractor for each service. A form is available for
                           this purpose and is included in Section A.8.2 of the
                           Appendices.

                  3.       The contractor shall notify the State within thirty
                           (30) days of the date it becomes aware of the death
                           of one of its Medicaid enrollees age fifty-five (55)
                           or older, giving the enrollee's full name, Social
                           Security Number, Medicaid identification number, and
                           date of death. The State will then determine whether
                           it can recover correctly paid Medicaid benefits from
                           the enrollee's estate.

                  4.       The contractor agrees to cooperate with the State's
                           efforts to maximize the collection of third party
                           payments by providing to the State updates to the
                           information required by this Article.

         I.       Enrollment Exclusions and Contractor Liability for the Costs
                  of Care.

                  1.       Any Medicaid beneficiary enrolled in or covered by
                           either a Medicare or commercial HMO will not be
                           enrolled by the contractor. The only exception to
                           this exclusion from enrollment is when the contractor
                           and the beneficiary's Medicare/commercial HMO are the
                           same. When beneficiaries are enrolled under this
                           exception, appropriate reductions will be made in the
                           State's capitation payments to the contractor.

                  2.       If the contractor and the Medicaid beneficiary's
                           Medicare or commercial HMO are the same, the
                           contractor will be responsible for either:

                           a.       Paying all cost-sharing expenses of the
                                    Medicaid beneficiary; or

                           b.       Addressing cost sharing in the contracts
                                    with its providers in such a way that the
                                    Medicaid beneficiary is not liable for any
                                    cost-sharing expenses, subject to
                                    subarticle 3 below.

                  3.       If a Medicaid beneficiary otherwise covered by the
                           provisions of subarticle 2 above wishes to utilize a
                           provider outside of the Medicare or commercial HMO's
                           network, the HMO's rules apply. Failure to follow the
                           HMO's rules relieves both the contractor and the
                           State of any liability

                                                                         VIII-18
<PAGE>
                           for the cost of the care and services rendered to the
                           beneficiary, subject to subarticle 4 below.

                  4.       The only exception to subarticle 3 above is if the
                           HMO's rules cannot be followed solely because
                           emergency services were provided by a non-
                           participating provider, practitioner, or
                           subcontractor because the services were immediately
                           required due to sudden or unexpected onset of a
                           medical condition. In this circumstance, the
                           contractor remains responsible for the cost of the
                           care and services rendered to the beneficiary.

                  5.       If a Medicaid beneficiary enrolled with the
                           contractor is also enrolled in or covered by a health
                           or casualty insurer other than a Medicare or
                           commercial HMO, the contractor is fully responsible
                           for coordinating benefits so as to maximize the
                           utilization of third party coverage in accordance
                           with the provisions of this Article. The contractor
                           shall be responsible for payment of the enrollee's
                           coinsurance, deductibles, copayments, and other
                           cost-sharing expenses, but the contractor's total
                           liability shall not exceed what it would have paid in
                           the absence of TPL. The contractor shall coordinate
                           benefits and payments with the health or casualty
                           insurer for services authorized by the contractor,
                           but provided outside the contractor's plan. The
                           contractor remains responsible for the costs incurred
                           by the beneficiary with respect to care and services
                           which are included in the contractor's capitation
                           rate, but which are not covered or payable under the
                           health or casualty insurer's plan.

                  6.       The State will continue to pay Medicare Part A and
                           Part B premiums for Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles
                           and Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries.

                  7.       Any references to Medicare coverage in this Article
                           shall apply to both Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles
                           and Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries.

         J.       Other Protections for Medicaid Enrollees.

                  1.       The contractor shall not impose, or allow its
                           participating providers or subcontractors to impose,
                           cost-sharing charges of any kind upon Medicaid
                           beneficiaries enrolled in the contractor's plan
                           pursuant to this contract. This Article does not
                           apply to individuals eligible solely through the NJ
                           FamilyCare Program Plan C or D, for whom providers
                           will be required to collect cost-sharing for certain
                           services.

                  2.       The contractor's obligations under this Article shall
                           not be imposed upon the enrollees, although the
                           contractor shall require enrollees to cooperate in
                           the identification of any and all other potential
                           sources of payment for services. Instances of
                           non-cooperation shall be referred to the State.

                                                                         VIII-19
<PAGE>
                  3.       The contractor shall neither encourage nor require a
                           Medicaid enrollee to reduce or terminate TPL
                           coverage.

                  4.       Unless otherwise permitted or required by federal and
                           State law, health care services cannot be denied to a
                           Medicaid enrollee because of a third party's
                           potential liability to pay for the services, and the
                           contractor shall ensure that its cost avoidance
                           efforts do not prevent an enrollee from receiving
                           medically necessary services.

8.8      COMPENSATION/CAPITATION CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS

         A.       Contractor Compensation. Compensation to the contractor shall
                  consist of monthly capitation payments, supplemental payments
                  per pregnancy outcome/delivery, certain blood products for
                  hemophilia factors VIII & IX disorders, and payment for
                  certain HIV/AIDS drugs. Contractors must agree to enroll all
                  non-exempt Aged, Blind and Disabled and NJ FamilyCare
                  beneficiaries to qualify to serve AFDC/TANF beneficiaries.

         B.       Capitation Payment Schedule. DMAHS hereby agrees to pay the
                  capitation by the fifteenth (15th) day of any month during
                  which health care services will be available to an enrollee;
                  provided that information pertaining to enrollment and
                  eligibility, which is necessary to determine the amount of
                  said payment, is received by DMAHS within the time limitation
                  contained in Article 5 of this contract.

         C.       Upper Payment Limit and Cost-Effectiveness. The contractor
                  shall receive monthly capitation payments, for a defined scope
                  of services to be furnished to a defined number of enrollees,
                  for providing the services contained in the Benefits Package
                  described in Article 4.1 of this contract. Such payments will
                  not exceed the upper payment limit, established by DMAHS,
                  pursuant to 42 C.F.R. Part 447, which is the cost of providing
                  those services on a fee-for-service basis to an actuarially
                  equivalent, non-enrolled population group. The contractor is
                  not entitled to receive payments that exceed the upper payment
                  limit. In addition, the contractor is not entitled to payments
                  that would cause the State to exceed the cost-effectiveness
                  established in its 1915(b) waiver.

         D.       Adjustments and Renegotiation of Capitation Rates. Capitation
                  rates are prospective in nature and will not be adjusted
                  retroactively or subject to renegotiation during the contract
                  period except as explicitly noted in the contract. Capitation
                  rates will be paid only for eligible beneficiaries enrolled
                  during the period for which the adjusted capitation payments
                  are being made. Payments provided for under the contract will
                  be denied for new enrollees when, and for so long as, payments
                  for those enrollees is denied by HCFA under 42 C.F.R.
                  434.67(e).

                                                                         VIII-20
<PAGE>
         E.       Payment by State Fiscal Agent. The State fiscal agent will
                  make payments to the contractor.

         F.       Payment in Full. The monthly capitation payments plus
                  supplemental payments for pregnancy outcomes and payment for
                  certain HIV/AIDS drugs and blood clotting factors VIII and IX
                  to the contractor shall constitute full and complete payment
                  to the contractor and full discharge of any and all
                  responsibility by the Division for the costs of all services
                  that the contractor provides pursuant to this contract.

         G.       Payments to Providers. Payments shall not be made on behalf of
                  an enrollee to providers of health care services other than
                  the contractor for the benefits covered in Article Four and
                  rendered during the term of this contract.

         H.       Time Period for Capitation Payment per Enrollee. The monthly
                  capitation payment per enrollee is due to the contractor from
                  the effective date of an enrollee's enrollment until the
                  effective date of termination of enrollment or termination of
                  this contract, whichever occurs first.

         I.       Payment If Enrollment Begins after First Day of Month. When
                  DMAHS' capitation payment obligation is computed, if an
                  enrollee's coverage begins after the first day of a month,
                  DMAHS will pay the contractor a fractional capitation payment
                  that is proportionate to the part of the month during which
                  the contractor provides coverage. Payments are calculated and
                  made to the last day of a calendar month except as noted in
                  this Article.

         J.       Risk Assumption. The capitation rates shall not include any
                  amount for recoupment of any losses suffered by the contractor
                  for risks assumed under this contract or any prior contract
                  with the Department.

         K.       Hospitalizations. For any eligible person who applies for
                  participation in the contractor's plan, but who is
                  hospitalized prior to the time coverage under the plan becomes
                  effective, such coverage shall not commence until the date
                  after such person is discharged from the hospital and DMAHS
                  shall be liable for payment for the hospitalization, including
                  any charges for readmission within forty-eight (48) hours of
                  discharge for the same diagnosis. If an enrollee's
                  disenrollment or termination becomes effective during a
                  hospitalization, the contractor shall be liable for
                  hospitalization until the date such person is discharged from
                  the hospital, including any charges for readmission within
                  forty-eight (48) hours of discharge for the same diagnosis.
                  The contractor must notify DMAHS of these occurrences to
                  facilitate payment to appropriate providers.

         L.       Continuation of Benefits. The contractor shall continue
                  benefits for all enrollees for the duration of the contract
                  period for which capitation payments have been made, including
                  enrollees in an inpatient facility until discharge. The
                  contractor shall notify DMAHS of these occurrences.

                                                                         VIII-21
<PAGE>
8.9      CONTRACTOR ADVANCED PAYMENTS AND PIPS TO PROVIDERS

                  A.       The contractor shall make advance payments to its
                           providers, capitation, FFS, or other financial
                           reimbursement arrangement, based on a provider's
                           historical billing or utilization of services if the
                           contractor's claims processing systems become
                           inoperational or experience any difficulty in making
                           timely payments. Under no circumstances shall the
                           contractor default on the claims payment timeliness
                           provisions of this contract. Advance payments shall
                           also be made when compliance with claims payment
                           timeliness is less than ninety (90) percent for two
                           (2) quarters. Such advance payments will continue
                           until the contractor is in full compliance with
                           timely payment provisions for two (2) successive
                           quarters.

                  B.       Periodic Interim Payments (PIPs) to Hospitals. The
                           contractor shall provide periodic interim payments to
                           participating, PIP-qualifying hospitals.

                           1.       Designation of PIP-Qualifying Hospitals.
                                    Each quarter, DMAHS shall determine which
                                    hospitals qualify for monthly PIPs.

                                                                         VIII-22
<PAGE>
                           2.       When Contractor is Required to Make PIPs.
                                    The contractor shall make PIPs to a
                                    participating (network provider), qualifying
                                    hospital when the average monthly payment
                                    from the contractor to the hospital is at
                                    least $100,000 for the most recent six-month
                                    period excluding outliers. An outlier is
                                    defined as a single admission for which the
                                    payment to the hospital exceeds $100,000. It
                                    should be noted that outlier claims paid are
                                    included in the establishment of the monthly
                                    PIPs and the reconciliation of the PIPs.

                           3.       Methodologies to Establish Amount of PIPs.

                                    a.       The contractor may work out a
                                             mutually agreeable arrangement with
                                             the participating PIP-qualifying
                                             hospitals for developing a
                                             methodology for determining the
                                             amount of the PIPs and reconciling
                                             the PIP advances to paid claims. If
                                             a mutually agreeable arrangement
                                             cannot be reached, the contractor
                                             shall make PIPs in accordance with
                                             the methodology described in 3.b.
                                             below.

                                    b.       Beginning August 1, 2000, the
                                             contractor shall provide a
                                             participating, PIP-qualifying
                                             hospital with an initial 60-day PIP
                                             (representing two 30-day cash
                                             advances) which shall be reconciled
                                             using a claims offset process, with
                                             the first 30-day PIP reconciled to
                                             claims adjudicated during the first
                                             month following the initial PIP
                                             (August), and the second 30-day PIP
                                             reconciled to claims adjudicated
                                             during the second month following
                                             the initial PIP (September). In
                                             September 2000 and all subsequent
                                             months, the hospital shall receive
                                             a 30-day PIP which shall be offset
                                             against claims adjudicated at the
                                             end of the following month. At
                                             reconciliation, any excess claims
                                             adjudicated above the PIP amount
                                             shall result in an additional
                                             payment to the hospital equal to
                                             the value of any excess claims
                                             above the PIP. If the value of
                                             claims adjudicated is less than the
                                             PIP, the shortage shall be offset
                                             against the next PIP made to the
                                             hospital. An example of how this
                                             methodology shall work is as
                                             follows:

                                                                         VIII-23

8.10     FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS

         A.       Standards for Contractor FQHC Rates. The contractor shall not
                  reimburse FQHCs less than the level and amount of payment
                  which the contractor would make for a similar set of services
                  if the services were furnished by a non-FQHC. The contractor
                  may pay the FQHCs on a fee-for-service or capitated basis. The
                  contractor shall make payments for primary care equal to, or
                  greater than, the average amounts paid to other primary care
                  providers. Non-primary care services may be included if
                  mutually agreeable between the contractor and FQHC. For
                  non-primary care services, payments shall be equal to, or
                  greater than, the average amounts paid to other non-primary
                  care providers for equivalent services.

         B.       DMAHS Reimbursement to FQHCs. Under Title XIX, an FQHC shall
                  be paid reasonable cost reimbursement by DMAHS. At the end of
                  each fiscal year the contractor and the FQHC will complete
                  certain reporting requirements specified that will enable
                  DMAHS to determine reasonable costs and compare that to what
                  was actually paid by the contractor to the FQHC. DMAHS will
                  reimburse the FQHC for the difference (i.e., difference
                  between the determined reasonable cost per encounter and the
                  payments to the FQHC made by the contractor and DMAHS) if the
                  payments by the contractor to the FQHC are less than
                  reasonable costs. DMAHS will recoup payments from the FQHC in
                  excess of reasonable costs. FQHC providers must meet the
                  contractor's credentialing and program requirements.

         C.       Contractor Participation in Reconciliation Process. The
                  contractor shall participate in the reconciliation processes
                  if there is a dispute between what the contractor reported
                  (See Section A.7.20 of the Appendices (Table 18)) and what the
                  FQHC reported as valid encounters or payments. This
                  participation may include appearances in the Office of
                  Administrative Law, as well as meeting with DMAHS staff.

                                                                         VIII-24
