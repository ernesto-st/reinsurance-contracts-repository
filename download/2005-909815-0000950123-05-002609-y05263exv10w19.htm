4.&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Any Credit established hereunder may, if
requested by us on the application form relating thereto and
subject to your consent, bear a clause to the effect that it
will automatically be extended for successive periods of one
year (or such other period as may be stated in the relevant
application form) unless the beneficiary has received from the
bank or institution issuing the Credit (&#147;the Issuing
Bank&#148;) by registered mail (or other appropriate receipted
delivery) notification of intention not to renew such Credit at
least 30&nbsp;days (or such other period as may be stated in the
relevant application form) (&#147;the notice period&#148;) prior
to the end of the original term or, as the case may be, of a
period of extension. The Issuing Bank shall be under no
obligation to us to send the beneficiary such notification (and
without such notification to the beneficiary the Credit will be
automatically extended as provided above) unless you shall have
received at your branch at 336 Strand, London, WC2R 1HB (or such
other branch in England as may be advised to us by you for such
purpose) by registered mail or other means acceptable to you
notification from us (or from any one or more of the other
parties (if any) for whose account(s) such Credit may also have
been established as contemplated by paragraph&nbsp;2 above) of
our or its election not to renew such Credit at least
30&nbsp;days prior to the commencement of the notice period
relating to the original term or, as the case may be, a period
of extension; provided however that you will, as soon as is
reasonably possible, give us advice of the receipt by you of any

such notice from any other such parties. We understand that
receipt by you of any such notice may result in the whole of
such Credit being cancelled (and not just the portion
attributable to us in the case of a joint credit as referred to
in paragraph&nbsp;2 above) and, save as is provided above, you
reserve the right, at your sole option and discretion, to give
or procure the giving at any time to the beneficiary of
notification of intention not to renew any Credit and that if
you exercise such said right you will give us notice in writing
thereof as soon as is reasonably possible.

(b)&nbsp;If, in either of the circumstances referred to in
sub-paragraph&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;above, the Issuing Bank has given
notification not to renew such Credit, then you may (but shall
not be obliged to) without further authority from us (or from
any of the other persons as aforesaid) arrange for the
beneficiary to accept (1)&nbsp;a substitute Credit (&#147;the
Substitute Credit&#148;) from the Issuing Bank on terms
identical to such Credit except that (i)&nbsp;the amount of the
Substitute Credit will be equal to the then undrawn face value
of such Credit less the portion thereof (determined by you ) to
be attributable to the person (s)&nbsp;(&#147;the excluded
Person(s)&#148;) who gave a notice of non-renewal to you or, as
the case may be, for whom you do not wish to arrange the
issuance of the Substitute Credit and (ii)&nbsp;the original
term of the Substitute Credit will, subject to renewal as
mentioned in sub-paragraph&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;above, be up to one
year in duration (or such longer duration as may be required by
any regulatory or other authority having jurisdiction as to the
acceptability of the Substitute Credit) OR (2)&nbsp;such other
arrangement, compromise, release or waiver as, in your sole
opinion, will result in the same effect being achieved as in
(1)&nbsp;above. You will, as soon as reasonably possible, advise
us (unless we are the or one of the Excluded Person(s)) of the
matter(s) effected by you pursuant to the foregoing provisions.

5.&nbsp;You may, at your sole option, arrange for the issuance
of any Credit as being subject to the Uniform Customs and
Practice for Documentary Credits (1983 Revision) ICC Publication
No.&nbsp;400 or any earlier or more recent revision thereof from
time to time; <I>provided however </I>that you may agree such
modifications thereof as may be required by any regulatory or

Scheme&#148;) established by Citibank, N.A. on our behalf in
favour of United States or other beneficiaries shall, excepting
details of the beneficiary, amount and tenor, on acceptance by

8.&nbsp;We further understand that Citibank, N.A. also reserves
the right to issue any Credit through any third party
correspondent of its choice and, in such circumstances,
Citibank, N.A. will be required to guarantee reimbursement to
such correspondent of any payments which such correspondent may
make under the Credit in question and such guarantee (howsoever
described) shall also be treated mutatis mutandis as a Credit
for the purpose of this Agreement.

9.&nbsp;The provisions of the foregoing paragraphs shall be
equally applicable to any increase, extension, renewal, partial
renewal, modification or amendment of or substitute instrument
for any Credit to which they apply. If for any reason any amount
paid under any Credit is repaid, in whole or in part, by the
beneficiary thereof, you may, in your sole discretion, treat (or
procure the treatment of) such repayment as a reinstatement of
an amount (equal to such repayment) under such Credit. The value
date applied by you to any such reinstatement shall not be
earlier than the date of such repayment and you shall not be
liable for any loss of any nature which we may suffer or incur
and which may arise from any inadvertent or erroneous drawing.
