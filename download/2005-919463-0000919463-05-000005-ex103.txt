                Agreement), (B) no Default or Event of Default has
                occurred and is continuing or would result after giving

                Term Loan as set forth in the applicable Incremental

                Eurodollar Rate as defined substantially in this
                Agreement and the maximum Applicable Margin in respect
                of such Incremental Term Loan shall not be greater than
                0.50% above the Applicable Margin then in effect, or
                which could be in effect under any set of circumstances

                Loan shall otherwise be on the same terms and conditions

                this Agreement, (E) the aggregate principal amount
                outstanding of Incremental Term Loans pursuant to this

                then outstanding, (G) the average weighted maturity of
                all Incremental Term Loans outstanding, after giving
                effect to such Incremental Term Loan, shall not be less

                otherwise for working capital and general corporate

                Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X of the Board
                of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other
                regulation thereof or to violate the Exchange Act...........51

                of all Loans outstanding and, to the extent permitted by
                applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans or
                any fees or other amounts owed hereunder, shall
                thereafter bear interest (including post-petition
                interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or
                other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a
                rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate
                otherwise payable hereunder with respect to the
                applicable Loans (or, in the case of any such fees and
                other amounts, at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess
                of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder for
                Base Rate Loans); provided, in the case of Eurodollar
                Rate Loans, upon the expiration of the Interest Period
                in effect at the time any such increase in interest rate
                is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon
                become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear
                interest payable upon demand at a rate which is 2% per
                annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable
                hereunder for Base Rate Loans.  Payment or acceptance of
                the increased rates of interest provided for in this
                Section 2.11 is not a permitted alternative to timely
                payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event
                of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or
                remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender..............54

                that, except as otherwise provided  in the Collateral
                Documents with respect to amounts realized from the
                exercise of rights with respect to Liens on the
                Collateral, if any of them shall, whether by voluntary
                payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made
                and applied in accordance with the terms hereof),
                through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's
                lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the
                enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents or

                otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit
                treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code,
                receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the
                aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable
                in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts
                then due and owing to such Lender hereunder or under the
                other Credit Documents (collectively, the "AGGREGATE
                AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) which is greater than the
                proportion received by any other Lender in respect of
                the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the
                Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment
                shall (a) notify Administrative Agent and each other
                Lender of the receipt of such payment and (b) apply a
                portion of such payment to purchase participations
                (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each
                seller of a participation simultaneously upon the
                receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment)
                in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so
                that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall
                be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate
                Amounts Due to them; provided, if all or part of such
                proportionately greater payment received by such
                purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such
                Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company
                or otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the
                purchase prices paid for such participations shall be
                returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent
                of such recovery, but without interest.  Company
                expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and
                agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased
                may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien,
                set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all
                monies owing by Company to that holder with respect
                thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount
                of the participation held by that holder....................63

          2.22. OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE.  Each Lender agrees that, as
                promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender
                responsible for administering its Commitments, Loans or
                Letters of Credit, as the case may be, becomes aware of
                the occurrence of an event or the existence of a
                condition that would cause such Lender to become an
                Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to
                receive payments under Section 2.19, 2.20 or 2.21, it
                will, to the extent not inconsistent with the internal
                policies of such Lender and any applicable legal or
                regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to (a)

<PAGE>

                make, issue, fund or maintain its Commitments, Loans and
                Letters of Credit, including any Affected Loans, through
                another office of such Lender, or (b) take such other
                measures as such Lender may deem reasonable, if as a
                result thereof the circumstances which would cause such
                Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or
                the additional amounts which would otherwise be required
                to be paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.19, 2.20
                or 2.21 would be materially reduced and if, as
                determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, the
                making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such
                Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit through such
                other office or in accordance with such other measures,
                as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect
                such Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit or the
                interests of such Lender; provided, such Lender will not

                including Fiscal Year 2010 (the "PROJECTIONS") are based
                on good faith estimates and reasonable assumptions made
                by the management of Holdings; provided, the Projections
                are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results
                during the period or periods covered by the Projections
                may differ from such Projections and that the
                differences may be material; provided further, as of the
                Effective Date, management of Holdings believed that the
                Projections were reasonable and attainable..................83
          4.10. NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.  Since December 27, 2003, no
                event, circumstance or change has occurred that has

                aggregate, a continuing Material Adverse Effect.............83
          4.11. ADVERSE PROCEEDINGS, ETC.  There are no Adverse
                Proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, that
                could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
                Effect.  Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries
                (a) is in violation of any applicable laws (including
                Environmental Laws) that, individually or in the

                department, commission, board, bureau, agency or
                instrumentality, domestic or foreign, that, individually
                or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
                have a Material Adverse Effect..............................83
          4.12. PAYMENT OF TAXES.  Except as otherwise permitted under
                Section 5.3, all material tax returns and reports of

                and franchises which are due and payable have been paid
                when due and payable.  Holdings knows of no proposed tax
                assessment against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
                which is not being actively contested by Holdings or
                such Subsidiary in good faith and by appropriate
                proceedings; provided, such reserves or other
                appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be required in
                conformity with GAAP shall have been made or provided
                therefor....................................................83

                Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Facilities or
                operations are subject to any outstanding written order,
                consent decree or settlement agreement with any Person
                relating to any Environmental Law, any Environmental
                Claim, or any Hazardous Materials Activity, (ii) there
                are and, to each of Holdings' and its Subsidiaries'
                knowledge, have been, no conditions, occurrences, or
                Hazardous Materials Activities which could reasonably be
                expected to form the basis of an Environmental Claim
                against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
                neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries has
                received any letter or request for information under

                Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C.
                {section} 9604) or any comparable state law, in each of
                cases (i), (ii) and (iii) that, if resolved adversely,
                individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
                expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Compliance
                with all current or reasonably foreseeable future
                requirements pursuant to or under Environmental Laws
                could not reasonably be expected to have, individually
                or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.  No
                event or condition has occurred or is occurring with
                respect to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries relating
                to any applicable Environmental Law, any Release of
                Hazardous Materials, or any Hazardous Materials Activity
                which individually or in the aggregate has had, or could
                reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
                Effect, other than the events and conditions described
                on Schedule 4.14 as existing on or prior to the
                Effective Date..............................................84
          4.15. NO DEFAULTS.  Neither Holdings nor any of its
                Subsidiaries is in default in the performance,
                observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations,

                                          xiii
<PAGE>

                covenants or conditions contained in any of its
                Contractual Obligations, and no condition exists which,
                with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
                could constitute such a default, except where the
                consequences, direct or indirect, of such default or
                defaults, if any, could not reasonably be expected to
                have a Material Adverse Effect..............................85
          4.16. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.  Neither Holdings nor any of
                its Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the
                Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
                Power Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or under
                any other federal or state statute or regulation which
                may limit its ability to incur Indebtedness or which may
                otherwise render all or any portion of the Obligations
                unenforceable.  Neither Holdings nor any of its
                Subsidiaries is a "registered investment company" or a
                company "controlled" by a "registered investment
                company" or a "principal underwriter" of a "registered
                investment company" as such terms are defined in the
                Investment Company Act of 1940..............................85
          4.17. MARGIN STOCK.  Neither Holdings nor any of its
                Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its
                important activities, in the business of extending
                credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
                Margin Stock.  No part of the proceeds of the Loans made
                to such Credit Party will be used to purchase or carry
                any such margin stock or to extend credit to others for
                the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such margin
                stock or for any purpose that violates, or is
                inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or
                X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
                System......................................................85
          4.18. EMPLOYEE MATTERS.  Neither Holdings nor any of its
                Subsidiaries is engaged in any unfair labor practice
                that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
                Adverse Effect.  There is (a) no unfair labor practice
                complaint pending against Holdings or any of its
                Subsidiaries, or to the best knowledge of Holdings and
                Company, threatened against any of them before the
                National Labor Relations Board and no grievance or
                arbitration proceeding arising out of or under any
                collective bargaining agreement that is so pending
                against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or to the
                best knowledge of Holdings and Company, threatened
                against any of them, (b) no strike or work stoppage in
                existence or threatened involving Holdings or any of its
                Subsidiaries,  and (c) to the best knowledge of Holdings
                and Company, no union representation question existing
                with respect to the employees of Holdings or any of its
                Subsidiaries and, to the best knowledge of Holdings and

                clause (a), (b) or (c) above, either individually or in
                the aggregate) such as is not reasonably likely to have
                a Material Adverse Effect...................................85
          4.19. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.  Except as, individually or in
                the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have
                a Material Adverse Effect, (i) Holdings, each of its
                Subsidiaries and each of their respective ERISA

                a favorable determination letter from the Internal
                Revenue Service indicating that such Employee Benefit
                Plan is so qualified and nothing has occurred subsequent
                to the issuance of such determination letter which would
                cause such Employee Benefit Plan to lose its qualified
                status, (iii) no liability to the PBGC (other than
                required premium payments) has been or is expected to be

                individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
                be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect..........86
          4.23. DISCLOSURE.  No representation or warranty of any Credit
                Party contained in any Credit Document or in any other

                warranty is made contains any untrue statement of a
                material fact or omits to state a material fact (known
                to Holdings or Company, in the case of any document not
                furnished by either of them) necessary in order to make
                the statements contained herein or therein not
                misleading in light of the circumstances in which the
                same were made.  Any projections and pro forma financial

                good faith estimates and assumptions believed by

                actual results during the period or periods covered by
                any such projections may differ materially from the

                known) to Holdings or Company (other than matters of a
                general economic nature) that, individually or in the

                Subsidiaries shall be required to preserve any such
                existence, right or franchise, licenses and permits if
                such Person's board of directors (or similar governing
                body) shall determine that the preservation thereof is
                no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of
                such Person, and that the loss thereof could not

                when any penalty or fine shall be incurred with respect
                thereto; provided, no such Tax or claim need be paid if
                it is being contested in good faith by appropriate
                proceedings promptly instituted and diligently
                conducted, so long as (a) adequate reserve or other
                appropriate provision, as shall be required in

                (b) in the case of a charge or claim which has or may
                become a Lien against any of the Collateral, such
                contest proceedings conclusively operate to stay the
                sale of any portion of the Collateral to satisfy such

                such terms and conditions as shall be customary for such

                Flood Hazard Property that is located in a community

                amount of Consolidated Total Debt (excluding any

                manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty.
                Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is
                made on any date by a Guarantor (a "FUNDING GUARANTOR")

                Guarantors in the amount of such other Contributing
                Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall as of such date, with
                the result that all such contributions will cause each

                amount paid or distributed on or before such date by all
                Funding Guarantors under this Guaranty in respect of the
                obligations Guaranteed.  "FAIR SHARE SHORTFALL" means,
                with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date
                of determination, the excess, if any, of the Fair Share
                of such Contributing Guarantor over the Aggregate

                Payments of such Contributing Guarantor.  "FAIR SHARE
                CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT" means, with respect to a
                Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination,
                the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations of such
                Contributing Guarantor under this Guaranty that would
                not render its obligations hereunder or thereunder
                subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or
                conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United
                States Code or any comparable applicable provisions of
                state law; provided, solely for purposes of calculating
                the "FAIR SHARE CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT" with respect to any
                Contributing Guarantor for purposes of this Section 7.2,
                any assets or liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor
                arising by virtue of any rights to subrogation,
                reimbursement or indemnification or any rights to or
                obligations of contribution hereunder shall not be
                considered as assets or liabilities of such Contributing
                Guarantor.  "AGGREGATE PAYMENTS" means, with respect to
                a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of
                determination, an amount equal to (1) the aggregate
                amount of all payments and distributions made on or
                before such date by such Contributing Guarantor in
                respect of this Guaranty (including, without limitation,
                in respect of this Section 7.2), minus (2) the aggregate
                amount of all payments received on or before such date
                by such Contributing Guarantor from the other
                Contributing Guarantors as contributions under this
                Section 7.2.  The amounts payable as contributions
                hereunder shall be determined as of the date on which
                the related payment or distribution is made by the
                applicable Funding Guarantor.  The allocation among
                Contributing Guarantors of their obligations as set
                forth in this Section 7.2 shall not be construed in any
                way to limit the liability of any Contributing Guarantor
                hereunder.  Each Guarantor is a third party beneficiary
                to the contribution agreement set forth in this Section
                7.2........................................................112

                furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of
                any other right which any Beneficiary may have at law or
                in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, that
                upon the failure of Company to pay any of the Guaranteed
                Obligations when and as the same shall become due,
                whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment,
                declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise
                (including amounts that would become due but for the
                operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of
                the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.  {section} 362(a)),

                sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guaranteed
                Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid
                interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (including
                interest which, but for Company's becoming the subject
                of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued
                on such Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not a claim
                is allowed against Company for such interest in the
                related bankruptcy case) and all other Guaranteed
                Obligations then owed to Beneficiaries as aforesaid........113
          7.4.  LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE.  Each Guarantor agrees
                that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable,
                absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be
                affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal
                or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other
                than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations or
                the release of such Guarantor permitted by the Credit
                Documents.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without
                limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees
                as follows:................................................113

                Company, any other guarantor (including any other
                Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
                Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security

                disability or other defense of Company or any other
                Guarantor including any defense based on or arising out
                of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the
                Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement or instrument
                relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the
                liability of Company or any other Guarantor from any
                cause other than payment in full of the Guaranteed
                Obligations; (c) any defense based upon any statute or

                surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other
                respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (d)
                any defense based upon any Beneficiary's errors or
                omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed
                Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith;

                terms hereof and any legal or equitable discharge of
                such Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit
                of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's
                liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any
                rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and
                (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any
                Beneficiary protect, secure, perfect or insure any
                security interest or lien or any property subject
                thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentments, protests,

                any thereof; and (g) any defenses or benefits that may
                be derived from or afforded by law which limit the
                liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or
                which may conflict with the terms hereof...................115
          7.6.  GUARANTORS' RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC.
                Until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
                indefeasibly paid in full and the Revolving Commitments
                shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall
                have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor hereby
                waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect,
                that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have
                against Company or any other Guarantor or any of its
                assets in connection with this Guaranty or the
                performance by such Guarantor of its obligations
                hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or
                remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute,
                under common law or otherwise and including without
                limitation (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement
                or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may
                hereafter have against Company with respect to the
                Guaranteed Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to
                participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any
                Beneficiary now has or may hereafter have against
                Company, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to
                participate in, any collateral or security now or
                hereafter held by any Beneficiary.  In addition, until
                the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly
                paid in full and the Revolving Commitments shall have
                terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired
                or been cancelled, each Guarantor shall withhold

                have against any other guarantor (including any other
                Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations, including,
                without limitation, any such right of contribution as
                contemplated by Section 7.2.  Each Guarantor further
                agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to
                withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation,
                reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set
                forth herein is found by a court of competent
                jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any
                rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification
                such Guarantor may have against Company or against any
                collateral or security, and any rights of contribution
                such Guarantor may have against any such other
                guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights
                any Beneficiary may have against Company, to all right,
                title and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such
                collateral or security, and to any right any Beneficiary
                may have against such other guarantor.  If any amount
                shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such
                subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or
                contribution rights at any time when all Guaranteed
                Obligations shall not have been finally and indefeasibly
                paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for
                Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and
                shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for
                the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied
                against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
                unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.............116
          7.7.  SUBORDINATION OF OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  Any Indebtedness of
                Company or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any
                Guarantor (the "OBLIGEE GUARANTOR") is hereby
                subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed
                Obligations, and any such indebtedness collected or
                received by the Obligee Guarantor after an Event of
                Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in
                trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of
                Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to
                Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to
                be credited and applied against the Guaranteed
                Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting
                in any manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor
                under any other provision hereof...........................117
          7.8.  CONTINUING GUARANTY.  This Guaranty is a continuing
                guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the
                Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full and
                the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all
                Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled.

                Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to
                revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions giving
                rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.........................117
          7.9.  AUTHORITY OF GUARANTORS OR COMPANY.  It is not necessary
                for any Beneficiary to inquire into the capacity or
                powers of any Guarantor or Company or the officers,
                directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on
                behalf of any of them......................................117
          7.10. FINANCIAL CONDITION OF COMPANY.  Any Credit Extension
                may be made to Company or continued from time to time,
                and any Financial Hedge Agreements may be entered into
                from time to time, in each case without notice to or
                authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the
                financial or other condition of Company at the time of
                any such grant or continuation or at the time such
                Financial Hedge Agreement is entered into, as the case
                may be.  No Beneficiary shall have any obligation to
                disclose or discuss with any Guarantor its assessment,
                or any Guarantor's assessment, of the financial
                condition of Company.  Each Guarantor has adequate means
                to obtain information from Company on a continuing basis
                concerning the financial condition of Company and its
                ability to perform its obligations under the Credit
                Documents and the Financial Hedge Agreements, and each
                Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and
                keeping informed of the financial condition of Company
                and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of
                nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Each
                Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the
                part of any Beneficiary to disclose any matter, fact or
                thing relating to the business, operations or conditions
                of Company now known or hereafter known by any
                Beneficiary................................................117
          7.11. BANKRUPTCY, ETC.  (a)  Without limiting any Guarantor's
                ability to file a voluntary bankruptcy petition in
                respect of itself, so long as any Guaranteed Obligations
                remain outstanding, no Guarantor shall, without the
                prior written consent of Administrative Agent acting
                pursuant to the instructions of Requisite Lenders,
                commence or join with any other Person in commencing any
                bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency case or
                proceeding of or against Company or any other Guarantor.
                The obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall not be
                reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred,
                suspended or terminated by any case or proceeding,
                voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy,
                insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or
                arrangement of Company or any other Guarantor or by any
                defense which Company or any other Guarantor may have by
                reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or
                administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.....118

                the Capital Stock of any Guarantor or any of its
                successors in interest hereunder shall be sold or
                otherwise disposed of (including by merger or
                consolidation) in a transaction consummated in

                automatically be discharged and released without any

                each Agent shall have the same rights and powers
                hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same
                as if it were not performing the duties and functions

                Agent, to the extent that such Agent shall not have been
                reimbursed by any Credit Party, for and against any and

                be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such
                Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or

                costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such
                Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  If any
                indemnity furnished to any Agent for any purpose shall,
                in the opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become
                impaired, such Agent may call for additional indemnity
                and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
                against until such additional indemnity is furnished;
                provided, in no event shall this sentence require any

                to indemnify any Agent against any liability,

                the contemplated assignment, transfer or participation

                request by any governmental agency or representative

                relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.

                Affiliates, and their and their respective Affiliates'
                directors and employees to comply with applicable
                securities laws.  For this purpose, "tax structure"
                means any facts relevant to the federal income tax
                treatment of the transactions contemplated by this
                Agreement but does not include information relating to

          10.18.USURY SAVINGS CLAUSE.  Notwithstanding any other
                provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged
                with respect to any of the Obligations, including all
                charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the
                nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed
                the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the rate of interest
                (determined without regard to the preceding sentence)
                under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest
                Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made
                hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate
                until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals
                the amount of interest which would have been due
                hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in
                this Agreement had at all times been in effect.  In
                addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in
                full the total interest due hereunder (taking into
                account the increase provided for above) is less than
                the total amount of interest which would have been due
                hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in
                this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to
                the extent permitted by law, Company shall pay to
                Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference
                between the amount of interest paid and the amount of
                interest which would have been paid if the Highest
                Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of
                Lenders and Company to conform strictly to any
                applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if any Lender
                contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration
                which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest
                Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled
                automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such
                Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of
                the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to Company.........139
          10.19.COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any
                number of counterparts, each of which when so executed
                and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such
                counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
                same instrument............................................136

warrant  that),  after giving effect to such issuance,  amendment,  renewal  or
extension (i) the  Letter of Credit Usage shall not exceed the Letter of Credit
Sublimit and (ii) the  Total  Utilization  of  Revolving  Commitments shall not

                                    43

<PAGE>
the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit  (or,  in  the  case  of  any
renewal  or  extension  thereof,  one year after such renewal or extension) and
(ii) the date that is five Business  Days  prior  to  the  Revolving Commitment
Termination Date.

             (d)    Participations.  By the issuance, renewal or extension of a
Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing  the  amount
thereof)  and  without  any  further  action on the part of Issuing Bank or the
Lenders, Issuing Bank hereby grants to  each  Lender,  and  each  Lender hereby
acquires from Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit  equal  to
such Lender's Pro Rata Share (with respect to the Revolving Commitments) of the
aggregate  amount  available  to  be  drawn  under  such  Letter of Credit.  In
consideration  and  in  furtherance  of  the  foregoing,  each  Lender   hereby
absolutely  and unconditionally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, for  the
account of Issuing  Bank,  such  Lender's  Pro  Rata Share (with respect to the
Revolving Commitments) of each Letter of Credit Disbursement  made  by  Issuing
Bank and not reimbursed by Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e)
of  this  Section,  or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded  to
Company  for  any  reason.   Each  Lender  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  its
obligation to acquire  participations  pursuant to this paragraph in respect of
Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional  and  shall  not be affected by
any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal  or  extension of
any  Letter  of  Credit  or  the  occurrence  and  continuance of a Default  or
reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that  each  such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

             (e)    Reimbursement.  If Issuing Bank shall make  any  Letter  of
Credit  Disbursement  in respect of a Letter of Credit, Company shall reimburse
such Letter of Credit Disbursement  by paying to Administrative Agent an amount
equal to such Letter of Credit Disbursement  not later than 2:30 p.m., New York
City  time, on the date that such Letter of Credit  Disbursement  is  made,  if
Company  shall have received notice of such Letter of Credit Disbursement prior
to 10:00 a.m.,  New  York  City  time, on such date, or, if such notice has not
been received by Company prior to  such  time on such date, then not later than
2:30 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the  Business  Day  that Company receives
such  notice,  if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m.,  New  York  City
time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the
day that Company  receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to
such  time on the day  of  receipt;  provided,  Company  may,  subject  to  the
conditions  to  borrowing  set forth herein, request in accordance with Section
2.3 or Section 2.5 that such  payment be financed with a Revolving Loan that is
a Base Rate Loan or a Swing Line  Loan  in  an  equivalent  amount  and, to the
extent  so  financed,  Company's  obligation  to  make  such  payment  shall be
discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Loan or Swing Line Loan.  If
Company fails to make such payment when due, Administrative Agent shall  notify
each  Lender  of the applicable Letter of Credit Disbursement, the payment then
due from Company  in  respect thereof and such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof.
Following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent
its Pro Rata Share of the  payment then due from Company, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.5 with respect to Loans  made by such Lender (and Section
2.5 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations  of the Lenders),

                                    44

<PAGE>
and  Administrative  Agent shall promptly  pay  to Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by Administrative
Agent of any payment from Company pursuant  to  this paragraph, Administrative
Agent shall distribute  such  payment  to  Issuing Bank or, to the extent that
Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph  to   reimburse  Issuing
Bank, then to such Lenders and Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any
payment  made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse Issuing Bank
for any Letter of Credit Disbursement (other  than  the  funding  of Revolving
Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve
Company of its obligation to reimburse such Letter of Credit Disbursement.

             (f)    Obligations   Absolute.    The   Company's   obligation  to
reimburse Letter of Credit Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e)  of  this
Section  shall  be  absolute,  unconditional  and  irrevocable,  and  shall  be
performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and
all  circumstances  whatsoever  and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit  or  this  Agreement,  or  any  term  or
provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
Credit  proving  to  be  forged,  fraudulent  or  invalid in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any  respect,  (iii) payment by
Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a  draft or other
document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit,  or (iv)
any  other  event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any  of
the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a
legal or equitable  discharge  of,  or  provide  a  right  of  setoff  against,
Company's obligations hereunder.  Neither Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor
Issuing  Bank,  nor  any  of  their  Affiliates,  shall  have  any liability or
responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or  transfer  of
any  Letter  of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder
(irrespective  of  any  of  the  circumstances  referred  to  in  the preceding
sentence),  or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission
or delivery of  any  draft,  notice or other communication under or relating to
any  Letter of Credit (including  any  document  required  to  make  a  drawing
thereunder),  any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence
arising from causes  beyond  the  reasonable control of Issuing Bank; provided,
the foregoing shall not be construed  to  excuse Issuing Bank from liability to
Company  to  the  extent of any direct damages  (as  opposed  to  consequential
damages, claims in  respect of which are hereby waived by Company to the extent
permitted by applicable  law)  suffered  by  Company that are caused by Issuing
Bank's  failure  to exercise care when determining  whether  drafts  and  other
documents presented  under  a  Letter  of Credit comply with the terms thereof.
The parties hereto expressly agree that,  in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of Issuing Bank  (as  finally  determined  by  a
court  of  competent  jurisdiction),  Issuing  Bank  shall  be  deemed  to have
exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and
without  limiting  the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect
to documents presented  which  appear  on  their  face  to  be  in  substantial
compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank may, in  its sole
discretion,  either  accept  and  make  payment  upon  such  documents  without
responsibility   for   further  investigation,  regardless  of  any  notice  or
information to the contrary,  or  refuse  to  accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

                                    45

<PAGE>
             (g)    Disbursement  Procedures.   Issuing  Bank  shall,  promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents  purporting to represent a
demand  for  payment  under  a Letter of Credit.  Issuing Bank  shall  promptly
notify Administrative Agent and Company by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of
such demand for payment and whether Issuing Bank has made or will make a Letter
of Credit Disbursement thereunder;  provided,  any  failure to give or delay in
giving  such  notice shall not relieve Company of its obligation  to  reimburse
Issuing Bank and  the  Lenders  with  respect  to  any  such  Letter  of Credit
Disbursement.

             (h)    Interim Interest.  If Issuing Bank shall make any Letter of
Credit Disbursement, then, unless Company shall reimburse such Letter of Credit
Disbursement  in  full on the date such Letter of Credit Disbursement is  made,
the unpaid amount thereof  shall bear interest, for each day from and including
the date such Letter of Credit  Disbursement  is made to but excluding the date
that Company reimburses such Letter of Credit Disbursement,  at  the  rate  per
annum then applicable to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans; provided, if
Company fails to reimburse such Letter of Credit Disbursement when due pursuant
to  paragraph (e)  of this Section, then such unpaid amount shall bear interest
at a rate which is 2%  per  annum  in  excess of the rate of interest otherwise
applicable  to  Revolving Loans that are Base  Rate  Loans.   Interest  accrued
pursuant to this  paragraph  shall  be  for the account of Issuing Bank, except
that interest accrued on and after the date  of  payment by any Lender pursuant
to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse Issuing  Bank  shall  be  for the
account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

             (i)    Replacement  of  Issuing  Bank;  Additional  Issuing Banks.
(i) Issuing  Bank  may  be  replaced  at  any  time by written agreement  among
Company,  Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing  Bank  and  the  successor
Issuing Bank.   Administrative  Agent  shall  notify  the  Lenders  of any such
replacement  of  Issuing  Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall  become
effective, Company shall pay  all  unpaid  fees  accrued for the account of the
replaced  Issuing  Bank.   From  and  after  the effective  date  of  any  such
replacement,  (A) the successor Issuing Bank shall  have  all  the  rights  and
obligations of  Issuing  Bank  under  this Agreement with respect to Letters of
Credit to be issued thereafter and (B)  references  herein to the term "Issuing
Bank"  shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to  any  previous  Issuing
Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall
require.   After  the  replacement  of  an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced
Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto  and  shall  continue  to have all the
rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with  respect to
Letters  of  Credit  issued  by it prior to such replacement, but shall not  be
required to issue additional Letters  of Credit.  A Revolving Lender may become
an Issuing Bank pursuant to a written agreement  among  Company, Administrative
Agent and such Revolving Lender (an "ADDITIONAL ISSUING BANK"), but only if the
Issuing Bank has an insufficiently high credit rating for  the  issuance of the

                                    46

<PAGE>
requested Letter of Credit, whereupon Administrative Agent shall  notify  other
Revolving Lenders of such Additional Issuing Bank.  Upon becoming an Additional
Issuing  Bank,  all  references  to  "Issuing  Bank"  herein shall be deemed to
include  such  Additional  Issuing  Bank for the purposes of  such  Letters  of
Credit.

             (j)    Cash Collateralization.   If  any  Event  of  Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that Company receives  notice from
Administrative Agent or the Requisite Class Lenders (or, if the maturity of the
Loans  has  been  accelerated,  Issuing  Bank)  demanding  the  deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph, Company shall deposit in an account with
Administrative Agent, in the name of Administrative Agent and for  the  benefit
of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the Letter of Credit Exposure  as of
such  date  plus  any  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  thereon;  provided,  the
obligation  to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately,
and such deposit  shall  become  immediately due and payable, without demand or
other notice of any kind, upon the  occurrence  of  any  Event  of Default with
respect to Company described in Section 8.1(f) or 8.1(g). Such deposit shall be
held by Administrative Agent as collateral for the  payment and  performance of
the obligations  of Company  under this Agreement. Administrative  Agent  shall
have exclusive dominion and control,including the exclusive right of withdrawal,
over such account.  Other than  any  interest  earned on the investment of such
deposits, which investments shall be made at the  option and sole discretion of
Administrative Agent and at Company's risk and expense, such deposits shall not
bear  interest.   Interest  or  profits,  if  any,  on such  investments  shall
accumulate  in  such  account.   Moneys  in such account shall  be  applied  by
Administrative  Agent  to  reimburse  Issuing   Bank   for   Letter  of  Credit
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the  extent  not  so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
Company at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but
subject  to  the  consent  of   Issuing  Bank),  be  applied  to  satisfy other
obligations of Company under this Agreement.  If Company is required to provide
an  amount  of  cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence  of  an
Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be
promptly returned  to  Company  after  all Events of Default have been cured or
waived.

       2.5.  SWING LINE LOANS.

             (a)    Swing  Line  Loans  Commitment.    During   the   Revolving
Commitment  Period,  subject  to  the  terms  and conditions hereof, Swing Line
Lender  hereby  agrees to make Swing Line Loans to  Company  in  the  aggregate
amount up to but  not exceeding the Swing Line Sublimit; provided, after giving
effect to the making  of  any  Swing  Line  Loan,  in  no event shall the Total
Utilization of Revolving Commitments exceed the Revolving  Commitments  then in
effect.   Amounts  borrowed  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.5 may be repaid and
reborrowed  during  the  Revolving  Commitment  Period.   Swing  Line  Lender's
Revolving Commitment shall expire on the Revolving Commitment Termination  Date
and  Company  shall  repay  the then unpaid principal amount of each Swing Line
Loan and any accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon as of the earlier of (i) the
Revolving  Commitment Termination Date, (ii)  any  date  on  which  Company  is

                                    47

<PAGE>
borrowing Revolving  Loans  and (iii) the first date at least two Business Days
after such Swing Line Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of any calendar
month.

             (b)    Borrowing Mechanics for Swing Line Loans.

                    (i)   Swing  Line  Loans  shall  be  made  in  an aggregate
       minimum  amount  of  $1,000,000  and  integral multiples of $100,000  in
       excess of that amount.

                    (ii)  Whenever Company desires  that Swing Line Lender make
       a Swing Line Loan, Company shall deliver to Swing  Line  Lender,  with a
       copy  to  Agents  (subject  to Section 3.2(b)) a Funding Notice no later
       than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the proposed Credit Date.

                    (iii) Swing Line  Lender shall make the amount of its Swing
       Line Loan available to Administrative  Agent  not  later  than 2:00 p.m.
       (New York City time) on the applicable Credit Date by wire  transfer  of
       same  day  funds in Dollars, at Administrative Agent's Principal Office.
       Except as provided herein, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
       precedent specified herein, Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds
       of such Swing  Line  Loans available to Company on the applicable Credit
       Date by causing an amount  of  same  day  funds  in Dollars equal to the
       proceeds of all such Swing Line Loans received by  Administrative  Agent
       from  Swing  Line  Lender  to  be  credited  to an account designated in
       writing to Administrative Agent by Company.

                    (iv)  With respect to any Swing Line  Loans  which have not
       been prepaid by Company pursuant to Section 2.14 or Section  2.15, Swing
       Line Lender may at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, deliver
       to  Administrative  Agent (with a copy to Company), no later than  11:00
       a.m. (New York City time)  at  least  one Business Day in advance of the
       proposed Credit Date, a notice (which shall  be  deemed  to be a Funding
       Notice given by Company) requesting that each Lender holding a Revolving
       Commitment make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to  Company  on
       such  Credit  Date  in  an amount equal to the amount of such Swing Line
       Loans (the "REFUNDED SWING  LINE  LOANS")  outstanding  on the date such
       notice  is  given  which Swing Line Lender requests Lenders  to  prepay.
       Anything contained in  this  Agreement  to the contrary notwithstanding,
       (1) the proceeds of such Revolving Loans  made by the Lenders other than
       Swing Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by Administrative Agent
       to  Swing  Line  Lender  (and not to Company) and  applied  to  repay  a
       corresponding portion of the  Refunded  Swing  Line Loans and (2) on the
       day such Revolving Loans are made, Swing Line Lender's Pro Rata Share of
       the  Refunded  Swing  Line Loans shall be deemed to  be  paid  with  the
       proceeds of a Revolving  Loan  made by Swing Line Lender to Company, and
       such portion of the Swing Line Loans  deemed  to  be  so  paid  shall no
       longer  be  outstanding  as Swing Line Loans and shall no longer be  due
       under  the Swing Line Note  of  Swing  Line  Lender  but  shall  instead

                                    48

<PAGE>
       constitute  part  of  Swing Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans to
       Company and shall be due under the Revolving Loan Note issued by Company
       to Swing Line Lender.   Company  hereby  authorizes Administrative Agent
       and Swing Line Lender to charge Company's  accounts  with Administrative
       Agent  and Swing Line Lender (up to the amount available  in  each  such
       account) in order to immediately pay Swing Line Lender the amount of the
       Refunded  Swing  Line Loans to the extent the proceeds of such Revolving
       Loans made by Lenders, including the Revolving Loan deemed to be made by
       Swing Line Lender,  are  not  sufficient  to  repay in full the Refunded
       Swing Line Loans.  If any portion of any such amount  paid (or deemed to
       be  paid) to Swing Line Lender should be recovered by or  on  behalf  of
       Company  from  Swing  Line  Lender  in bankruptcy, by assignment for the
       benefit of creditors or otherwise, the  loss  of the amount so recovered
       shall be ratably shared among all the Revolving Lenders.

                    (v)   If  for  any  reason Revolving  Loans  are  not  made
       pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(iv) in  an  amount  sufficient  to  repay any
       amounts  owed  to Swing Line Lender in respect of any outstanding  Swing
       Line Loans on or  before the third Business Day after demand for payment
       thereof by Swing Line Lender, each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment
       shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have purchased a participation
       in such outstanding  Swing Line Loans, and in an amount equal to its Pro
       Rata  Share  of  the applicable  unpaid  amount  together  with  accrued
       interest thereon.   Upon  one  Business  Day's  notice  from  Swing Line
       Lender,  each  Lender  holding  a Revolving Commitment shall deliver  to
       Swing Line Lender an amount equal to its respective participation in the
       applicable unpaid amount in same  day  funds  at the Principal Office of
       Swing Line Lender. In order to evidence such participation  each  Lender
       holding  a  Revolving  Commitment  agrees  to enter into a participation
       agreement  at the request of Swing Line Lender  in  form  and  substance
       reasonably satisfactory  to  Swing Line Lender.  In the event any Lender
       holding a Revolving Commitment  fails  to  make  available to Swing Line
       Lender  the amount of such Lender's participation as  provided  in  this
       paragraph, Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on
       demand from  such  Lender  together  with  interest  thereon  for  three
       Business Days at the rate customarily used by Swing Line Lender for  the
       correction  of  errors  among  banks and thereafter at the Base Rate, as
       applicable.

                    (vi)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein  to  the
       contrary,  (1)  each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans for the
       purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans pursuant to the second
       preceding  paragraph   and   each  Lender's  obligation  to  purchase  a
       participation in any unpaid Swing Line Loans pursuant to the immediately
       preceding paragraph shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
       affected  by any circumstance,  including  without  limitation  (A)  any
       set-off, counterclaim,  recoupment,  defense  or  other right which such
       Lender may have against Swing Line Lender, any Credit Party or any other
       Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence  or continuation of
       a Default or Event of Default; (C) any adverse change in  the  business,

                                    49

<PAGE>
       operations,  properties,  assets, condition (financial or otherwise)  or
       prospects of any Credit Party;  (D)  any breach of this Agreement or any
       other  Credit  Document  by  any  party  thereto;   or   (E)  any  other
       circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not  similar  to
       any  of  the foregoing; and (2) Swing Line Lender shall not be obligated
       to make any  Swing  Line  Loans (A) if it has elected not to do so after
       the occurrence and during the  continuation  of  a  Default  or Event of
       Default or (B) at a time when a Funding Default exists unless Swing Line
       Lender  has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it and Company  to
       eliminate  Swing  Line  Lender's  risk  with  respect  to the Defaulting
       Lender's  participation  in  such  Swing  Ling Loan, including  by  cash
       collateralizing  such  Defaulting  Lender's  Pro   Rata   Share  of  the
       outstanding Swing Line Loans.

       2.6.  PRO RATA SHARES; AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

             (a)    Pro  Rata  Shares.   All  Loans  shall  be  made,  and  all
participations  purchased,  by  Lenders  simultaneously and proportionately  to
their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being  understood  that no Lender shall be
responsible  for  any  default  by  any  other  Lender  in such other  Lender's
obligation  to  make  a  Loan requested hereunder or purchase  a  participation
required  hereby nor shall  any  Commitment  of  any  Lender  be  increased  or
decreased as  a  result of a default by any other Lender in such other Lender's
obligation to make  a  Loan  requested  hereunder  or  purchase a participation
required hereby.

             (b)    Availability of Funds.  Unless Administrative  Agent  shall
have  been notified by any Lender prior to the applicable Credit Date that such
Lender  does not intend to make available to Administrative Agent the amount of
such Lender's  Loan  requested  on  such  Credit Date, Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such amount  available to Administrative Agent
on such Credit Date and Administrative Agent may,  in  its sole discretion, but
shall not be obligated to, make available to Company a corresponding  amount on
such  Credit  Date.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available
to Administrative  Agent by such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to recover such corresponding  amount  on demand from such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date until the date such amount
is paid to Administrative Agent, at the  customary  rate  set by Administrative
Agent  for  the  correction of errors among banks for three Business  Days  and
thereafter at the  Base  Rate.   If such Lender does not pay such corresponding
amount forthwith upon Administrative  Agent's  demand  therefor, Administrative
Agent  shall  promptly  notify Company and Company shall immediately  pay  such
corresponding amount to Administrative  Agent  together  with interest thereon,
for  each  day  from  such Credit Date until the date such amount  is  paid  to
Administrative Agent, at  the  rate  payable  hereunder for Base Rate Loans for
such Class of Loans.  Nothing in this Section 2.6(b) shall be deemed to relieve
any  Lender  from  its  obligation to fulfill  its  Term  Loan  Commitment, its
Revolving Commitment or its obligation to purchase participations in Letters of
Credit pursuant to  Section 2.4(d) hereunder or  to prejudice  any  rights that
Company may  have  against  any  Lender  as  a result of any  default  by  such
Lender hereunder.

                                    50

<PAGE>
       2.7.  USE OF PROCEEDS.  The proceeds  of  the  Term  Loans  made  on the
Effective Date shall be applied by Company on the Effective Date to prepay Term
Loans and Delayed Draw Loans (as defined in the Existing Agreement) outstanding
under  the  Existing  Agreement  and,  after  prepayment of such Term Loans and
Delayed Draw Loans in full, otherwise for working capital and general corporate
purposes of the Company and its Subsidiaries.   The  proceeds  of the Revolving
Loans,  Swing  Line  Loans and Letters of Credit made after the Effective  Date
shall be applied by Company  for Permitted Acquisition Expenses working capital
and general corporate purposes  of  Company  and  its  Subsidiaries;  provided,
however,  in  no  event  will  the  proceeds of Revolving Loans be used for the
purposes of  prepaying  Loans  as  permitted  under  Section 2.14  hereof.  The
proceeds of any  Incremental  Term  Loan  shall be used as  set  forth  in  the
applicable Incremental Term Loan Notice or, where  and so provided, for working
capital  and  general corporate  purposes of Company  and its Subsidiaries.  No
portion of the proceeds of any Credit  Extension  shall  be  used in any manner
that causes or might  cause  such  Credit Extension or the application  of such
proceeds to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X of the  Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System  or any  other regulation thereof or to
violate the Exchange Act.

       2.8.  EVIDENCE OF DEBT; REGISTER; LENDERS' BOOKS AND RECORDS; NOTES.

             (a)    Lenders' Evidence  of  Debt.  Each Lender shall maintain on
its  internal records an account or accounts  evidencing  the  Indebtedness  of
Company  to such Lender, including the amounts of the Loans made by it and each
repayment  and  prepayment  in  respect thereof.  Any such recordation shall be
conclusive and binding on Company,  absent manifest error; provided, failure to
make any such recordation, or any error  in  such recordation, shall not affect
any Lender's Commitments or Company's Obligations  in respect of any applicable
Loans;  and  provided  further, in the event of any inconsistency  between  the
Register and any Lender's  records,  the  recordations  in  the  Register shall
govern.

             (b)    Register.   Administrative  Agent,  acting  on  behalf   of
Company, shall maintain at its Principal Office  a register for the recordation
of  the  names  and  addresses of Lenders and the Commitments and Loans of each
Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER").  The Register shall be available for
inspection by Company  or  any  Lender  at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior request.  Administrative  Agent  shall record in the
Register  the  Commitments and the Loans, and each repayment or  prepayment  in
respect of the principal amount of the Loans, and any such recordation shall be
conclusive and binding  on  Company  and  each  Lender,  absent manifest error;
provided,  failure  to  make  any  such  recordation,  or  any  error  in  such
recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Company's Obligations
in respect of any Loan.  Company hereby designates GSCP to serve  as  Company's
agent  solely  for  purposes  of  maintaining  the Register as provided in this
Section 2.8, and Company hereby agrees that, to the extent GSCP serves  in such
capacity,  GSCP  and  its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates
shall constitute "Indemnitees."

<PAGE>
             (c)    Notes.   If so requested by any Lender by written notice to
Company (with a copy to Administrative  Agent) at least two Business Days prior
to the Effective Date, or at any time thereafter,  Company  shall  execute  and
deliver  to  such  Lender  (and/or,  if  applicable and if so specified in such
notice, to  any Person who is an  assignee of  such  Lender pursuant to Section
10.6)on the Effective Date (or, if such notice is delivered after the Effective
Date, promptly  after  Company's  receipt  of  such  notice) a Note or Notes to
evidence  such Lender's Term Loan, Swing Line Loan, Incremental  Term  Loan  or
Revolving Loan, as the case may be.

       2.9.  INTEREST ON LOANS.

             (a)    Except  as  otherwise  set forth herein, each Class of Loan
shall bear interest on the unpaid principal  amount  thereof from the date made
through repayment (whether by acceleration or otherwise) thereof as follows:

                    (i)   in the case of Revolving Loans:

                          (1)    if a Base Rate Loan,  at  the Base Rate
             plus the Applicable Margin; or

                          (2)    if  a  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan,  at  the
             Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin;

                    (ii)  in the case of Swing Line Loans,  at  the  Base  Rate
       plus the Applicable Margin; and

                    (iii) in the case of Term Loans:

                          (1)    if  a  Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate
             plus the Applicable Margin; or

                          (2)    if  a  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan,  at  the
             Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

             (b)    The basis for determining the rate of interest with respect
to any Loan (except a Swing Line Loan), and the Interest Period with respect to
any  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan,  shall be selected  by  Company  and  notified  to
Administrative Agent and Lenders  pursuant  to the applicable Funding Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be; provided, until the earlier
of (A) the date that Administration Agent notifies  Company  that  the  primary
syndication  of  the  Term Loan Commitments has been completed and (B) the date
that  is  60 days following  the  Effective  Date,  the  Term  Loans  shall  be
maintained  as either (1) Eurodollar Rate Loans having an Interest Period of no
longer than one  month  or  (2)  Base  Rate  Loans.   If  on  any day a Loan is

                                    52
<PAGE>

outstanding  with  respect to which a Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation
Notice has not been  delivered  to  Administrative Agent in accordance with the
terms  hereof specifying the applicable  basis  for  determining  the  rate  of
interest,  then  for  that day such Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan.  Swing Line
Loans shall be made and maintained only as Base Rate Loans.

             (c)    In  connection with Eurodollar Rate Loans there shall be no
more than ten Interest Periods  outstanding  at any time.  In the event Company
fails to specify between a Base Rate Loan or a  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  in  the
applicable  Funding  Notice  or  Conversion/Continuation  Notice, such Loan (if
outstanding as a Eurodollar Rate Loan) will be automatically  converted  into a
Base  Rate  Loan  on  the last day of the then-current Interest Period for such
Loan (or if outstanding  as  a  Base  Rate Loan will remain as, or (if not then
outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan).  In the event Company fails to
specify  an Interest Period for any Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  in  the  applicable
Funding Notice  or  Conversion/Continuation  Notice, Company shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month.   As  soon  as practicable after
10:00  a.m.  (New  York  City  time) on each Interest Rate Determination  Date,
Administrative  Agent  shall  determine   (which  determination  shall,  absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest
rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate  Loans  for which an interest rate
is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period  and shall promptly
give  notice  thereof  (in  writing  or  by telephone confirmed in writing)  to
Company and each Lender.

             (d)    Interest  payable  pursuant  to  Section  2.9(a)  shall  be
computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans  on  the  basis  of  a  365-day  or
366-day  year,  as  the  case  may  be, and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, on the basis of a 360-day year,  in  each  case for the actual number of
days elapsed in the period during which it accrues.   In  computing interest on
any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first  day  of an Interest
Period  applicable  to  such  Loan  or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan  being
converted  from  a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan,  the  date  of  conversion  of  such
Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Base  Rate  Loan,  as  the  case  may be, shall be
included,  and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration  date  of  an
Interest Period  applicable  to  such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan
being converted to a Eurodollar Rate  Loan, the date of conversion of such Base
Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate Loan,  as the case may be, shall be excluded;
provided, if a Loan is repaid on the same  day  on  which it is made, one day's
interest shall be paid on that Loan.

             (e)    Except as otherwise set forth herein, interest on each Loan
shall be payable in arrears on and to (i) each Interest Payment Date applicable
to that Loan; (ii) any prepayment of that Loan, whether voluntary or mandatory,
to  the  extent  accrued  on the amount being prepaid; and  (iii) at  maturity,
including final maturity; provided,  however,  with  respect  to  any voluntary
prepayment  of  a Base Rate Loan, accrued interest shall instead be payable  on
the applicable Interest Payment Date.

                                    53

       2.10. CONVERSION/CONTINUATION.

             (a)    Subject to  Section 2.19 and so long as no Default or Event
of Default shall have occurred and then  be  continuing, Company shall have the
option:

                    (i)   to  convert  at any time all or any part of any  Loan
       equal to $500,000 and integral multiples  of  $100,000 in excess of that
       amount  from  one  Type  of Loan to another Type of  Loan;  provided,  a
       Eurodollar Rate Loan may only  be  converted  on  the  expiration of the
       Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan  unless  Company
       shall  pay  all  amounts  due under Section 2.19 in connection  with any
       such conversion; or

                    (ii)  upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable
       to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any portion of such Loan
       equal to $500,000 and integral  multiples  of $100,000 in excess of that
       amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan.

             (b)    The Company shall deliver a Conversion/Continuation  Notice
to  Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least
one Business  Day in advance of the proposed Conversion/Continuation Notice (in
the case of a conversion  to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days
in advance of the proposed  Conversion/Continuation  Date  (in  the  case  of a

of an Event of Default, the principal amount of all Loans  outstanding  and, to
the  extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans  or
any fees  or  other  amounts  owed  hereunder,  shall  thereafter bear interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under  the  Bankruptcy Code
or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate that is 2% per
annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder  with  respect
to the applicable Loans (or, in the case of any such fees and other amounts, at
a  rate  which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable
hereunder for Base Rate Loans); provided, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans,
upon the expiration  of  the  Interest  Period  in  effect at the time any such
increase  in  interest  rate  is  effective such Eurodollar  Rate  Loans  shall
thereupon become Base Rate Loans and  shall  thereafter  bear  interest payable
upon  demand  at  a  rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest  rate
otherwise payable hereunder  for Base Rate Loans.  Payment or acceptance of the
increased  rates  of  interest  provided  for  in  this  Section 2.11 is  not a
permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of
any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any  rights  or   remedies
of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                    second,  to prepay the Swing Line Loans to the full  extent

Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
due at Administrative  Agent's  Principal  Office  for  the account of Lenders;
funds received by Administrative Agent after that time on  such  due date shall
be deemed to have been paid by Company on the next succeeding Business Day.

             (b)    All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan
(other than voluntary prepayments of Revolving Loans) shall include  payment of
accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and  all such
payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when
interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied  to the
payment of interest before application to principal.

             (c)    Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  distribute  to each
Lender  at such address as such Lender shall indicate in writing, such Lender's
applicable  Pro  Rata  Share  of  all payments and prepayments of principal and
interest due hereunder, together with all other amounts due thereto, including,
without  limitation, all fees payable  with  respect  thereto,  to  the  extent
received by Administrative Agent.

             (d)    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions  hereof, if any
Conversion/Continuation Notice is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any
Affected  Lender  makes  Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share  of  any
Eurodollar  Rate Loans, Administrative  Agent  shall  give  effect  thereto  in
apportioning payments received thereafter.

             (e)    Subject  to  the  provisos  set  forth in the definition of
"Interest Period", whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to
be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment  shall  be made on the
next  succeeding  Business Day and such extension of time shall be included  in
the computation of  the  payment  of  interest  hereunder  or  of the Revolving
Commitment fees hereunder.

             (f)    Company  hereby authorizes Administrative Agent  to  charge
Company's accounts with Administrative  Agent  in order to cause timely payment
to  be  made  to  Administrative  Agent of all principal,  interest,  fees  and
expenses due hereunder (subject to  sufficient  funds  being  available  in its
accounts for that purpose).

             (g)    Administrative Agent shall deem any payment by or on behalf
of  Company  hereunder  that  is not made in same day funds prior to 12:00 p.m.
(New York City time) to be a non-conforming  payment.   Any  such payment shall
not be deemed to have been received by Administrative Agent until  the later of
(i) the  time  such funds become available funds, and (ii) the applicable  next
Business Day.  Administrative  Agent  shall  give  prompt  telephonic notice to
Company  and each applicable Lender (confirmed in writing) if  any  payment  is

                                    62
<PAGE>

non-conforming.   Any non-conforming payment may constitute or become a Default
or Event of Default  in  accordance with the terms of Section 8.1(a).  Interest
shall continue to accrue on  any principal as to which a non-conforming payment
is made until such funds become  available funds (but in no event less than the
period from the date of such payment to the next succeeding applicable Business
Day) at the rate determined pursuant  to  Section 2.9 from the date such amount
was due and payable until the date such amount is paid in full.

             (h)    If  an  Event  of Default  shall  have   occurred  and  not
otherwise been waived, and the maturity  of  the  Obligations  shall  have been
accelerated  pursuant  to  Section  8.1,  all payments or proceeds received  by
Agents  hereunder in respect of any of the Obligations,  shall  be  applied  in
accordance  with  the  application arrangements described in Section 6.5 of the
Pledge and Security Agreement.

       2.18. RATABLE SHARING.   Lenders  hereby  agree  among  themselves that,
except  as  otherwise  provided   in  the Collateral Documents with respect  to
amounts realized from the exercise of rights  with  respect  to  Liens  on  the
Collateral,  if  any  of them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a
voluntary prepayment of  Loans  made  and  applied in accordance with the terms
hereof), through the exercise of any right of  set-off  or  banker's  lien,  by
counterclaim  or  cross  action  or  by  the enforcement of any right under the
Credit Documents or otherwise, or as adequate  protection  of a deposit treated
as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts  payable  in
respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to such
Lender  hereunder  or  under  the  other  Credit  Documents  (collectively, the
"AGGREGATE  AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) which is greater than  the  proportion
received by any  other  Lender  in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such
other Lender, then the Lender receiving  such  proportionately  greater payment
shall (a) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the  receipt  of
such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations
(which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation
simultaneously  upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment)
in the Aggregate  Amounts  Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries
of Aggregate Amounts Due shall  be  shared  by all Lenders in proportion to the
Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided, if all or part of such proportionately
greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from
such  Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization  of  Company  or  otherwise,
those purchases  shall  be  rescinded  and  the  purchase  prices paid for such
participations  shall  be  returned  to such purchasing Lender ratably  to  the
extent of such recovery, but without interest.   Company  expressly consents to
the  foregoing  arrangement  and  agrees that any holder of a participation  so
purchased  may  exercise  any and all  rights  of  banker's  lien,  set-off  or
counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by Company to that holder
with respect thereto as fully  as  if  that  holder were owed the amount of the
participation held by that holder.

 2.19. MAKING OR MAINTAINING EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

             (a)    Inability to Determine Applicable  Interest  Rate.   In the
event  that  Administrative  Agent  shall  have determined (which determination
shall  be  final  and conclusive and binding upon  all  parties  hereto  absent
manifest error), on  any  Interest  Rate Determination Date with respect to any
Eurodollar Rate Loans, that by reason  of  circumstances  affecting  the London
interbank  market  adequate  and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
the interest rate applicable to  such  Loans  on  the basis provided for in the
definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, Administrative Agent shall on such date
give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed  in writing) to Company
and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans  may  be made as,
or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative  Agent
notifies  Company and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice
no longer exist,  and (ii) any Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice
given  by  Company  with  respect  to  the  Loans  in  respect  of  which  such
determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by Company.

             (b)    Illegality  or  Impracticability  of Eurodollar Rate Loans.
In  the  event  that  on  any  date  any  Lender  shall have determined  (which
determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
but  shall  be  made  only after consultation with Company  and  Administrative
Agent) that the making,  maintaining  or  continuation  of  its Eurodollar Rate
Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such  Lender in good
faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline  or  order
(or  would  conflict  with  any  such  treaty,  governmental  rule, regulation,
guideline  or  order  not  having the force of law even though the  failure  to
comply therewith would not be unlawful), or (ii) has become impracticable, as a
result of contingencies occurring  after  the  date hereof which materially and
adversely affect the London interbank market or  the position of such Lender in
that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender  shall  be  an  "AFFECTED
LENDER"  and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone
confirmed in writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such determination
(which notice  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  transmit  to  each other
Lender).   Thereafter  (1) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make  Loans
as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such
notice shall be withdrawn  by  the  Affected  Lender,  (2)  to  the extent such
determination  by  the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate  Loan  then
being   requested   by  Company   pursuant   to   a   Funding   Notice   or   a
Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or
continue such Loan as  or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate
Loan,  (3)  the  Affected  Lender's  obligation  to  maintain  its  outstanding
Eurodollar Rate Loans (the "AFFECTED LOANS") shall be terminated at the earlier
to occur of the expiration of  the  Interest Period then in effect with respect
to the Affected Loans or when required by law, and (4) the Affected Loans shall
automatically convert into Base Rate  Loans  on  the  date of such termination.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, to the extent a determination  by  an  Affected
Lender as described  above  relates  to  a  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  then  being
requested  by Company pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation

                                    64

<PAGE>
Notice, Company  shall  have  the  option, subject to the provisions of Section
2.19(c), to rescind such Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice as to
all Lenders by giving notice (by telefacsimile  or  by  telephone  confirmed in
writing)  to  Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which  the
Affected Lender  gives  notice  of  its determination as described above (which
notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other
Lender).  Except as provided in the immediately  preceding sentence, nothing in
this Section 2.19(b) shall affect the obligation of  any  Lender  other than an
Affected  Lender  to  make  or  maintain  Loans  as,  or  to  convert Loans to,
Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with the terms hereof.

             (c)    Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement  of  Interest
Periods.   Company  shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by  such
Lender (which request  shall  set forth the basis for requesting such amounts),
for all reasonable losses, expenses  and  liabilities  (including  any interest
paid  by  such  Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry  its
Eurodollar Rate Loans  and  any  loss,  expense  or liability sustained by such
Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment  of  such  funds but
excluding  loss  of  anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if
for any reason (other  than  a  default  by  such  Lender)  a  borrowing of any
Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor  in  a Funding
Notice   or  a  telephonic  request  for  borrowing,  or  a  conversion  to  or
continuation  of  any  Eurodollar  Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified
therefor  in a Conversion/Continuation  Notice  or  a  telephonic  request  for
conversion  or  continuation; (ii) if any prepayment or other principal payment
or any conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a date prior to
the last day of an  Interest Period applicable to that Loan (including, without
limitation, pursuant  to  Section 2.14 hereof); or (iii) if  any  prepayment of
any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on  any date specified in a notice
of prepayment given by Company.

             (d)    Booking of Eurodollar Rate  Loans.   Any  Lender  may make,
carry  or  transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the account of any  of
its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of such Lender.

             (e)    Assumptions  Concerning  Funding  of Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Calculation  of  all  amounts payable to a Lender under this  Section 2.19  and
under Section 2.20 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded each
of its relevant Eurodollar  Rate  Loans  through  the  purchase of a Eurodollar
deposit  bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to  clause  (i) of  the
definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such
Eurodollar  Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest
Period and through  the  transfer  of  such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore
office of such Lender to a domestic office  of such Lender in the United States
of America; provided, however, each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Rate
Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized
only for the purposes of calculating amounts  payable  under  this Section 2.19
and under Section 2.20.

                                    65

       2.20. INCREASED COSTS; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

             (a)    Compensation For Increased Costs and Taxes.  Subject to the
provisions  of  Section 2.21,  in the event that any Lender (which  term  shall
include Issuing Bank for purposes  of  this  Section  2.20(a))  shall determine
(which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive  and
binding  upon  all  parties  hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation  or  order,  or  any  change   therein  or  in  the  interpretation,
administration or application thereof (including  the  introduction  of any new
law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of
a  court  or governmental authority, in each case that becomes effective  after
the date hereof,  or  compliance  by such Lender with any guideline, request or
directive issued or made after the  date  hereof  by  any central bank or other
governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or  not  having the force
of  law):  (i) subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office)  to  any
additional Tax  (other than any Excluded Tax) with respect to this Agreement or
any of the other  Credit  Documents  or  any  of  its  obligations hereunder or
thereunder or any payments to such Lender (or its applicable lending office) of
principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder;  (ii) imposes,
modifies  or  holds  applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency,
supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC
insurance or similar requirement  against  assets held by, or deposits or other
liabilities in or for the account of, or advances  or loans by, or other credit
extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any  office  of  such Lender
(other  than  any such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar
Rate Loans that  are  reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate);
or (iii) imposes any other  condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter)
on  or  affecting  such  Lender (or  its  applicable  lending  office)  or  its
obligations hereunder or the  London interbank market; and the result of any of
the foregoing is to increase the  cost  to  such  Lender  of  agreeing to make,
making  or  maintaining  Loans  hereunder  or to reduce any amount received  or
receivable  by  such Lender (or its applicable  lending  office)  with  respect
thereto; then, in  any  such  case,  Company shall promptly pay to such Lender,
upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional
amount or amounts (in the form of an increased  rate  of, or a different method
of  calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in  its  sole  discretion
shall  determine)  as  may  be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such
increased cost or reduction in  amounts received or receivable hereunder.  Such
Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written
statement, setting forth in reasonable  detail  the  basis  for calculating the
additional  amounts  owed  to  such  Lender  under this Section 2.20(a),  which
statement  shall  be  conclusive and binding upon  all  parties  hereto  absent
manifest error.

             (b)    Capital  Adequacy Adjustment.  In the event that any Lender
shall  have  determined  that  the   adoption,   effectiveness,   phase-in   or
applicability  after  the  Closing  Date of any law, rule or regulation (or any
provision thereof) regarding capital  adequacy, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with  the  interpretation  or  administration
thereof,  or  compliance by any Lender (or its applicable lending office)  with
any guideline,  request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not

                                    66

<PAGE>
having the force  of  law)  of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would  have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on the capital of such Lender or any  corporation  controlling such Lender as a
consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender's  Loans  or  Commitments  or
Letters  of  Credit,  or  participations therein or other obligations hereunder
with respect to the Loans or  the Letters of Credit to a level below that which
such Lender or such controlling  corporation  could  have achieved but for such
adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change  or compliance (taking
into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling  corporation
with regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within five  Business
Days after receipt by Company from such Lender of the statement referred  to in
the  next sentence, Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount  or
amounts  as  will  compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an
after-tax basis for  such reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with
a  copy  to  Administrative  Agent)  a  written  statement,  setting  forth  in
reasonable detail  the  basis  for  calculating  the additional amounts owed to
Lender  under this Section 2.20(b), which statement  shall  be  conclusive  and
binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

       2.21. TAXES; WITHHOLDING, ETC.

             (a)    Payments  to  Be  Free  and Clear.  All sums payable by any
Credit Party hereunder and under the other Credit  Documents  shall  (except to
the  extent  required  by  law)  be  paid  free  and  clear of, and without any
deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax (other  than  any Excluded Tax)
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States
of America or any political subdivision in or of the United States  of  America
or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made by or on behalf of
any  Credit  Party  or  by  any  federation or organization of which the United
States of America or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment.

             (b)    Withholding of  Taxes.   If  any  Credit Party or any other
Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding  on  account  of
any  Tax  from  any  sum  paid or payable by any Credit Party to Administrative
Agent or any Lender under any of the Credit Documents: (i) Company shall notify
Administrative  Agent of any  such  requirement  or  any  change  in  any  such
requirement as soon  as Company becomes aware of it; (ii) Company shall pay any
such Tax before the date  on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be
made (if the liability to pay  is  imposed  on  any  Credit  Party) for its own
account  or  (if  that  liability  is imposed on Administrative Agent  or  such
Lender, as the case may be) on behalf  of  and  in  the  name of Administrative
Agent or such Lender; (iii) except with respect to any Excluded  Tax,  the  sum
payable  by  such  Credit  Party  in  respect  of which the relevant deduction,
withholding or payment is required shall be increased  to  the extent necessary
to  ensure  that, after the making of that deduction, withholding  or  payment,
Administrative  Agent  or  such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due
date a net sum equal to what  it  would  have  received  had no such deduction,
withholding or payment been required or made; and (iv) within thirty days after
paying  any  sum  from  which  it is required by law to make any  deduction  or
withholding, and within thirty days  after  the  due date of payment of any Tax

                                    67
<PAGE>

which  it is required by clause (ii) above to pay,  Company  shall  deliver  to
Administrative  Agent  evidence  satisfactory  to the other affected parties of
such deduction, withholding or payment and of the  remittance  thereof  to  the
relevant  taxing  or  other  authority,  provided,  however, that no additional
amount  shall  be  required to be paid to any Lender under  clause (iii)  above
except to the extent  that  any  change  after the Lender Effective Date in any
such  requirement  for a deduction, withholding  or  payment  as  is  mentioned
therein shall result  in an increase in the rate of such deduction, withholding
or payment from that in  effect  at  the  Lender  Effective  Date in respect of
payments to such Lender.

             (c)    Evidence of Exemption From U.S. Withholding Tax.  Except to
the extent such deliveries have already been made by any Lender pursuant to the
Original  Agreement  or  the  Existing Agreement and such previously  delivered
forms continue to be accurate,  (i) each  Lender  that  is  not a United States
Person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the  Internal Revenue
Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "NON-US LENDER") shall deliver to
Administrative Agent for transmission to Company, on or prior to  the Effective
Date  (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof  on  the
Effective Date) or on or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant
to which  it  becomes  a  Lender  (in  the  case  of  each  other Lender), upon
designation  of  a  new  lending  office,  and at such other times  as  may  be
necessary in the determination of Company or  Administrative Agent (each in the
reasonable exercise of its discretion), two original copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor  forms), properly completed and
duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation  required  under the
Internal   Revenue   Code,  or  regulations  or  administrative  pronouncements
promulgated thereunder,  and  reasonably requested by Company to establish that
such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax with respect to any  payments to such Lender of principal, interest,
fees or other amounts payable under  any  of  the  Credit  Documents; (ii) each
Lender  that  is  a  United States Person (as such term is defined  in  Section
7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
and that is not a person  which  the Company is entitled to treat as an "exempt
recipient" (as such term is defined  in  Section 1.6049-4(c)(ii)  of the United
States  Treasury Regulations) without receiving a certificate from such  person
(under current  law,  including,  but  not  limited  to  any  person whose name
includes  the  terms  "Incorporated",  "Inc.", "Corporation", "Corp.",  "P.C.",
"insurance  company", "indemnity company",  "reinsurance  company",  "assurance
company",  "bank",   "savings   and  loan  association",  "buildings  and  loan
association",  "homestead association",  "credit  union"  or  "industrial  loan
association" and  their  permitted foreign language equivalents, and any entity
that is generally known in  the  investment  community  to be registered at all
times during the taxable year under the Investment Company  Act of 1940) (a "US
Lender")  shall  deliver  to the Administrative Agent for transmission  to  the
Company, on or prior to the  Effective  Date  (in  the  case  of each US Lender
listed on the signature pages hereof, on the Effective Date) or  on or prior to
the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes  a  US Lender
(in  the  case  of  each  other  US  Lender), and at such other times as may be
necessary in the determination of the  Company or Administrative Agent (each in
the reasonable exercise of its discretion),  two  original  copies  of Internal

                                    68

<PAGE>
Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor forms), properly completed  and duly
executed  by  such US Lender, and such other documentation reasonably requested
by the Company, to establish that such US Lender is not subject to deduction or
withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to
such US Lender  of principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under any
of the Credit Documents;  or  (iii) if  such  Lender  is  not a "bank" or other
Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue  Code  and cannot
deliver  either  Internal  Revenue  Service  Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI pursuant  to
clause (i) above, a Certificate re Non-Bank Status  together  with two original
copies  of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or any successor form),  properly
completed  and  duly  executed  by  such  Lender,  and such other documentation
reasonably requested by Company or Administrative Agent  to establish that such
Lender  is  not  subject to deduction or withholding of United  States  federal
income tax with respect  to  any  payments  to  such Lender of interest payable
under any of the Credit Documents.  Each Lender required  to deliver any forms,
certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal income tax
withholding matters pursuant to this Section 2.21(c) hereby  agrees,  from time
to  time  after  the  initial  time  for delivery or potential delivery by such
Lender of such forms, certificates or  other evidence, whenever a lapse in time
or change in circumstances renders such  forms,  certificates or other evidence
obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall promptly
deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to  Company  two  new original
copies  of  Internal  Revenue  Service  Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor
forms), or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status  (or  any  successor forms) and two
original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or  two original copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, as the case may be (or any successor forms),
properly   completed  and  duly  executed  by  such  Lender,  and  such   other
documentation  reasonably  requested  by  Company  or  Administrative  Agent to
confirm  or  establish  that  such  Lender  is  not  subject  to  deduction  or
withholding  of  United  States  federal income tax with respect to payments to
such Lender under the Credit Documents,  or  notify  Administrative  Agent  and
Company  of  its  inability  to  deliver  any such forms, certificates or other
evidence.  Company shall not be required to  pay  any  additional amount to any
U.S. Lender or Non-US Lender under Section 2.21(b)(iii) if  such  Lender  shall
have  failed  (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence referred
to  in  the  second   sentence   of  this  Section 2.21(c),  or  (2) to  notify
Administrative Agent and Company of  its  inability  to deliver any such forms,
certificates or other evidence, as the case may be; provided,  if  such  Lender
shall   have   satisfied  the  requirements  of  the  first  sentence  of  this
Section 2.21(c)  on  the  Effective  Date  or  on  the  date  of the Assignment
Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender, as applicable,  nothing in this
last sentence of Section 2.21(c) shall relieve Company of its obligation to pay
any  additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.20(a) or Section 2.21(b)  in  the
event  that,  as  a  result  of  any  change  in  any applicable law, treaty or
governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change  in  the  interpretation,
administration  or  application  thereof,  such  Lender  is  no longer properly
entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a  subsequent date
establishing  the  fact  that  such  Lender  is  not subject to withholding  as
described herein.  Each US Lender and Non-US Lender  hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Company from and against any Taxes  imposed  on or behalf
of  the  United  States  or  any taxing jurisdiction thereof, and any interest,
penalties or additions thereto,  or  costs  incurred  in  connection therewith,

                                    69
<PAGE>

incurred or payable by the Company as a result of the failure of the Company to
comply with its obligations to deduct or withhold any Taxes  imposed  by  or on
behalf  of  the  United  States  or  any  taxing  jurisdiction thereof from any
payments made pursuant to this Agreement to such US  Lender,  Non-US  Lender or
the Administrative Agent, which failure resulted from the Company's reliance on
any  form,  statement, certificate or other information provided to it by  such
Lender pursuant  to  this  Section 2.21  or  by  reason  of such Lender being a
"conduit entity" within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.881-3
(or any applicable successor provision).

       2.22. OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE.  Each Lender agrees that,  as  promptly as
practicable after the officer of such Lender responsible for administering  its
Commitments,  Loans  or Letters of Credit, as the case may be, becomes aware of
the occurrence of an event  or  the  existence  of a condition that would cause
such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that  would  entitle such Lender to
receive payments under Section 2.19, 2.20 or 2.21, it will,  to  the extent not
inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal
or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue,  fund or
maintain  its  Commitments, Loans and Letters of Credit, including any Affected
Loans, through another  office  of such Lender, or (b) take such other measures
as such Lender may deem reasonable,  if  as  a result thereof the circumstances
which would cause such Lender to be an Affected  Lender would cease to exist or
the additional amounts which would otherwise be required  to  be  paid  to such
Lender  pursuant to Section 2.19, 2.20 or 2.21 would be materially reduced  and
if, as determined  by  such Lender in its sole discretion, the making, issuing,
funding or maintaining of  such Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit through
such other office or in accordance  with  such  other measures, as the case may
be, would not otherwise adversely affect such Commitments,  Loans or Letters of
Credit  or  the  interests of such Lender; provided, such Lender  will  not  be
obligated to utilize  such  other  office  pursuant to this Section 2.22 unless
Company agrees to pay all incremental expenses  incurred  by  such  Lender as a
result  of  utilizing  such  other office as described in clause (a) above.   A
certificate as to the amount of  any  such expenses payable by Company pursuant
to  this  Section 2.22  (setting  forth in  reasonable  detail  the  basis  for
requesting such amount) submitted by  such  Lender  to  Company (with a copy to
Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

       2.23. DEFAULTING  LENDERS.  Anything contained herein  to  the  contrary
notwithstanding, in the event  that  any Lender, at the direction or request of
any regulatory agency or authority, defaults  (a  "DEFAULTING  LENDER")  in its
obligation  to  fund  (a  "FUNDING  DEFAULT")  any Revolving Loan under Section
2.3(b)(iv) or its portion of any unreimbursed payment  under Section 2.4(e) (in
each case, a "DEFAULTED LOAN"), then (a) during any Default Period with respect
to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall  be  deemed not to be a
"Lender" for purposes of voting on any matters (including the  granting  of any
consents  or  waivers)  with respect to any of the Credit Documents; (b) to the
extent permitted by applicable  law, until such time as the Default Excess with
respect to such Defaulting Lender  shall  have  been  reduced  to zero, (i) any
voluntary prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall, if Company so directs at the

                                    70
<PAGE>

time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Revolving  Loans of
other  Lenders  as if such Defaulting Lender had no Revolving Loans outstanding
and the Revolving  Exposure  of  such Defaulting Lender were zero, and (ii) any
mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall, if Company so directs at the
time of making such mandatory prepayment,  be applied to the Revolving Loans of
other Lenders (but not to the Revolving Loans  of such Defaulting Lender) as if
such  Defaulting  Lender  had funded all Defaulted  Loans  of  such  Defaulting
Lender, it being understood and agreed that Company shall be entitled to retain
any portion of any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans that is not paid
to such Defaulting Lender solely as a result of the operation of the provisions
of  this clause (b); (c) such  Defaulting  Lender's  Revolving  Commitment  and
outstanding  Revolving Loans and such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Letter of Credit  Usage  shall  be  excluded  for  purposes  of calculating the
Revolving Commitment fee payable to Lenders in respect of any  day  during  any
Default  Period  with  respect  to  such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting
Lender shall not be entitled to receive  any  Revolving Commitment fee pursuant
to Section 2.11 with respect to such Defaulting  Lender's  Revolving Commitment
in  respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting  Lender;  and
(d) the   Total  Utilization  of  Revolving  Commitments  as  at  any  date  of
determination  shall  be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all
Defaulted Loans of such  Defaulting  Lender.   No  Revolving  Commitment of any
Lender  shall  be  increased  or  otherwise affected, and, except as  otherwise
expressly  provided  in  this  Section 2.23,  performance  by  Company  of  its
obligations hereunder and the other  Credit  Documents  shall not be excused or
otherwise modified as a result of any Funding Default or  the operation of this
Section 2.23.  The rights and remedies against a Defaulting  Lender  under this
Section 2.23  are  in  addition to other rights and remedies which Company  may
have against such Defaulting  Lender  with  respect  to any Funding Default and
which  Administrative  Agent  or  any Lender may have against  such  Defaulting
Lender with respect to any Funding Default.

       2.24. REMOVAL OR REPLACEMENT  OF A LENDER.  Anything contained herein to
the  contrary  notwithstanding,  in  the  event   that:   (a)  any  Lender  (an
"INCREASED-COST LENDER") shall give notice to Company that  such  Lender  is an
Affected  Lender  or  such  Lender  becomes  entitled to receive payments under
Section 2.20 or 2.21, the circumstances which  have caused such Lender to be an
Affected Lender or which entitle such Lender to  receive  such  payments  shall
remain  in  effect,  and  such Lender shall fail to (i) withdraw such notice or
(ii) waive in writing the right  to receive the applicable payments, in each of
cases (i) and (ii), within five Business  Days after Company's request for such
withdrawal or waiver; or (b) any Lender shall  become  a Defaulting Lender, the
Default  Period  for such Defaulting Lender shall remain in  effect,  and  such
Defaulting Lender  shall  fail  to cure the default as a result of which it has
become a Defaulting Lender within  five  Business  Days after Company's request
that it cure such default; or (c) in connection with  any  proposed  amendment,
modification,  termination,  waiver  or  consent  with  respect  to  any of the
provisions  hereof as contemplated by Section 10.5(b), the consent of Requisite
Lenders shall  have  been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other
Lenders (each a "NON-CONSENTING  LENDER")  whose  consent is required shall not
have  been  obtained;  then, with respect to each such  Increased-Cost  Lender,

                                    71
<PAGE>

Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting  Lender  (the "TERMINATED LENDER"), Company
may, by giving written notice to Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender
of  its  election to do so, elect to cause such  Terminated  Lender  (and  such
Terminated  Lender  hereby  irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans
and its Revolving Commitments,  if  any,  in  full  to  one  or  more  Eligible
Assignees  (each  a "REPLACEMENT LENDER") in accordance with the provisions  of
Section 10.6 and Terminated  Lender  shall  pay  any fees payable thereunder in
connection with such assignment; provided, (1) on  the date of such assignment,
the Replacement Lender shall pay to Terminated Lender  an  amount  equal to the
sum  of  (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest  on,
all outstanding  Loans  of  the  Terminated  Lender, (B) an amount equal to all
unreimbursed drawings that have been funded by such Terminated Lender, together
with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto  at  such  time  and  (C) an
amount  equal  to  all  accrued,  but  theretofore  unpaid  fees  owing to such
Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.12; (2) on the date of such assignment,
Company  shall  pay  any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant  to
Section 2.19, 2.20 or  2.21 or otherwise as if it were a prepayment; and (3) in
the event such Terminated  Lender  is a Non-Consenting Lender, each Replacement
Lender shall consent, at the time of such assignment, to each matter in respect
of which such Terminated Lender was  a Non-Consenting Lender; provided, Company
may not make such election with respect  to  any Terminated Lender that is also
an Issuing Bank unless, prior to the effectiveness  of  such  election, Company
shall  have  caused  each  outstanding  Letter of Credit issued thereby  to  be
cancelled.  Upon the prepayment of all amounts  owing  to any Terminated Lender
and the termination of such Terminated Lender's Revolving  Commitments, if any,
such  Terminated  Lender  shall  no longer constitute a "Lender"  for  purposes
hereof;  provided,  any rights of such  Terminated  Lender  to  indemnification
hereunder shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

SECTION 4.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

             In order to induce Lenders and Issuing  Bank  to  enter  into this
Agreement  and  to  make  each Credit Extension to be made thereby, each Credit
Party represents and warrants to each Lender and Issuing Bank, on the Effective
Date and on each Credit Date,  that  the  following  statements  are  true  and
correct,  except  to  the  extent  any  representation or warranty relates to a
specific date, in which case such statement  shall  be  true  and correct as of
such specific date.

       4.1.  ORGANIZATION; REQUISITE POWER AND AUTHORITY; QUALIFICATION.   Each
of Holdings and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in
good  standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization as identified
in Schedule 4.1,  (b)  has all requisite power and authority to own and operate
its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be

business  and  in  good  standing  in  every  jurisdiction where its assets are

Effect.

       4.2.  CAPITAL  STOCK AND  OWNERSHIP.   The  Capital  Stock  of  each  of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries  has  been duly authorized and validly issued and
is fully paid and non-assessable.  Except  as  set forth on Schedule 4.2, as of
the date hereof, there is no existing option, warrant,  call, right, commitment
or  other  agreement to which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries  is  a  party
requiring, and there is no Capital Stock of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
outstanding  which  upon  conversion or exchange would require, the issuance by
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries of any additional Capital Stock of Holdings
or any of its Subsidiaries  or  other Securities convertible into, exchangeable
for or evidencing the right to subscribe  for  or  purchase,  Capital  Stock of
Holdings  or  any  of its Subsidiaries.  Schedule 4.2 correctly sets forth  the
ownership interest of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries in their respective
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date.

       4.3.  DUE AUTHORIZATION.   The  transactions  contemplated by the Credit
Documents  are  within  the  corporate  powers  of each Credit  Party  and  the

of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do  not  and  will not
(a)  violate  any  provision  of any law or any governmental rule or regulation
applicable to Holdings or any of  its  Subsidiaries,  any of the Organizational
Documents  of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, or any  order,  judgment  or
decree of any court or other agency of government binding on Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries  except  to  the extent such violation, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably  be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
(b) conflict with, result in a breach  of  or  constitute  (with  due notice or
lapse  of time or both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of  Holdings
or any of  its  Subsidiaries  except  to  the  extent  such conflict, breach or
default, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably  be expected to
have  a  Material  Adverse  Effect;  (c) result  in or require the creation  or
imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties  or assets of Holdings or any
of  its  Subsidiaries (other than any Liens created under  any  of  the  Credit
Documents  in  favor of Collateral  Agent, on behalf of Secured Parties) except
to the extent that  the  creation or imposition of any such Liens, individually
or in the aggregate, could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  have  a Material
Adverse  Effect;  or  (d) require  any  approval  of  stockholders,  members or
partners  or  any  approval  or  consent  of  any  Person under any Contractual
Obligation of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or
consents which will be obtained on or before the Effective  Date  and disclosed
in writing to Lenders and except for any such approvals or consents the failure
of  which to obtain, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

       4.6.  GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS.  The execution, delivery and performance by
Credit  Parties  of  the  Credit  Documents  to  which they are parties and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the  Credit  Documents  do not
and  will  not require any registration with, consent or approval of, or notice
to, or other action to, with or by, any Governmental Authority, except for such
registrations,  consents, approvals, notices or actions the failure of which to
obtain, individually  or  in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

       4.7.  BINDING OBLIGATION.   Each  Credit Document has been duly executed
and delivered by each Credit Party that is  a  party thereto and is the legally
valid  and binding obligation of such Credit Party,  enforceable  against  such
Credit Party  in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited
by bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating
to or limiting creditors'  rights generally or by equitable principles relating
to enforceability.

       4.8.  HISTORICAL  FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS.    The   Historical  Financial

<PAGE>

Persons  described  in  such financial statements as at  the  respective  dates
thereof and the results of  operations and cash flows, on a consolidated basis,
of the entities described therein  for each of the periods then ended, subject,
in the case of any such unaudited financial  statements,  to  changes resulting
from audit and normal year-end adjustments.  As of the Effective  Date, neither
Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries has any contingent liability or  liability
for  taxes, long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that  is
not reflected  in  the Historical Financial Statements or the notes thereto and
which in any such case  is  material  in  relation to the business, operations,
properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Holdings
and any of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

       4.9.  PROJECTIONS.  On and as of the  Effective Date, the Projections of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries for the period beginning  with  Fiscal  Year 2003
through  and  including Fiscal Year 2010 (the "PROJECTIONS") are based on  good
faith estimates  and reasonable assumptions made by the management of Holdings;
provided, the Projections are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results
during the period  or  periods  covered by the Projections may differ from such
Projections and that the differences  may  be material; provided further, as of
the Effective Date, management of Holdings believed  that  the Projections were
reasonable and attainable.

       4.10. NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.  Since December 27,  2003,  no  event,
circumstance or change has occurred that has caused or evidences, either in any
case or in the aggregate, a continuing Material Adverse Effect.

       4.11. ADVERSE  PROCEEDINGS,  ETC.   There  are  no  Adverse Proceedings,
individually or in the aggregate, that could reasonably be expected  to  have a
Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries (a) is
in  violation of any  applicable  laws  (including  Environmental  Laws)  that,
individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  could  reasonably  be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (b) is subject to or in default with respect to any
final judgments, writs, injunctions, decrees, rules or regulations of any court
or any federal, state, municipal or other governmental department,  commission,
board,   bureau,   agency   or  instrumentality,  domestic  or  foreign,  that,
individually or in the aggregate,  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  have  a
Material Adverse Effect.

       4.12. PAYMENT  OF  TAXES.   Except  as otherwise permitted under Section
5.3,  all material tax returns and reports of  Holdings  and  its  Subsidiaries
required to be filed by any of them have been timely filed, and all taxes shown
on such  tax  returns  to be due and payable and all material assessments, fees
and other governmental charges  upon  Holdings  and  its  Subsidiaries and upon
their  respective properties, assets, income, businesses and  franchises  which
are due  and payable have been paid when due and payable.  Holdings knows of no
proposed tax  assessment  against  Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries which is
not being actively contested by Holdings  or  such Subsidiary in good faith and
by  appropriate  proceedings;  provided,  such reserves  or  other  appropriate
provisions, if any, as shall be required in  conformity  with  GAAP  shall have
been made or provided therefor.

                                    83

<PAGE>
       4.13. PROPERTIES.

             (a)    Title.  Each of Holdings and its Subsidiaries has (i) good,
sufficient  and legal title to (in the case of fee interests in real property),
(ii) valid leasehold  interests  in (in the case of leasehold interests in real
or personal property), and (iii) good  title  to  (in  the  case  of  all other
personal property), all of their respective properties and assets reflected  in
their respective Historical Financial Statements referred to in Section 4.8 and
in  the  most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.1, in
each case  except  for  assets  disposed  of  since  the date of such financial
statements in the ordinary course of business of Company  and  its Subsidiaries
or  as  otherwise  permitted  under Section 6.9.  Except as permitted  by  this
Agreement, all such properties and assets are free and clear of Liens.

             (b)    Real Estate.   As  of  the  Effective  Date,  Schedule 4.13
contains a true, accurate and complete list of (i) all Real Estate  Assets, and
(ii) all  leases,  subleases  or  assignments  of  leases  (together  with  all
amendments,  modifications, supplements, renewals or extensions of any thereof)
affecting each  Real  Estate  Asset  of any Credit Party, regardless of whether
such Credit Party is the landlord or tenant (whether directly or as an assignee
or  successor  in interest) under such lease,  sublease  or  assignment.   Each
agreement listed  in  clause  (ii) of  the immediately preceding sentence is in
full force and effect and Holdings does  not have knowledge of any default that
has occurred and is continuing thereunder,  and each such agreement constitutes
the  legally  valid  and binding obligation of each  applicable  Credit  Party,
enforceable against such  Credit  Party in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement   may  be  limited  by  bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization,
moratorium or similar  laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally
or by equitable principles.

       4.14. ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS.   Except  as  set  forth on Schedule 4.14,
(i) neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any  of  their  respective
Facilities or operations are subject to any outstanding written order,  consent
decree  or  settlement  agreement with any Person relating to any Environmental
Law, any Environmental Claim,  or  any Hazardous Materials Activity, (ii) there
are and, to each of Holdings' and its  Subsidiaries'  knowledge,  have been, no
conditions,   occurrences,   or  Hazardous  Materials  Activities  which  could
reasonably be expected to form  the  basis  of  an  Environmental Claim against
Holdings  or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) neither Holdings  nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  has  received any letter or request for information under Section
104 of the Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation, and Liability
Act (42 U.S.C. {section} 9604) or any comparable state  law,  in  each of cases
(i),  (ii)  and  (iii)  that,  if  resolved  adversely, individually or in  the
aggregate,  could reasonably be expected to have  a  Material  Adverse  Effect.
Compliance with  all  current  or  reasonably  foreseeable  future requirements
pursuant  to or under Environmental Laws could not reasonably  be  expected  to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.  No event or
condition has  occurred  or is occurring with respect to Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any  applicable  Environmental  Law,  any  Release  of
Hazardous  Materials, or any Hazardous Materials Activity which individually or

                                    84
<PAGE>

in the aggregate  has  had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect, other than the events and conditions described on Schedule 4.14
as existing on or prior to the Effective Date.

       4.15. NO DEFAULTS.   Neither  Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default  in  the  performance,  observance   or   fulfillment  of  any  of  the
obligations,  covenants  or  conditions  contained in any  of  its  Contractual
Obligations, and no condition exists which,  with  the  giving of notice or the
lapse  of  time  or  both,  could constitute such a default, except  where  the
consequences, direct or indirect,  of  such  default or defaults, if any, could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

       4.16. GOVERNMENTAL  REGULATION.   Neither   Holdings   nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the Public Utility  Holding Company
Act  of 1935, the Federal Power Act or the Investment Company Act  of  1940  or
under  any  other  federal  or  state statute or regulation which may limit its
ability to incur Indebtedness or  which may otherwise render all or any portion
of the Obligations unenforceable.  Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a "registered investment company" or a company "controlled" by a "registered
investment company" or a "principal  underwriter"  of  a "registered investment
company" as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.

       4.17. MARGIN  STOCK.  Neither Holdings nor any of  its  Subsidiaries  is
engaged principally, or  as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose  of  purchasing  or carrying any Margin Stock.
No part of the proceeds of the Loans made to such Credit  Party will be used to
purchase or carry any such margin stock or to extend credit  to  others for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any such margin stock or for any purpose that
violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation T,  U  or  X of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

pending against Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or to the best knowledge
of  Holdings and Company, threatened against any of them  before  the  National
Labor Relations Board and no grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of
or under  any  collective  bargaining  agreement  that  is  so  pending against
Holdings  or  any of its Subsidiaries or to the best knowledge of Holdings  and
Company, threatened  against  any  of  them,  (b) no strike or work stoppage in
existence or threatened involving Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries,  and (c)

aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect,

warranty is made and after giving effect to the provisions of Section 7.2, will

engaged  in  similar  businesses.  Each such policy of insurance shall (i) name
Administrative Agent, on  behalf of Lenders as an additional insured thereunder
as its interests may appear  and  (ii) in  the  case of each casualty insurance
policy, contain a loss payable clause or endorsement,  satisfactory in form and
substance to Administrative Agent, that names Administrative  Agent,  on behalf
of  Lenders  as  the  loss  payee thereunder and provides for at least 30 days'
prior  written  notice  to  Administrative   Agent   of   any  modification  or
cancellation of such policy.

       5.6.  INSPECTIONS.  Each Credit Party will, and will  cause  each of its
Subsidiaries to, permit any authorized representatives designated by  any Agent
or  Lender  to visit and inspect any of the properties of any Credit Party  and

accounts with its and their officers and independent  public  accountants,  all

hours  and  as  often  as may reasonably  be  requested.   If  such  visit  and
inspection occurs at a time  when  no  Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, such visit and inspection  shall  be  at the expense of such

                                    91
<PAGE>

Lender  and,  if such visit and inspection occur at a time when  a  Default  or
Event of Default  has  occurred  and  is  continuing, such visit and inspection
shall be paid by Company pursuant to Section  10.2.   By  this  provision, each
Credit  Party  authorizes  its  independent  public accountants to discuss  the

in any such discussion.

       5.7.  LENDERS MEETINGS.   Holdings and Company will, upon the request of
Administrative  Agent  or  Requisite  Lenders,  participate  in  a  meeting  of

Company and Administrative Agent) at such time as may be agreed  to  by Company
and Administrative Agent.

       5.8.  COMPLIANCE  WITH  LAWS.  Each Credit Party will comply, and  shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and  all  other Persons, if any, on or occupying
any Facilities to comply, with the requirements  of all applicable laws, rules,

                    (i)   with  respect  to any period during which a Permitted
       Acquisition   or  an  Asset  Sale  has  occurred   (each,   a   "SUBJECT
       TRANSACTION"),   each of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, the components of
       Consolidated Cash  Interest  Expense  and  Additional Net Sales shall be
       calculated with respect to such period on a  pro  forma basis (including
       only  Permitted  Adjustments)  using  the  historical audited  financial
       statements of any business so acquired or to  be  acquired or sold or to
       be sold and the consolidated financial statements of  Holdings  and  its
       Subsidiaries which shall be reformulated as if such Subject Transaction,
       and  any  Indebtedness  incurred  or repaid in connection therewith, had
       been consummated or incurred or repaid  at  the beginning of such period
       (and assuming that such Indebtedness bears interest  during  any portion
       of  the  applicable measurement period prior to the relevant acquisition
       at the weighted  average of the interest rates applicable to outstanding
       Loans incurred during such period);

                    (ii)  with  respect  to any period during which Company has

       integration  costs  or  Uncompleted  Acquisition   Costs,   Consolidated
       Adjusted EBITDA for such period shall be increased by an amount, without
       duplication,  equal  to  any such costs payable in Cash and incurred  by
       Company during such period  to  the  extent that such costs have reduced
       Consolidated Net Income for such period,  provided  that  the  aggregate
       amount  of adjustments to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA made pursuant  to
       this Section  6.8(d)(ii)  for  any  period,  together with any Permitted
       Adjustments  in  respect of any Subject Transactions  made  pursuant  to
       clause (ii) of the  definition  of  Permitted  Adjustments  for the same
       period, shall not exceed 7.5% of pro forma Consolidated Adjusted  EBITDA
       (as reformulated) for such period;

                    (iii) with  respect to any period during which the proceeds
       of  any capital contribution  to,  or  issuance  of  Capital  Stock  of,
       Holdings  ("EQUITY  PROCEEDS")  have  been  applied to make mandatory or
       voluntary prepayments of Loans, the components  of Consolidated Adjusted
       EBITDA and Consolidated Cash Interest Expense shall  be  calculated with
       respect  to such period on a pro forma basis (including only  pro  forma
       adjustments  which  are factually supportable and are expected to have a
       continuing impact, in  each  case  determined on a basis consistent with
       Article 11 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act and as
       interpreted  by  the staff of the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,
       which pro forma adjustments  shall  be  certified by the Chief Financial
       Officer of Holdings) using historical financial  statements  which shall
       be reformulated (after giving effect to any reformulation required under
       clause  (i)  above)  as  if such Equity Proceeds had been received,  and
       applicable portion of the  Loans  prepaid,  at  the  beginning  of  such
       period;

                    (iv)  with  respect  to  any  period  including  the Fiscal
       Quarter  ended  September 30, 2002 or any prior Fiscal Quarter (each  an

       Cash   Interest   Expense   shall   be  calculated  in  accordance  with
       Schedule 6.8(d); and

                    (v)   proceeds   of   the   Landis    Acquisition    Senior
       Subordinated  Notes  shall  not  be  included  in  the  determination of
       Consolidated Total Debt for purposes of determining compliance with this
       Section  6.8  for  periods  up  to  and including the Landis Acquisition
       Closing Date if all such proceeds (A) are deposited in an escrow account
       on the terms and conditions described  in the offering circular relating
       to the Landis Acquisition Senior Subordinated  Notes and (B)(1) are used
       to  pay  Landis  Acquisition  Financing  Requirements   on   the  Landis
       Acquisition  Closing  Date  or (2) used to prepay the Landis Acquisition

of  all  such  other Asset Sales made by Credit Parties pursuant to this clause
(iii) within the same Fiscal Year, are less than $10,000,000; provided, in each

SECTION 7.     GUARANTY

       7.1.  GUARANTY OF THE OBLIGATIONS.  Subject to the provisions of Section
7.2, Guarantors  jointly  and  severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantee to Administrative Agent  for the ratable benefit of the Beneficiaries
the due and punctual payment in full  of  all  Obligations  when the same shall
become  due,  whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment,  declaration,
acceleration, demand  or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but
for the operation of the  automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. {section} 362(a)) (collectively, the "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS").
Without limiting the obligations  of  Holdings  under  this Section 7, Holdings
shall become a co-obligor under the Notes, on a joint and  several  basis  with
Company, and execute the Notes in such capacity.

       7.2.  CONTRIBUTION  BY  GUARANTORS.   All  Guarantors desire to allocate
among themselves (collectively, the "CONTRIBUTING GUARANTORS"),  in  a fair and
equitable  manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty.  Accordingly,
in the event  any payment or distribution is made on any date by a Guarantor (a
"FUNDING GUARANTOR") under this Guaranty that exceeds its Fair Share as of such
date, such Funding  Guarantor  shall be entitled to a contribution from each of
the other Contributing Guarantors  in  the  amount  of  such other Contributing
Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall as of such date, with the result that all such
contributions  will cause each Contributing Guarantor's Aggregate  Payments  to
equal its Fair Share  as  of  such date.  "FAIR SHARE" means, with respect to a
Contributing Guarantor as of any  date  of  determination,  an  amount equal to
(a) the  ratio of (i) the Fair Share Contribution Amount with respect  to  such
Contributing  Guarantor  to  (ii) the  aggregate of the Fair Share Contribution
Amounts  with respect to all Contributing  Guarantors  multiplied  by  (b)  the
aggregate  amount  paid  or  distributed  on or before such date by all Funding
Guarantors under this Guaranty in respect of the obligations Guaranteed.  "FAIR
SHARE SHORTFALL" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date
of determination, the excess, if any, of the  Fair  Share  of such Contributing
Guarantor  over  the Aggregate Payments of such Contributing Guarantor.   "FAIR
SHARE CONTRIBUTION  AMOUNT"  means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as
of any date of determination,  the  maximum aggregate amount of the obligations
of such Contributing Guarantor under  this  Guaranty  that would not render its
obligations  hereunder  or  thereunder  subject to avoidance  as  a  fraudulent
transfer or conveyance under Section 548  of Title 11 of the United States Code
or any comparable applicable provisions of  state  law;  provided,  solely  for
purposes  of  calculating  the "FAIR SHARE CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT" with respect to
any Contributing Guarantor for  purposes  of  this  Section  7.2, any assets or
liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor arising by virtue of  any  rights to
subrogation,  reimbursement  or indemnification or any rights to or obligations

                                    112
<PAGE>

of contribution hereunder shall  not  be considered as assets or liabilities of
such Contributing Guarantor.  "AGGREGATE  PAYMENTS"  means,  with  respect to a
Contributing  Guarantor  as  of  any date of determination, an amount equal  to
(1) the aggregate amount of all payments  and  distributions  made on or before
such   date  by  such  Contributing  Guarantor  in  respect  of  this  Guaranty
(including,  without limitation, in respect of this Section 7.2), minus (2) the
aggregate amount  of  all  payments  received  on  or  before such date by such
Contributing Guarantor from the other Contributing Guarantors  as contributions
under  this Section 7.2.  The amounts payable as contributions hereunder  shall
be determined  as  of  the date on which the related payment or distribution is
made by the applicable Funding  Guarantor.   The  allocation among Contributing
Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this  Section  7.2 shall not be
construed  in  any  way  to  limit the liability of any Contributing  Guarantor
hereunder.  Each Guarantor is  a  third  party  beneficiary to the contribution
agreement set forth in this Section 7.2.

       7.3.  PAYMENT BY GUARANTORS.  Subject to Section  7.2, Guarantors hereby
jointly  and  severally  agree,  in  furtherance of the foregoing  and  not  in
limitation of any other right which any  Beneficiary  may  have  at  law  or in
equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of Company
to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall become due,
whether  at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration,
demand or  otherwise  (including  amounts  that  would  become  due but for the
operation  of  the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy  Code,
11 U.S.C.  {section} 362(a)),  Guarantors  will upon demand pay, or cause to be
paid,  in  Cash, in same day funds, to Administrative  Agent  for  the  ratable
benefit of Beneficiaries,  an  amount  equal to the sum of the unpaid principal
amount of all Guaranteed Obligations then  due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid
interest  on such Guaranteed Obligations (including  interest  which,  but  for
Company's becoming  the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, would have
accrued on such Guaranteed  Obligations,  whether  or  not  a  claim is allowed
against Company for such interest in the related bankruptcy case) and all other
Guaranteed Obligations then owed to Beneficiaries as aforesaid.

       7.4.  LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE.  Each Guarantor agrees  that its
obligations  hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional
and shall not  be  affected  by  any  circumstance which constitutes a legal or
equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety  other than payment in full of the
Guaranteed Obligations or the release of such Guarantor permitted by the Credit
Documents.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality
thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows:

             (a)    this Guaranty is a guaranty  of payment when due and not of
collectability.  This Guaranty is a primary obligation  of  each  Guarantor and
not merely a contract of surety;

             (b)    Administrative  Agent  may enforce this Guaranty  upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default notwithstanding  the existence of any dispute
between Company and any Beneficiary with respect to the existence of such Event
of Default;

                                    113
<PAGE>

             (c)    the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent
of  the  obligations  of  Company and the obligations of  any  other  guarantor
(including any other Guarantor)  of  the obligations of Company, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted  against such Guarantor whether
or not any action is brought against Company or any  of  such  other guarantors
and whether or not Company is joined in any such action or actions;

             (d)    payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not  all, of the
Guaranteed  Obligations  shall  in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge  any
Guarantor's liability for any portion  of  the Guaranteed Obligations which has
not  been  paid.   Without  limiting  the  generality   of  the  foregoing,  if
Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought  to  enforce any
Guarantor's  covenant  to  pay  a  portion of the Guaranteed Obligations,  such
judgment shall not be deemed to release such Guarantor from its covenant to pay
the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations that is not the subject of such suit,
and such judgment shall not, except  to the extent satisfied by such Guarantor,
limit, affect, modify or abridge any other  Guarantor's  liability hereunder in
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations;

             (e)    any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it  deems  appropriate,
without  notice  or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability
hereof or giving rise  to  any  reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or
termination of any Guarantor's liability  hereunder,  from  time  to  time  may
(i) renew,  extend,  accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise
change  the  time,  place,  manner  or  terms  of  payment  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse
any offer of performance  with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of
the same to the payment of  any  other  obligations;  (iii) request  and accept
other  guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold security  for
the payment  hereof  or  the  Guaranteed  Obligations; (iv) release, surrender,
exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or
modify,  with  or  without  consideration, any  security  for  payment  of  the
Guaranteed Obligations, any other  guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations, or
any other obligation of any Person (including any other Guarantor) with respect
to  the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce  and  apply  any  security  now  or
hereafter  held  by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary in respect hereof or
the Guaranteed Obligations  and  direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or
exercise any other right or remedy  that  such Beneficiary may have against any
such security, in each case as such Beneficiary in its discretion may determine
consistent  herewith  or  the  applicable Financial  Hedge  Agreement  and  any
applicable  security agreement, including  foreclosure  on  any  such  security
pursuant to one  or  more  judicial  or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every
aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such action
operates to impair or extinguish any right  of  reimbursement or subrogation or
other right or remedy of any Guarantor against Company  or any security for the
Guaranteed  Obligations;  and (vi) exercise any other rights  available  to  it
under the Credit Documents or the Financial Hedge Agreements; and

                                    114
<PAGE>
             (f)    this Guaranty  and  the obligations of Guarantors hereunder
shall be valid and enforceable and shall  not  be  subject  to  any  reduction,
limitation,  impairment,  discharge  or termination for any reason (other  than
payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations), including the occurrence of any
of  the  following,  whether or not any Guarantor  shall  have  had  notice  or
knowledge of any of them:  (i) any  failure or omission to assert or enforce or
agreement or election not to assert or  enforce,  or  the stay or enjoining, by
order  of  court,  by  operation  of  law  or  otherwise,  of the  exercise  or
enforcement  of,  any  claim  or demand or any right, power or remedy  (whether
arising under the Credit Documents  or  the Financial Hedge Agreements, at law,
in  equity  or otherwise) with respect to the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or  any
agreement relating  thereto,  or  with  respect  to  any  other  guaranty of or
security  for  the  payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any rescission,
waiver, amendment or  modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of
the terms or provisions  (including  provisions  relating to events of default)
hereof,  any  of  the  other  Credit  Documents,  any of  the  Financial  Hedge
Agreements or any agreement or instrument executed  pursuant thereto, or of any
other guaranty or security for the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case whether
or  not  in  accordance  with  the terms hereof or such Credit  Document,  such
Financial Hedge Agreement or any  agreement  relating to such other guaranty or
security; (iii) the Guaranteed Obligations, or  any agreement relating thereto,
at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect;
(iv) the application of payments received from any  source (other than payments
received pursuant to the other Credit Documents or any  of  the Financial Hedge
Agreements or from the proceeds of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations,
except to the extent such security also serves as collateral  for  indebtedness
other  than  the  Guaranteed Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness  other
than the Guaranteed Obligations, even though any Beneficiary might have elected
to apply such payment to any part or all of the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) any
Beneficiary's consent  to  the  change,  reorganization  or  termination of the
corporate structure or existence of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries  and to
any corresponding restructuring of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) any failure
to  perfect  or  continue  perfection  of a security interest in any collateral
which secures any of the Guaranteed Obligations;  (vii) any  defenses, set-offs
or counterclaims which Company may allege or assert against any  Beneficiary in
respect  of  the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  including failure of consideration,
breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds,  statute of limitations, accord
and satisfaction and usury; and (viii) any other act  or  thing or omission, or
delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might in any  manner or to any
extent  vary  the  risk  of  any  Guarantor  as  an  obligor in respect of  the
Guaranteed Obligations.

       7.5.  WAIVERS  BY  GUARANTORS.  Each Guarantor hereby  waives,  for  the
benefit of Beneficiaries: (a)  any  right  to  require  any  Beneficiary,  as a
condition  of  payment or performance by such Guarantor, to (i) proceed against
Company, any other  guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other  Person,  (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security
held from Company, any such other guarantor  or any other Person, (iii) proceed
against or have resort to any balance of any Deposit  Account  or credit on the
books  of  any  Beneficiary  in  favor  of  Company  or  any  other Person,  or
(iv) pursue  any  other remedy in the power of any Beneficiary whatsoever;  (b)

                                    115
<PAGE>

any defense arising  by  reason  of  the  incapacity,  lack of authority or any
disability  or  other defense of Company or any other Guarantor  including  any
defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability
of the Guaranteed  Obligations  or any agreement or instrument relating thereto
or  by  reason of the cessation of  the  liability  of  Company  or  any  other
Guarantor  from  any  cause  other  than  payment  in  full  of  the Guaranteed
Obligations;  (c)  any  defense  based  upon  any statute or rule of law  which
provides that the obligation of a surety must be  neither  larger in amount nor
in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal;  (d)  any defense
based upon any Beneficiary's errors or omissions in the administration  of  the
Guaranteed Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (e) (i) any
principles  or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be
in conflict with  the terms hereof and any legal or equitable discharge of such
Guarantor's  obligations   hereunder,   (ii) the  benefit  of  any  statute  of
limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability  hereunder  or the enforcement
hereof,  (iii) any  rights  to  set-offs,  recoupments  and counterclaims,  and
(iv) promptness,  diligence  and any requirement that any Beneficiary  protect,
secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject
thereto; (f) notices, demands,  presentments,  protests,  notices  of  protest,
notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance
hereof,  notices  of default hereunder, the  Financial Hedge Agreements or  any
agreement or instrument  related  thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or
modification of the Guaranteed Obligations  or  any  agreement related thereto,
notices of any extension of credit to Company and notices of any of the matters
referred to in Section 7.4 and any right to consent to any thereof; and (g) any
defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded  by  law  which limit
the  liability  of  or  exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict
with the terms hereof.

       7.6.  GUARANTORS'  RIGHTS  OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC.  Until the
Guaranteed  Obligations shall have been  indefeasibly  paid  in  full  and  the
Revolving Commitments  shall  have  terminated  and all Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been cancelled, each Guarantor hereby  waives  any claim, right
or  remedy,  direct  or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may  hereafter
have against Company or  any other Guarantor or any of its assets in connection
with this Guaranty or the  performance  by  such  Guarantor  of its obligations
hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises  in  equity,
under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and including without
limitation (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification  that
such  Guarantor  now  has or may hereafter have against Company with respect to
the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any
claim, right or remedy  that  any  Beneficiary  now  has  or may hereafter have
against Company, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to participate  in,  any
collateral  or security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary.  In addition,
until the Guaranteed  Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and
the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been cancelled,  each  Guarantor shall withhold exercise of any
right  of contribution such Guarantor may  have  against  any  other  guarantor
(including  any  other  Guarantor)  of  the  Guaranteed Obligations, including,
without limitation, any such right of contribution  as  contemplated by Section
7.2.  Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement

                                    116
<PAGE>

to   withhold  the  exercise  of  its  rights  of  subrogation,  reimbursement,
indemnification  and  contribution  as  set forth herein is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable  for  any  reason,  any rights of
subrogation,  reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have  against
Company or against  any  collateral or security, and any rights of contribution
such Guarantor may have against  any  such other guarantor, shall be junior and
subordinate to any rights any Beneficiary  may  have  against  Company,  to all
right,  title  and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such collateral  or
security, and to  any  right  any  Beneficiary  may  have  against  such  other
guarantor.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such
subrogation,  reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time
when all Guaranteed  Obligations  shall  not have been finally and indefeasibly
paid in full, such amount shall be held in  trust  for  Administrative Agent on
behalf  of  Beneficiaries  and shall forthwith be paid over  to  Administrative
Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries  to  be credited and applied against the
Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured,  in  accordance  with the
terms hereof.

       7.7.  SUBORDINATION  OF  OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  Any Indebtedness of Company
or  any  Guarantor  now  or hereafter  held  by  any  Guarantor  (the  "OBLIGEE
GUARANTOR") is hereby subordinated  in  right  of  payment  to  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  and  any  such  indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee
Guarantor after an Event of Default  has  occurred  and  is continuing shall be
held  in  trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries  and  shall
forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries
to be credited  and  applied  against  the  Guaranteed  Obligations but without
affecting,  impairing or limiting in any manner the liability  of  the  Obligee
Guarantor under any other provision hereof.

       7.8.  CONTINUING  GUARANTY.   This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and
shall remain in effect until all of the  Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
paid  in  full and the Revolving Commitments  shall  have  terminated  and  all
Letters of  Credit shall have expired or been cancelled.  Each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives  any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions
giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.

       7.9.  AUTHORITY  OF  GUARANTORS OR COMPANY.  It is not necessary for any
Beneficiary to inquire into the  capacity or powers of any Guarantor or Company
or the officers, directors or any  agents acting or purporting to act on behalf
of any of them.

       7.10. FINANCIAL CONDITION OF  COMPANY.  Any Credit Extension may be made
to Company or continued from time to time,  and  any Financial Hedge Agreements
may  be  entered  into from time to time, in each case  without  notice  to  or
authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition
of Company at the time  of  any  such grant or continuation or at the time such
Financial Hedge Agreement is entered  into, as the case may be.  No Beneficiary
shall  have  any  obligation to disclose or  discuss  with  any  Guarantor  its
assessment, or any  Guarantor's  assessment,  of  the  financial  condition  of
Company.   Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from Company
on a continuing  basis  concerning  the  financial condition of Company and its
ability to perform its obligations under the Credit Documents and the Financial

                                    117
<PAGE>

Hedge Agreements, and each Guarantor assumes  the  responsibility for being and
keeping informed of the financial condition of Company and of all circumstances
bearing  upon  the  risk  of  nonpayment of the Guaranteed  Obligations.   Each
Guarantor  hereby  waives  and  relinquishes  any  duty  on  the  part  of  any
Beneficiary to disclose any matter,  fact  or  thing  relating to the business,
operations  or  conditions  of  Company  now known or hereafter  known  by  any
Beneficiary.

       7.11. BANKRUPTCY, ETC. (a)Without limiting  any  Guarantor's  ability to
file  a  voluntary  bankruptcy  petition  in respect of itself, so long as  any
Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding,  no  Guarantor  shall,  without  the
prior   written   consent  of  Administrative  Agent  acting  pursuant  to  the
instructions of Requisite  Lenders,  commence  or join with any other Person in
commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency  case  or proceeding of
or  against  Company  or  any  other  Guarantor.  The obligations of Guarantors
hereunder  shall  not  be  reduced, limited,  impaired,  discharged,  deferred,
suspended or terminated by any  case  or  proceeding, voluntary or involuntary,
involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation
or  arrangement  of Company or any other Guarantor  or  by  any  defense  which
Company or any other  Guarantor  may  have  by  reason  of the order, decree or
decision  of  any  court  or  administrative  body  resulting  from   any  such
proceeding.

             (b)    Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on
any  portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the commencement
of any  case  or proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on
any portion of  the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law
by reason of the  commencement  of  such  case  or proceeding, such interest as
would have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed  Obligations  if such case
or  proceeding  had  not  been  commenced)  shall be included in the Guaranteed
Obligations because it is the intention of Guarantors  and  Beneficiaries  that
the  Guaranteed  Obligations which are guaranteed by Guarantors pursuant hereto
should be determined  without  regard  to  any  rule  of law or order which may
relieve Company of any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations.  Guarantors will
permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession,  assignee for
the  benefit  of  creditors  or similar person to pay Administrative Agent,  or
allow the claim of Administrative  Agent  in  respect  of,  any  such  interest
accruing after the date on which such case or proceeding is commenced.

             (c)    In  the  event  that  all  or any portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations are paid by Company, the obligations  of Guarantors hereunder shall
continue and remain in full force and effect or be  reinstated, as the case may
be,  in  the  event that all or any part of such payment(s)  are  rescinded  or
recovered  directly  or  indirectly  from  any  Beneficiary  as  a  preference,
fraudulent transfer  or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded
or  recovered  shall  constitute   Guaranteed   Obligations  for  all  purposes

       9.2.  POWERS AND DUTIES.  Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each  Agent
to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to exercise such powers, rights
and remedies hereunder and under the other Credit Documents as are specifically
delegated  or  granted  to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such powers, rights  and  remedies  as  are reasonably incidental thereto.
Each Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities that are expressly
specified herein and the other Credit Documents.   Each Agent may exercise such
powers, rights and remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or
employees.  No Agent shall have, by reason hereof or  any  of  the other Credit
Documents,  a  fiduciary  relationship  in  respect of any Lender; and  nothing
herein or any of the other Credit Documents,  expressed or implied, is intended
to  or shall be so construed as to impose upon any  Agent  any  obligations  in
respect  hereof  or  any  of the other Credit Documents except as expressly set
forth herein or therein.

       9.3.  GENERAL IMMUNITY.

             (a)    No Responsibility for Certain Matters.  No Agent shall have
any duties or obligations except  those  expressly  set forth herein, nor shall
any Agent be subject to any fiduciary or other implied  duties,  regardless  of
whether  a  Default  has  occurred  and  is  continuing.   Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no Agent shall be responsible to  any  Lender  for
the    execution,   effectiveness,   genuineness,   validity,   enforceability,
collectability  or  sufficiency  hereof or any other Credit Document or for any
representations, warranties, recitals  or  statements made herein or therein or
made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other statements,
instruments, reports or certificates or any  other  documents furnished or made
by any Agent to Lenders or by or on behalf of any Credit  Party to any Agent or
any  Lender  in  connection  with  the  Credit  Documents and the  transactions
contemplated thereby or for the financial condition  or business affairs of any
Credit Party or any other Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor
shall any Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as  to  the  performance or
observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements
contained  in  any of the Credit Documents or as to the use of the proceeds  of
the Loans or as  to the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default
or Default.  Except as expressly set forth herein, no Agent shall have any duty
to  disclose, and shall  not  be  liable  for  the  failure  to  disclose,  any
information relating to any Credit Party that is communicated to or obtained by
such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  Anything contained herein
to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  Administrative  Agent  shall  not  have any
liability arising from confirmations of the amount of outstanding Loans  or the
Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts thereof.

             (b)    Exculpatory Provisions.  No Agent nor any of  its officers,
partners,  directors,  employees  or  agents shall be liable to Lenders for any
action taken or omitted by any Agent under  or  in  connection  with any of the

                                    123
<PAGE>

Credit  Documents except to the extent caused by such Agent's gross  negligence
or willful misconduct.  Each Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or
the taking  of  any  action  (including  the  failure  to  take  an  action) in
connection  herewith  or any of the other Credit Documents or from the exercise
of any power, discretion  or  authority  vested  in  it hereunder or thereunder
unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof
from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be  required  to give such
instructions  under  Section 10.5) and, upon receipt of such instructions  from
Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be), such Agent shall
be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise
such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions.  Any
Agent shall be entitled  to  rely  upon,  and shall not incur any liability for
relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument,
document or other writing believed by it to  be genuine and to have been signed
or sent by the proper Person.  Any Agent also  may rely upon any statement made
to  it orally or by telephone and believed by it  to  be  made  by  the  proper
Person,  and  shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  Any Agent may
consult with legal  counsel  (who  may  be  counsel  for  Company), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not  be  liable for any
action  taken  or  not  taken  by it in accordance with the advice of any  such
counsel, accountants or experts.

       9.4.  AGENTS ENTITLED TO ACT AS LENDER.  The agency hereby created shall
in no way impair or affect any of  the  rights  and  powers  of,  or impose any
duties  or obligations upon, any Agent in its individual capacity as  a  Lender
hereunder.   With  respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters of
Credit, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise  the  same  as if it were not performing the duties and
functions delegated to it hereunder,  and  the  term "Lender" shall, unless the
context  clearly  otherwise indicates, include each  Agent  in  its  individual
capacity.  Any Agent  and  its  Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to, own securities of, and generally  engage  in  any  kind  of banking, trust,
financial advisory or other business with Holdings or any of its  Affiliates as
if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept  fees and
other  consideration  from  Company  for  services  in  connection herewith and
otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.

       9.5.  LENDERS' REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

             (a)    Each Lender represents and warrants that  it  has  made its
own  independent  investigation  of  the  financial  condition  and  affairs of
Holdings  and  its  Subsidiaries in connection with Credit Extensions hereunder
and that it has made  and  shall  continue  to  make  its  own appraisal of the
creditworthiness  of Holdings and its Subsidiaries.  No Agent  shall  have  any
duty or responsibility,  either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any
such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any
Lender with any credit or  other  information  with  respect  thereto,  whether
coming  into  its  possession before the making of the Loans or at any time  or
times thereafter, and  no  Agent  shall have any responsibility with respect to
the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to Lenders.

                                    124
<PAGE>
             (b)    [Intentionally omitted.]

       9.6.  RIGHT TO INDEMNITY.  Each  Lender,  in  proportion to its Pro Rata
Share, severally agrees to indemnify each Agent, to the  extent that such Agent
shall not have been reimbursed by any Credit Party, for and against any and all
liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,
suits,   costs,   expenses  (including  counsel  fees  and  disbursements)   or
disbursements of any  kind  or  nature  whatsoever  which  may  be  imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Agent in exercising its powers, rights and
remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
or  otherwise  in its capacity as such Agent in any way relating to or  arising
out hereof or the  other  Credit Documents; provided, no Lender shall be liable
for any portion of such liabilities,  obligations,  losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  If any  indemnity furnished to
any Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Agent,  be insufficient
or become impaired, such Agent may call for additional indemnity  and cease, or
not  commence,  to  do  the  acts  indemnified  against  until  such additional
indemnity is furnished; provided, in no event shall this sentence  require  any
Lender  to indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage,
penalty,  action,  judgment,  suit,  cost, expense or disbursement in excess of
such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof;  and  provided,  further,  this  sentence
shall  not  be deemed to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against  any
liability, obligation,  loss,  damage,  penalty,  action, judgment, suit, cost,
expense or disbursement described in the proviso in  the  immediately preceding
sentence.

       9.7.  SUB-AGENTS.   Each Agent may perform any and all  its  duties  and
exercise its rights and powers  by  or  through  any  one  or  more  sub-agents
appointed by such Agent.  Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and
all  its  duties  and  exercise  its rights and powers through their respective
Affiliates.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply
to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates  of  each  Agent  and any such sub-
agent,  and shall apply to their respective activities in connection  with  the
syndication  of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as such Agent.

       9.8.  SUCCESSOR  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT,  COLLATERAL AGENT AND SWING LINE
LENDER.

             (a)    Administrative  Agent  and  Collateral   Agent.    Each  of
Administrative  Agent and Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving  30
days' prior written  notice  thereof  to  Lenders  and  Company,  and  each  of
Administrative  Agent  and  Collateral Agent may be removed at any time with or
without cause by an instrument  or  concurrent instruments in writing delivered
to Company and Administrative Agent or  Collateral  Agent,  as  applicable, and
signed by Requisite Lenders.  Upon any such notice of resignation  or  any such
removal,  Requisite  Lenders  shall  have  the  right, upon five Business Days'
notice to Company, to appoint a successor Administrative  Agent  or  Collateral
Agent with Company's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless  an Event

                                    125
<PAGE>

of  Default  has  occurred and is continuing or such successor is a Lender,  in
each  of  which cases  Company's  consent  need  not  be  obtained.   Upon  the
acceptance  of  any  appointment  as  Administrative  Agent or Collateral Agent
hereunder  by  a  successor  Administrative  Agent  or Collateral  Agent,  that
successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall  thereupon  succeed to
and  become  vested  with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of  the
retiring or removed Administrative  Agent  or Collateral Agent and the retiring
or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall promptly (i) transfer
to such successor Administrative Agent all sums,  Securities and other items of
Collateral held under the Collateral Documents, together  with  all records and
other documents necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance  of
the  duties of the successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent under the
Credit Documents, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Administrative
Agent  or  Collateral  Agent  such amendments to financing statements, and take
such other actions, as may be necessary  or  appropriate in connection with the
assignment to such successor Administrative Agent  or  Collateral  Agent of the
security  interests  created  under  the  Collateral Documents, whereupon  such
retiring  or  removed  Administrative  Agent  or   Collateral  Agent  shall  be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.   After  any  retiring or
removed  Administrative  Agent's  or  Collateral Agent's resignation or removal
hereunder as Administrative Agent or Collateral  Agent,  the provisions of this
Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken  or  omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent hereunder.

             (b)    Swing  Line  Lender.  Swing Line Lender may be replaced  at
any time by written agreement among Company, Administrative Agent, the replaced
Swing Line Lender and the successor  Swing  Line  Lender.  Administrative Agent
shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of  Swing Line Lender.  At the
time any such replacement shall become effective, (i) Company  shall prepay any
outstanding Swing Line Loans made by the retiring or removed Swing Line Lender,
(ii) upon  such  prepayment,  the  retiring or removed Swing Line Lender  shall
surrender any Swing Line Note held by  it  to  Company  for  cancellation,  and
(iii) Company shall issue, if so requested by successor Swing Line Loan Lender,
a  new  Swing  Line  Note  to the successor Swing Line Lender, in the principal
amount  of  the  Swing  Line Loan  Sublimit  then  in  effect  and  with  other
appropriate insertions.

       9.9.  COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS AND GUARANTY.

             (a)    Agents  under  Collateral  Documents  and  Guaranty.   Each
Lender  hereby  further authorizes Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, on behalf  of  and  for the benefit of Lenders, to be the agent for
and representative of Lenders with  respect to the Guaranty, the Collateral and
the Collateral Documents.  Subject to Section 10.5, without further written
consent or authorization from Lenders, Administrative  Agent  or  Collateral
Agent, as applicable  may  execute  any documents or instruments necessary to
(i) release any Lien encumbering any item  of  Collateral  that is the subject
of a sale or other disposition of assets permitted hereby or  to which
Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such

                                    126
<PAGE>

consent under Section 10.5) have otherwise consented or (ii) release any
Guarantor from the Guaranty pursuant to Section 7.12 or with respect to which
Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as  may  be  required  to  give  such
consent under Section 10.5) have  otherwise consented.

             (b)    Right  to  Realize  on  Collateral  and  Enforce  Guaranty.
Anything   contained  in  any  of  the  Credit  Documents   to   the   contrary

       10.3. INDEMNITY.

             (a)    In addition to  the payment of expenses pursuant to Section
10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
each  Credit  Party  agrees to defend (subject  to  Indemnitees'  selection  of
counsel), indemnify, pay  and  hold  harmless,  each  Agent  and Lender and the
officers,  partners, directors, trustees, employees, agents and  Affiliates  of
each Agent and  each  Lender  (each, an "INDEMNITEE"), from and against any and
all  Indemnified  Liabilities;  provided,   no  Credit  Party  shall  have  any
obligation  to  any  Indemnitee  hereunder  with  respect  to  any  Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities  arise  from  the  gross
negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee, and provided, further,  no
Credit  Party  shall  have  any  obligation to Issuing Bank in the event of the
wrongful dishonor by Issuing Bank of a proper demand for payment made under any
Letter of Credit issued by it (it being understood that no dishonor as a result
of a Governmental Act shall constitute  a  wrongful  dishonor).   To the extent
that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold harmless set  forth in
this  Section  10.3  may be unenforceable in whole or in part because they  are
violative of any law or  public  policy,  the  applicable  Credit  Party  shall
contribute  the  maximum  portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under

                                    128
<PAGE>

applicable law to the payment  and  satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.   To the extent permitted by applicable
law, no Credit Party shall assert, and each  hereby  waives,  any claim against
any   Indemnitee,   on   any   theory  of  liability,  for  special,  indirect,
consequential or punitive damages  (as  opposed  to  direct  or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any Credit  Document  or
any agreement or instrument or transaction contemplated hereby.

             (b)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither Holdings
nor  any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall assert, and hereby waives, any
claim  against  any  Lender  or  any of their Affiliates, directors, employees,
attorneys  or  agents,  on any theory  of  liability,  for  special,  indirect,
consequential or punitive  damages   (as  opposed  to direct or actual damages)
(whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract,  tort  or duty imposed
by  any  applicable  legal  requirement)  arising  out of, in connection  with,
arising out of, as a result of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any
Credit Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated  hereby or thereby,
the  transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the  use  of  the
proceeds  thereof  or  any  act  or  omission  or event occurring in connection
therewith, and Holdings and Company hereby waives,  releases  and agrees not to
sue upon any such claim or any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether
or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

       10.4. SET-OFF.  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable  law  and  not  by  way of limitation of any such rights,  upon  the
occurrence of any Event of Default  each  Lender  is  hereby authorized by each
Credit  Party  at  any  time  or from time to time subject to  the  consent  of
Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
without  notice  to  any Credit Party  or  to  any  other  Person  (other  than
Administrative Agent),  any  such  notice being hereby expressly waived, to set
off and to appropriate and to apply  any  and all deposits (general or special,
including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or
unmatured, but not including trust accounts)  and any other Indebtedness at any
time held or owing by such Lender to or for the  credit  or  the account of any
Credit Party against and on account of the obligations and liabilities  of  any
Credit  Party  to  such  Lender  hereunder,  under  the  Letters  of Credit and
participations  therein  and  under  the other Credit Documents, including  all
claims of any nature or description arising  out  of  or  connected herewith or
therewith, irrespective of whether or not (a) such Lender shall  have  made any
demand  hereunder  or (b) the principal of or the interest on the Loans or  any
amounts in respect of  the Letters of Credit or any other amounts due hereunder
shall have become due and  payable  pursuant  to  Section 2  and  although such
obligations  and  liabilities,  or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.
Each Credit Party hereby further grants to Administrative Agent and each Lender
a  security interest in all Deposit  Accounts  maintained  with  Administrative
Agent or such Lender as security for the Obligations.

<PAGE>
             (c)    Other Consents.  No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of the Credit Documents, or consent to any departure by
any Credit Party therefrom, shall:

                    (i)   increase any Revolving Commitment of any Lender  over
       the  amount  thereof  then in effect without the consent of such Lender;
       provided,  no  amendment,   modification  or  waiver  of  any  condition

       with  the  consent  of the Requisite Lenders, additional  extensions  of
       credit pursuant hereto  may  be  included  in  the determination of such
       "REQUISITE CLASS LENDERS" on substantially the same  basis  as  the Term
       Loan  Commitments,  the  Term  Loans,  the Revolving Commitments and the
       Revolving Loans are included on the Effective Date;

                    (iv)  alter the required application  of  any repayments or

       consent  of  Requisite Class  Lenders  of  each  Class  which  is  being
       allocated  a  lesser  repayment  or  prepayment  as  a  result  thereof;
       provided, Requisite  Lenders  may  waive,  in  whole  or  in  part,  any
       prepayment  so  long  as  the  application,  as  between Classes, of any
       portion of such prepayment which is still required  to  be  made  is not
       altered;

                    (v)   amend,  modify, terminate or waive any obligation  of
       Lenders relating to the issuance  of  or  purchase  of participations in

       and of Issuing Bank; or

                    (vi)  amend,  modify,  terminate  or waive any provision of
       Section  9  as  the  same applies to any Agent, or any  other  provision
       hereof as the same applies to the rights or obligations of any Agent, in
       each case without the consent of such Agent.

             (d)    Execution  of  Amendments,  etc.  Administrative Agent may,
but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence  of  any  Lender, execute
amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of such   Lender.  Any
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and  for the
specific  purpose for which it was given.  No notice to or demand on any Credit
Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice
or demand in  similar  or  other  circumstances.   Any amendment, modification,

                                    131
<PAGE>

termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance  with  this  Section 10.5
shall  be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each future  Lender
and, if signed by a Credit Party, on such Credit Party.

       10.6. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS.

             (a)    Generally.   This  Agreement  shall  be  binding  upon  the
parties  hereto  and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to
the benefit of the  parties  hereto  and the successors and assigns of Lenders.
No Credit Party's rights or obligations  hereunder nor any interest therein may
be assigned or delegated by any Credit Party  without the prior written consent
of  all Lenders.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed  or  implied,  shall  be
construed  to  confer  upon  any  Person  (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, Affiliates of each of  the  Agents  and  the  Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

             (b)    Register.  Company, Administrative Agent and Lenders  shall
deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders and
owners  of  the  corresponding  Commitments  and  Loans  listed therein for all
purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such  Commitment  or Loan
shall  be  effective,  in  each  case, unless and until an Assignment Agreement
effecting the assignment or transfer  thereof  shall have been delivered to and
accepted by Administrative Agent and recorded in  the  Register  as provided in
Section 10.6(d).  Prior to such recordation, all amounts owed with  respect  to
the  applicable  Commitment  or  Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed in the
Register as the owner thereof, and  any  request,  authority  or consent of any
Person  who,  at  the  time of making such request or giving such authority  or
consent, is listed in the  Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding
on  any  subsequent  holder,  assignee   or  transferee  of  the  corresponding
Commitments or Loans.

             (c)    Right to Assign.  Each  Lender  shall have the right at any
time to sell, assign or transfer all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement, including, without limitation,  all  or  a portion of its
Commitment  or  Loans owing to it or other Obligation to any Eligible  Assignee
upon the giving of notice to Company and Administrative Agent, provided

                    (i)   each  such  assignment shall be of a uniform, and not
       varying, percentage of all rights  and  obligations under and in respect
       of any Loan and any related Commitments and shall not, without Company's
       consent, result in payment to such assignee under Sections 2.19(c), 2.20
       and 2.21 that would not have been made to the assigning Lender; and

                    (ii)  any assignment to a Person  that  does  not  meet the
       requirements  of  clause  (i)  of  the  definition of the term "Eligible
       Assignee"  shall  require the prior written  consent  of  Administrative
       Agent  and,  so long  as  no  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and  is
       continuing, Company,  in  each  case  not to be unreasonably withheld or
       delayed.

                                    132
<PAGE>

             (d)    Mechanics.  The assigning  Lender  and the assignee thereof
shall  execute  and  deliver  to Administrative Agent an Assignment  Agreement,
together with such forms, certificates  or other evidence, if any, with respect
to United States federal income tax withholding  matters  as the assignee under
such  Assignment  Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative  Agent
pursuant to Section 2.20(c).  Any assignment to a Person that does not meet the
requirements of clause  (i)  of the definition of the term "Eligible Assignee,"
shall be in an aggregate amount  of  not  less  than  $100,000  (or such lesser
amount  as  may  be  agreed  by  Company  and Administrative Agent or as  shall
constitute the aggregate amount of a Class  of  Loans  or  Commitments  of  the
assigning Lender).

             (e)    Notice  of Assignment.  Upon its receipt of a duly executed
and completed Assignment Agreement,  (and  any  forms,  certificates  or  other
evidence  required  by  this Agreement in connection therewith), Administrative
Agent shall record the information  contained  in  such Assignment Agreement in
the Register, shall give prompt notice thereof to Company  and shall maintain a
copy of such Assignment Agreement.

             (f)    Representations and Warranties of Assignee.   Each  Lender,
upon  execution  and  delivery  hereof  or  upon  executing  and  delivering an
Assignment  Agreement,  as the case may be, represents and warrants as  of  its
Lender  Effective  Date that  (i) it  is  an  Eligible  Assignee;  (ii) it  has
experience and expertise in the making of or investing in commitments or  loans
such as the applicable  Commitments  or Loans, as the case may be; and (iii) it
will make or invest in, as the case may  be,  its  Commitments or Loans for its
own  account  in  the ordinary course of its business and  without  a  view  to
distribution of such  Commitments or Loans within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act  or  other federal securities laws (it being understood
that, subject to the provisions  of  this Section 10.6, the disposition of such
Commitments or Loans or any interests  therein shall at all times remain within
its exclusive control).

             (g)    Effect of Assignment.   Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Section 10.6, as of the "Effective Date"  specified  in  the applicable
Assignment  Agreement:  (i) the  assignee thereunder shall have the rights  and
obligations of a "Lender" hereunder  to  the extent such rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant  to  such  Assignment Agreement and
shall  thereafter  be  a party hereto and a "Lender" for all  purposes  hereof;
(ii) the assigning Lender  thereunder  shall,  to  the  extent  that rights and
obligations  hereunder  have been assigned thereby pursuant to such  Assignment
Agreement, relinquish its  rights  (other  than  any  rights  which survive the
termination  hereof  under  Section 10.8) and be released from its  obligations
hereunder (and, in the case of  an  Assignment  Agreement  covering  all or the
remaining  portion  of  an assigning Lender's rights and obligations hereunder,
such Lender shall cease to  be a party hereto); provided, anything contained in
any of the Credit Documents to  the  contrary notwithstanding, (A) Issuing Bank
shall continue to have all rights and  obligations thereof with respect to such
Letters of Credit until the cancellation  or  expiration  of  such  Letters  of
Credit  and  the  reimbursement  of  any  amounts drawn thereunder and (B) such

                                    133
<PAGE>

assigning  Lender  shall  continue  to  be  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  all
indemnities hereunder as specified herein with  respect  to matters arising out
of  the  prior  involvement  of  such  assigning Lender as a Lender  hereunder;
(iii) the Commitments shall be modified  to  reflect  the  Commitment  of  such
assignee  and  any  Revolving  Commitment of such assigning Lender, if any; and
(iv) if any such assignment occurs  after  the  issuance of any Note hereunder,
the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness  of  such  assignment  or as
promptly   thereafter   as  practicable,  surrender  its  applicable  Notes  to
Administrative Agent for  cancellation,  and  thereupon Company shall issue and
deliver new Notes, if so requested by the assignee  and/or assigning Lender, to
such assignee and/or to such assigning Lender, with appropriate  insertions, to
reflect the new Revolving Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of  the assignee
and/or the assigning Lender.

             (h)    Participations.   Each Lender shall have the right  at  any
time to sell, without notice to, or consent  of  the Company and Administrative
Agent one or more participations to any Person (other than Holdings, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates) in all or any  part  of its Commitments,
Loans or in any other Obligation.  The holder of any such participation,  other
than  an  Affiliate  of  the  Lender  granting such participation, shall not be
entitled to require such Lender to take  or  omit  to take any action hereunder
except  with  respect  to  any  amendment, modification or  waiver  that  would
(i) extend the final scheduled maturity  of  any Loan, Note or Letter of Credit
(unless such Letter of Credit is not extended  beyond  the Revolving Commitment
Termination  Date) in which such participant is participating,  or  reduce  the
rate or extend  the  time  of  payment  of  interest or fees thereon (except in
connection  with  a waiver of applicability of  any  post-default  increase  in
interest rates) or  reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount
of the participant's  participation  over the amount thereof then in effect (it
being understood that a waiver of any  Default  or  Event  of  Default  or of a
mandatory  reduction  in  the  Commitment  shall not constitute a change in the
terms of such participation, and that an increase  in  any  Commitment  or Loan
shall  be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participant's
participation  is  not  increased  as  a  result  thereof), (ii) consent to the
assignment or transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations
under  this  Agreement  or  (iii) release  all  or  substantially  all  of  the
Collateral under the Collateral Documents (except as  expressly provided in the
Credit Documents) supporting the Loans hereunder in which  such  participant is
participating.   The Company agrees that each participant shall be  entitled to
the  benefits  of Sections 2.19(c), 2.20 and 2.21 to the same extent as  if  it
were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph
(c) of this Section;  provided,  (i) a  participant  shall  not  be entitled to
receive  any  greater  payment  under  Section 2.20 or 2.21 than the applicable
Lender would have been entitled to receive  with  respect  to the participation
sold  to  such  participant,  unless  the  sale  of the participation  to  such
participant is made with Company's prior written consent and (ii) a participant
that would be a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender  or would be a US Lender that
is not willing or able to execute a valid Form W-9 shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 2.21 unless Company is notified  of  the participation sold
to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of Company, to
comply with Section 2.21 as though it were a Lender.  To the  extent  permitted

                                    134
<PAGE>

by law, each participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.4
as  though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject  to
Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.

                    (i)   Certain  Other Assignments.  In addition to any other
       assignment permitted pursuant  to  this Section 10.6, (i) any Lender may
       assign  and/or  pledge  all  or any portion  of  its  Loans,  the  other
       Obligations owed by or to such  Lender, and its Notes, if any, to secure
       obligations of such Lender including,  without  limitation,  any Federal
       Reserve  Bank  as  collateral  security pursuant to Regulation A of  the
       Board  of Governors of the Federal  Reserve  System  and  any  operating
       circular  issued  by  such Federal Reserve Bank; provided, no Lender, as
       between Company and such  Lender,  shall  be  relieved  of  any  of  its
       obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment and pledge, and
       provided, further, in no event shall the applicable Federal Reserve Bank
       or  trustee be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the
       assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

       10.7. INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS.  All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted
by any of such  covenants,  the fact that it would be permitted by an exception
to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not
avoid the occurrence of a Default  or  an  Event  of  Default if such action is
taken or condition exists.

       10.8. SURVIVAL  OF  REPRESENTATIONS,  WARRANTIES  AND  AGREEMENTS.   All
representations,  warranties  and  agreements  made  herein shall  survive  the
execution  and  delivery  hereof  and  the  making  of  any  Credit  Extension.
Notwithstanding  anything  herein  or  implied  by  law  to  the contrary,  the
agreements  of  each  Credit Party set forth in Sections 2.19(c),  2.20,  2.21,
10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and  the  agreements  of Lenders set forth in Sections 2.18
and  9.6 shall survive the payment of the Loans, the cancellation or expiration
of the Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of  any  amounts  drawn
thereunder, and the termination hereof.

       10.9. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.  No failure or delay  on  the part
of  any  Agent  or  any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege
hereunder or under any  other Credit Document shall impair such power, right or
privilege or be construed  to  be  a  waiver  of  any  default  or acquiescence
therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power,  right  or
privilege  preclude  other  or  further exercise thereof or of any other power,
right or privilege.  The rights,  powers  and  remedies given to each Agent and
each Lender hereby are cumulative and shall be in  addition  to and independent
of all rights, powers and remedies existing by virtue of any statute or rule of
law  or  in  any  of  the other Credit Documents or any of the Financial  Hedge
Agreements.   Any  forbearance  or  failure  to  exercise,  and  any  delay  in
exercising, any right,  power  or  remedy  hereunder  shall not impair any such
right,  power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof,  nor  shall  it
preclude the further exercise of any such right, power or remedy.

       10.10.MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.  Neither any Agent nor any Lender
shall be  under  any  obligation  to  marshal any assets in favor of any Credit
Party or any other Person or against or  in  payment  of  any  or  all  of  the
Obligations.   To  the extent that any Credit Party makes a payment or payments
to Administrative Agent  or  Lenders  (or to Administrative Agent, on behalf of
Lenders), or Administrative Agent or Lenders  enforce any security interests or
exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment  or  payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared  to  be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or  required  to  be
repaid to a trustee,  receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any
other state or federal  law,  common  law  or any equitable cause, then, to the
extent of such recovery, the obligation or part  thereof originally intended to
be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor  or  related thereto,
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such  payment  or
payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

       10.11.SEVERABILITY.  In case any provision in or obligation hereunder or
any  Note  shall  be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity,  legality   and   enforceability   of  the  remaining  provisions  or
obligations,  or of such provision or obligation  in  any  other  jurisdiction,
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

       10.12.OBLIGATIONS  SEVERAL;  INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS' RIGHTS.  The
obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall be responsible
for  the obligations or Commitment of  any  other  Lender  hereunder.   Nothing
contained  herein  or  in  any  other  Credit  Document, and no action taken by
Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed  to constitute Lenders as a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other  kind  of entity. The
amounts  payable  at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate  and
independent debt, and  each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its
rights arising out hereof and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to
be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

       10.13.HEADINGS.    Section headings   herein  are  included  herein  for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute  a  part  hereof for any
other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

       10.14.APPLICABLE LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS  OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED
IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE  LAWS  OF  THE  STATE  OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO
CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

       10.15.CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST
ANY  PARTY  HERETO  ARISING  OUT  OF OR RELATING HERETO  OR  ANY  OTHER  CREDIT
DOCUMENT, OR ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS,  MAY  BE  BROUGHT  IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL
COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND  CITY OF NEW YORK.  BY

THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN ENTERING  INTO  THIS  AGREEMENT,
AND  THAT  EACH  WILL  CONTINUE  TO  RELY  ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS RELATED FUTURE
DEALINGS.   EACH  PARTY HERETO FURTHER WARRANTS  AND  REPRESENTS  THAT  IT  HAS

VOLUNTARILY  WAIVES  ITS  JURY  TRIAL  RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL

OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS MADE HEREUNDER.
IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO
A TRIAL  BY THE COURT.

       10.17.CONFIDENTIALITY.    Each   Lender   shall   hold   all  non-public
information  regarding  Holdings  and Company and their business identified  as
such by Company and obtained by such Lender pursuant to the requirements hereof
in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential
information of such nature, it being  understood  and  agreed  by  Holdings and
Company  that,  in  any  event,  a  Lender  may  make  (i) disclosures  of such
information to Affiliates of such Lender and to their agents and advisors  (and
to  other  persons  authorized  by  a  Lender  or Agent to organize, present or
disseminate such information in connection with  disclosures  otherwise made in
accordance with this Section 10.17), (ii) disclosures of such information
reasonably required by any bona fide or potential assignee, transferee or
participant  in connection  with the contemplated assignment, transfer or
participation by such Lender of any  Loans or any participations therein or by
any direct or indirect contractual counterparties (or the professional advisors
thereto) in Financial Hedge Agreements (provided, such assignees,  transferees,
participants, counterparties  and  advisors  are  advised  of  and  agree to be
bound by  the provisions of this Section 10.17), (iii) disclosure to any rating
agency when required  by  it, provided, prior to any disclosure, such rating
agency  shall undertake in writing  to  preserve  the  confidentiality  of  any
confidential information  relating  to  the Credit  Parties received by it from
any of  the Agents  or any Lender, and (iv)  required  or  requested  by  any
governmental agency or  representative  thereof  or  by  the  NAIC  or pursuant
to legal or judicial process; provided, unless specifically prohibited by
applicable law or court order, each Lender shall make reasonable efforts to
notify Company of any request by any governmental agency or representative
thereof  (other  than  any such  request  in connection with any examination
of the financial condition or other routine examination  of  such  Lender  by
such  governmental agency) for disclosure of  any such  non-public information
prior to disclosure  of  such information.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the
contrary set forth herein, each party (and each of their respective employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitations  of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including without limitation, opinions and other tax  analyses)  that  are
provided to any such party relating to such tax treatment  and tax structure.
However, any information  relating  to  the  tax treatment  or  tax  structure
shall  remain  subject  to  the  confidentiality provisions hereof  (and  the
foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent reasonably necessary to
enable the parties hereto, their respective Affiliates, and their and their
respective  Affiliates'  directors  and employees to comply with applicable
securities laws.  For this purpose, "tax  structure"  means any facts  relevant
to  the  federal  income  tax  treatment  of  the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement but does not include information relating to the identity of any
of the parties hereto or any of their respective Affiliates.

       10.18.USURY SAVINGS CLAUSE.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein,
the  aggregate  interest  rate  charged with respect to any of the Obligations,
including all charges or fees in  connection  therewith deemed in the nature of
interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the
rate of interest (determined without regard to  the  preceding  sentence) under
this  Agreement  at  any  time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding
amount of the Loans made hereunder  shall  bear  interest at the Highest Lawful
Rate  until the total amount of interest due hereunder  equals  the  amount  of
interest  which  would  have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest
set forth in this Agreement  had  at all times been in effect.  In addition, if
when  the  Loans made hereunder are repaid  in  full  the  total  interest  due
hereunder (taking  into  account  the increase provided for above) is less than
the total amount of interest which  would have been due hereunder if the stated
rates of interest set forth in this Agreement  had at all times been in effect,
then to the extent permitted by law, Company shall  pay to Administrative Agent
an amount equal to the difference between the amount  of  interest paid and the
amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at
all times been in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it  is  the intention
of  Lenders  and  Company  to  conform  strictly to any applicable usury  laws.
Accordingly,  if  any  Lender  contracts  for,   charges,   or   receives   any
consideration  which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate,
then any such excess  shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid,
shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans
made hereunder or be refunded to Company.

       10.19.COUNTERPARTS.   This  Agreement  may  be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered  shall  be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one  and  the
same instrument.
