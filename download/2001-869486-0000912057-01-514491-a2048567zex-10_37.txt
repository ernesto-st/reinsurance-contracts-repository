            Pennsylvania. The Contractor, its employees, servants, agents and
            representatives do not have the authority to bind the Department or
            the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and they shall not make any claim
            or demand for any right or privilege applicable to an officer or
            employee of the Department or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In
            furtherance of the foregoing, the Contractor acknowledges that no
            workers' compensation or unemployment insurance coverage shall be
            provided by the Department to the Contractor's employees, servants,
            agents and representatives. The Contractor shall be responsible for
            maintaining for its employees, and for requiring of its agents and

            The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that it shall have full
            responsibility for all taxes and withholdings of all of its
            employees. In the event that any employee or representative of the
            Contractor is deemed an employee of the Department by any taxing
            authority or other governmental agency, the Contractor agrees to
            indemnify the Department for any taxes, penalties or interest
            imposed upon the Department by such taxing authority or other
            governmental agency.

      B.    Nature of Contract

            Pursuant to this Agreement, the Contractor shall arrange for the
            provision of medical and related services to MA Consumers through
            qualified health care Providers in accordance with the terms and
            conditions of this Agreement. In administering the HealthChoices
            Program, the Contractor shall comply fully with the terms and
            conditions set forth in this Agreement, including but not limited
            to, the operational and financial standards.

            to the profession. The Contractor agrees not to employ or enter into
            a contractual relationship


                                                                              23

            955.2 and 18 Pa. C.S.A. 3213(d).

            governing the MA Program at the time such services are provided.

            The Contractor shall maintain the highest standards of integrity in
            the performance of this Agreement and shall take no action in

            Comptroller for Public Health and Human Services.

SECTION V: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

      A.    In-Plan Services

            The Contractor must ensure that all services provided are Medically
            Necessary.

            1.    Amount, Duration and Scope

                  At a minimum, In-Plan Services shall be provided in the
                  amount, duration and scope set forth in the MA FFS Program and
                  be based on the MA Consumer's benefit package, unless
                  otherwise specified by the Department. If new services or
                  eligible consumers are added to the Pennsylvania MA Program,
                  or if covered services or eligible consumers are expanded or
                  eliminated, implementation by the Contractor shall be on the
                  same day as the Department's, unless the Contractor is
                  notified by the Department of an alternative implementation
                  date. When new services are added, the Department shall
                  conduct an actuarial analysis including appropriate input by
                  the Contractor, to determine if there is a need for a rate
                  change and if necessary, adjust the rates to appropriately
                  reflect the addition of the new services.


                                                                              25
<PAGE>

                  The Department has established benefit packages based on
                  category of assistance, program status code, age, and, for
                  some packages, the existence of Medicare coverage or a
                  deprivation qualifying code. In cases where the Member
                  benefits are determined by the benefit package, the most
                  comprehensive package is to be honored.

            2.    Program Exception

                  The Contractor is also required to establish a process,
                  reviewed and approved by the Department, whereby a Provider
                  may request coverage for items or services, which while
                  included under the MA Consumer's benefit package, are not
                  currently listed on the MA Program Fee Schedule. These
                  requests are recognized by the Department as a Program
                  Exception and described in 55 Pa. Code 1150.63.

            3.    Expanded Benefits

                  The Contractor may provide expanded benefits subject to
                  advance written approval by the Department. These must be
                  benefits that are generally considered to have a direct
                  relationship to the maintenance or enhancement of a Member's
                  health status. Examples of potentially approvable benefits
                  include various seminars and educational programs promoting
                  healthy living or illness prevention, memberships in health
                  clubs and/or facilities promoting physical fitness and
                  expanded eyeglass or eye care benefits. These benefits must be
                  generally available to all Members and must be made available
                  at all appropriate Contractor Network Providers. Such benefits
                  cannot be tied to specific Member performance. However, the
                  Department may grant exceptions in areas where it believes
                  that such tie-ins shall produce significant health
                  improvements for Members.

                  In order for information about expanded benefits to be
                  included in any Member information provided by the Contractor,
                  the expanded benefits must apply for a minimum of one full
                  year or until the Member information is revised, whichever is
                  later. Upon approval by the Department, the Contractor may
                  modify or eliminate any expanded benefits, which exceed the
                  benefits provided for under the MA FFS Program. Such
                  benefit(s) as modified or eliminated shall supersede those
                  specified in the Proposal. The Contractor must send written
                  notice to Members and affected Providers at least thirty (30)
                  days prior to the effective date of the change in covered
                  benefits and shall simultaneously amend all written materials
                  describing its covered benefit or provider network. A change
                  in covered benefits


                                                                              26

                  includes any reduction in benefits or a substantial change to
                  the Provider network.

                  For information to be included in materials to be used by the
                  Independent Enrollment Assistance Program (IEAP), the expanded
                  benefits must be in effect for the full calendar year for
                  which the IEAP information applies. IEAP information will be
                  updated annually on a calendar year basis.

            4.    Referrals

                  The Contractor is required to establish and maintain a
                  referral process to effectively utilize and manage the care of
                  its Members. The Contractor may require a referral for any
                  medical services, which cannot be provided by the PCP except
                  where specifically provided for in this Agreement.

            5.    Self Referral/Direct Access

                  There are some services, which can be accessed without a
                  referral from the PCP. Vision, dental care, obstetrical and
                  gynecological (OB/GYN) services and chiropractor services may
                  be self-referred, providing the Member obtains the services
                  from the PH-MCO's Provider Network.

                  The referral authorization process must not apply to the
                  delivery of family planning services. The right of the Member
                  to choose a provider for family planning services shall not be
                  restricted. Members may access at a minimum, health education
                  and counseling necessary to make an informed choice about
                  contraceptive methods, pregnancy testing and counseling,
                  breast cancer screening services, basic contraceptive supplies
                  such as oral birth control pills, diaphragms, foams, creams,
                  jellies, condoms (male and female), Norplant, injectibles,
                  intrauterine devices, and other family planning procedures as
                  described in Exhibit F of this Agreement, Family Planning
                  Services Procedures, and the Contractor must pay for the
                  Out-of-Plan Services.

                  Under Section 2111(7) of the Insurance Company Law of 1921, as
                  amended, 40 P.S. 991.72111(7), Members are to be provided
                  direct access to OB/GYN services. The Contractor must have a
                  system in place that does not erect barriers to care for
                  pregnant women and does not involve a time-consuming
                  authorization process or unnecessary travel.


                                                                              27
<PAGE>

                  Members must be permitted to select a healthcare Provider,
                  including nurse midwives participating in the PH-MCO's
                  Network, to obtain maternity and gynecological care without
                  prior approval from a PCP. This includes selecting a
                  healthcare Provider to provide Medically Necessary follow-up
                  care, an annual well-woman gynecological visit, primary and
                  preventive gynecology care, including a PAP smear and
                  referrals for diagnostic testing related to maternity and
                  gynecological care.

                  In situations where a new (and pregnant) enrollee is already
                  receiving care from an out-of-network OB-GYN specialist at the
                  time of enrollment, the member may continue to receive
                  services from that specialist throughout the pregnancy and
                  postpartum care related to the delivery.

            6.    Behavioral Health Services

                  The Contractor is not responsible to provide any services as
                  set forth in the Behavioral Health RFP and/or in the contracts
                  between the Department and the Behavioral Health Managed Care
                  Organizations (BH-MCOs).

            7.    Pharmacy Services

                  a.    General

                        The Contractor must cover, at a minimum, those
                        therapeutic categories currently covered by the
                        Department's FFS Pharmaceutical Services Program.

                        Under no circumstances will the Contractor permit the
                        therapeutic substitution of a prescription drug by a
                        pharmacist without explicit authorization from the
                        licensed prescriber.

                        The Contractor must also comply with the requirements
                        for Prior Authorization for Outpatient Prescription
                        Drugs, Section V. B.2 of this Agreement.

                  b.    Formularies

                        Formulary guidelines and approval criteria are listed in
                        Exhibit G of this Agreement, Drug Formulary Guidelines.

                        The Contractor may use a formulary as long as it meets
                        the clinical needs of the MA population and allows
                        access to all other MA FFS drug products not on the
                        formulary through


                                                                              28
<PAGE>

                        some exception process such as prior authorization in
                        accordance with Exhibit H of this Agreement, Prior
                        Authorization Guidelines. The Contractor must submit the
                        request for advance written approval by the Department
                        of the exception or prior authorization process related
                        to pharmacy services together with the request for
                        formulary approval. Pharmacy prior authorization
                        policies and procedures must be submitted to the Prior
                        Authorization Review Panel (PARP) for review and
                        approval prior to implementation. Clinical guidelines to
                        prior authorize non-formulary drugs require advance
                        written approval under the Department's Utilization
                        Review Criteria Assessment Process (URCAP) process which
                        can be found in the HealthChoices Proposers' Library.
                        All formularies must conform to the formulary guidelines
                        and approval criteria established by the Department and
                        may not be implemented prior to receiving advance
                        written approval from the Department. For additional
                        clarification on formulary guidelines, see Exhibit G of
                        this Agreement, Drug Formulary Guidelines.

                  c.    Coverage Exclusions

                        In accordance with Section 1927 of the Social Security
                        Act, 42 U.S.C.A. 1396r-8, the Contractor must exclude
                        coverage for any drug marketed by a drug company (or
                        labeler) who does not participate in the MA FFS Medicaid
                        Drug Rebate Program. Therefore, the Contractor is not
                        permitted to provide coverage for any drug product,
                        brand name or generic, legend or non-legend, sold or
                        distributed by a company that did not sign an agreement
                        with the federal government to provide rebates to the
                        Medicaid agency.

                        In addition, the Contractor must allow access to all
                        drug products covered by the MA FFS Program. This
                        includes brand name and generic products, as well as all
                        outpatient legend drugs, sold or distributed by
                        companies that participate in the rebate program for all
                        medically accepted indications, as described in Section
                        1927(k)(6) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A.
                        1396r-8(k)(6). The Contractor must include coverage for
                        non-legend drugs as required under formulary guidelines
                        and covered by the MA FFS Program. This includes any use
                        which is approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and
                        Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. 301 et seq. or, whose use is
                        supported by the American Hospital Formulary Service -

                  d.    DESI Drugs

                        The Contractor shall not provide coverage for Drug
                        Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) drugs under any
                        circumstances. DESI drugs are those drug products that
                        have been classified as less-than-effective by the Food
                        and Drug Administration (FDA).

                  e.    Pharmacy Rebate Program

                        Under the provisions of Section 1927 of the Social
                        Security Act 42 U.S.C.A. 1396r-8, drug companies that
                        wish to have their products covered through the MA
                        Program (both fee-for-service and managed care) must
                        sign an agreement with the federal government to provide
                        rebates to the State. Any drug company that does not
                        sign a rebate agreement may not have their products
                        covered through the MA Program.

                        The Contractor must negotiate with drug companies to
                        collect rebates for pharmaceutical products.

                  f.    Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Program

                        The Contractor must have written polices and procedures
                        to adhere to a DUR Program prior approved by the
                        Department. This system must be based on federal law and
                        regulation at Section 1927 of the Social Security Act,
                        42 U.S.C.A. 1396r-8 and 42 C.F.R. 456 and state
                        guidelines adopted from the existing MA FFS DUR Program.
                        DUR state guidelines can be found in Exhibit I of this
                        Agreement, Drug Utilization Review Guidelines.

                        The Contractor must have a procedure to compare pharmacy
                        encounter data use against predetermined therapeutic
                        drug criteria standards consistent with the official
                        compendia and the peer-reviewed medical literature. The
                        official compendia shall consist of the American
                        Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information, the United
                        States Pharmacopoeia - Drug Information, the DRUGDEX
                        Information System, and the American Medical Association
                        Drug Evaluations. These standards must be consistent
                        with medical practices that have been developed by
                        unbiased, independent experts through an open
                        professional consensus process. This procedure must also
                        include an ongoing review for current drug criteria


                                                                              30
<PAGE>

                        standards. All drug criteria standards must be submitted
                        to the Department for advance written approval before
                        its usage by the Contractor, under the Utilization
                        Review Criteria Assessment Process (URCAP). The URCAP
                        manual may be found in the HealthChoices Proposers'
                        Library.

                        The Contractor must have a process for the communication
                        of counseling for Members based on standards established
                        by state pharmacy law related to patient counseling and
                        to the maintenance of patient profiles.

                        The Contractor must have procedures for retrospective
                        DUR through mechanized drug claims processing and an
                        information retrieval system in accordance with Exhibit
                        I of this Agreement, Drug Utilization Review Guidelines.

                        In no case shall the Contractor's DUR Program provide
                        any financial or other incentive to a pharmacist for
                        encouraging the physician to change his/her prescription
                        order. A change to a prescription order is only
                        acceptable when warranted by clinical reasons of Member
                        safety and approved efficacy.

                  g.    Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)

                        The Contractor may use a PBM to process prescription
                        claims only if the PBM Subcontract has received advance
                        written approval by the Department. The Contractor must
                        indicate the intent to use a PBM, identify the proposed
                        PBM Subcontract and the ownership of the proposed PBM
                        subcontractor. If the PBM is owned wholly or in part by
                        a retail pharmacy Provider, chain drug store or
                        pharmaceutical manufacturer, the Contractor will submit
                        a written description of the assurances and procedures
                        that shall be put in place under the proposed PBM
                        Subcontract, such as an independent audit, to assure
                        confidentiality of proprietary information. These
                        assurances and procedures must be submitted and receive
                        advance written approval by the Department prior to
                        initiating the PBM Subcontract. The Department will
                        allow the continued operation of pre-existing PBM
                        subcontracts while the Department is reviewing such
                        pre-existing contracts.

            8.    EPSDT Services

                  The Contractor must comply with the requirements regarding
                  EPSDT services as set forth in Exhibit J of this Agreement,

                                                                              31
<PAGE>

                  The Contractor must also adhere to specific Department
                  regulations at 55 Pa. Code Chapters 3700 and 3800 as they
                  relate to EPSDT examination for individuals under the age of
                  21 and entering substitute care or a child residential
                  facility placement.

            9.    Emergency Room (ER) Services

                  The Contractor agrees to comply with the program standards
                  regarding Emergency Room (ER) Services that are set forth in
                  Exhibit K of this Agreement, Emergency Room Services.

                  The Contractor must comply with the provisions of the Balanced
                  Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and Sections 2102 & 2116 of the

                  A PH-MCO may not deny or otherwise limit Medically Necessary
                  services, such as home health services, on the grounds that
                  the Member needs, but is not receiving, a higher level of

                  hospital and who were not previously enrolled in the HC-L/C
                  Program or individuals who enter a nursing facility from a
                  hospital


                                                                              36

                  and are then determined eligible for MA will not be enrolled
                  in HC-L/C. However, should an individual leave the nursing
                  facility to reside in the HC-L/C Zone and then be determined
                  eligible for enrollment into HC-L/C, they will then be
                  required to enroll into the HC-L/C Program.

                  Individuals who are residing in nursing facilities and are
                  subsequently found eligible for MA will not be enrolled in the
                  HealthChoices Program. individuals eligible for MA, but not
                  mandated into the HC-L/C Program when they enter nursing
                  facilities, or MA Consumers who are placed in nursing
                  facilities inside the HC-L/C Zone, who previously resided
                  outside the HC-L/C Zone, will not be enrolled in the HC-L/C
                  Program.

      B.    Prior Authorization of Services

            1.    General Prior Authorization Requirements

                  The Contractor must provide Emergency Services without regard
                  to prior authorization or the emergency care provider's
                  contractual relationship with the Contractor.

                  If the Contractor wishes to require prior authorization of any
                  services which are not required to be prior authorized under
                  the MA FFS Program, the Contractor must establish and maintain
                  written policies and procedures which must have advance
                  written approval by the Department. In addition, the
                  Contractor must include a list and scope of services for
                  referral and prior authorization, which must be included in
                  the Contractor's Provider Manual and Member Handbook.
                  Contractors must receive advance written approval of the list
                  and scope of services to be referred or prior authorized by
                  the Department as outlined in Exhibit H of this Agreement,
                  Prior Authorization Guidelines and Exhibit M(1) of this
                  Agreement, Quality Management and Utilization Management
                  Program Requirements. Prior authorization policies and
                  procedures approved under previous HealthChoices contracts
                  will be considered approved under this Agreement.

                  The Contractor shall not implement prior authorization
                  policies without having sought and obtained advance written
                  approval by the Department. Denials issued under unapproved
                  prior authorization policies may be subject to retrospective
                  review and reversal at the Department's sole discretion. The
                  Department may, at its discretion, impose sanctions and/or
                  corrective action plans in the event that the Contractor
                  improperly implements any prior authorization policy or
                  procedure.


                                                                              37
<PAGE>

                  The Department will make its best efforts to review and
                  provide feedback to the Contractor (e.g., written approval,
                  request for corrective action plan, denial, etc.) within sixty
                  (60) days from the date the Department receives the request
                  for review by the Contractor. For minor updates to existing
                  approved prior authorization plans, the Department will make
                  its best efforts to review updates within forty-five (45) days
                  from the date the Department receives the request for review
                  by the Contractor.

                  The Contractor is required to process each request for prior
                  authorization of a covered service and ensure that the Member
                  is notified of the decision within two (2) business days of
                  receiving the request. If the Member does not receive written
                  notification of a decision on a request for a covered service
                  or item within twenty-one (21) days of the date the Contractor
                  received the request, the service or item is automatically
                  approved. To satisfy the twenty-one (21) day time period, the
                  Contractor must mail to the Member, the Member's PCP, and the
                  prescribing Provider a notice of partial approval or denial of
                  the request on or before the eighteenth (18th) day from the
                  date the request is received. If the notice is not mailed by
                  the eighteenth (18th) day after the request is received, the
                  request is automatically authorized (i.e., deemed approved).
                  If additional information is needed to review the request, the
                  Contractor must request such information from the appropriate
                  Provider within forty-eight (48) hours of receiving the
                  request for prior authorization of a covered service. If the
                  Contractor requests additional information, the request may be
                  pended for a reasonable time period. However, a prospective
                  utilization review decision must be communicated to the Member
                  within two (2) business days of the receipt of all supporting
                  information reasonably necessary to complete the review.

                  The Contractor may waive the prior authorization requirements
                  for services, which are required by the Department to be prior
                  authorized.

                  If a HCFA determination that an HMO has committed a violation
                  described in paragraph (a) of 42 C.F.R. Chapter IV Subsection
                  434.67 (Sanctions Against HMOs with Risk Comprehensive
                  Contracts) is affirmed on review of paragraph (d) (Informal
                  Reconsideration), or is not timely contested by the HMO under
                  paragraph (c) (Notice of Sanction), HCFA, based upon this
                  recommendation of the agency, may deny payment for new
                  enrollees of the HMO under Section 1903 (m)(5)(B)(ii) of the
                  Act. Under Subsections 434.22 and 434.42, HCFA's denial of
                  payment for new enrollees automatically results in a denial of
                  agency


                                                                              38
<PAGE>

                  payments to the HMO for the same enrollees. A new enrollee is
                  an enrollee that applies for enrollment after the effective
                  date as found in 42 C.F.R. Section 434.67(f)(l).

            2.    Prior Authorization for Outpatient Prescription Drugs

                  The Contractor may require prior authorization as a condition
                  of coverage or payment for an outpatient prescription drug
                  provided that 1) a decision whether to approve or deny the
                  prescription is made within twenty-four (24) hours, and 2) if
                  a Member's prescription for a medication is not filled when a
                  prescription is presented to the pharmacist, the PH-MCO must
                  allow the pharmacist to dispense either a seventy-two (72)
                  hour supply for a new medication, or a fifteen (15) day supply
                  for an ongoing medication if there is an Immediate Need for
                  the medication. Immediate Need is a situation in which, in the
                  professional judgment of the dispensing registered pharmacist
                  and/or prescriber, the dispensing of the drug at the time when
                  the prescription is presented is necessary to reduce or
                  prevent the occurrence or persistence of a serious adverse
                  health condition. The Contractor must issue a written denial
                  notice, in the form attached as Exhibit N of this Agreement,
                  Denial Notices, within twenty-four (24) hours from the time
                  that the prescription is presented at the pharmacy. In the
                  event that the Contractor cannot issue a written denial notice
                  within twenty-four (24) hours, the Contractor must have
                  procedures in place so as to permit the Member to receive a
                  supply of the new medication such that the supply will not be
                  exhausted prior to receipt of the notice. For drugs not able
                  to be divided and dispensed into individual doses, the
                  Contractor will make provisions to allow the pharmacist to
                  dispense the smallest amount that will provide at least a
                  seventy-two (72) hour or fifteen (15) day supply, whichever is
                  applicable. The Department will waive the seventy-two (72)
                  hour supply requirement for medications and treatments under
                  concurrent clinical review and treatments that are outside the
                  parameter of use approved by the FDA or accepted standards of
                  care.

                  The Contractor must have procedures in place to assure that if
                  a prescription for an Ongoing Medication is not authorized
                  when presented at the pharmacy, the pharmacist shall dispense
                  a fifteen (15) day supply of the prescription, unless the
                  Contractor or its designated subcontractor issued a proper
                  written notice of benefit reduction or termination at least
                  ten (10) days prior to the end of the period for which the
                  medication was previously authorized and a Grievance or DPW
                  Fair Hearing request has not been filed. If the Member files a
                  Grievance or DPW Fair Healing request from a denial of an
                  Ongoing Medication, the Contractor must authorize the


                                                                              39
<PAGE>

                  medication until the Grievance or DPW Fair Hearing request is
                  resolved. When medication is authorized due to the
                  Contractor's obligation to continue services while a member's
                  grievance or fair hearing is pending, and the final binding
                  decision is in favor of the Contractor, a request for
                  subsequent refill of the prescribed medication does not
                  constitute an ongoing medication.

                  The requirement that the Member be given at least a
                  seventy-two (72) hour supply for a new medication or a fifteen
                  (15) day supply for an Ongoing Medication does not apply when
                  a pharmacist determines that the taking of the prescribed
                  medication, either alone or along with other medication that
                  the Member may be taking, would jeopardize the health or
                  safety of the Member. In such event, the Contractor and/or its
                  subcontractor must require that its participating pharmacist
                  make good faith efforts to contact the prescriber. In such
                  instances, however, the requirement that the Contractor issue
                  a written denial notice within twenty-four (24) hours still
                  applies.

      C.    Continuity of Care

            The Contractor must comply with the procedures outlined in MA
            Bulletin #99-96-01, Continuity of Prior Authorized Services Between
            FFS and Managed Care Plans and Between Managed Care Plans for
            Individuals Under Twenty-one (21), to ensure continuity of prior
            authorized services whenever an individual under the age of
            twenty-one (21) transfers from one PH-MCO to another, from a PH-MCO
            to the MA FFS Program, or from the MA FFS Program to a PH-MCO.

            The PH-MCO must comply with Section 2117 of Article XXI of the
            Insurance Company Law of 1921, as amended, 40 P.S. 991.2117
            regarding continuity of care requirements. A bulletin detailing the
            continuity of care requirements applicable to prior authorized
            services to adult members, as well as continuity of treatment for
            non-prior authorized services for all Members will be issued by the
            Department in the near future. A draft of this bulletin can be found
            in the HealthChoices Proposers' Library.

      D.    Coordination of Care

            The PH-MCO is responsible for coordination of care for individuals
            enrolled in HC-L/C. The PH-MCO must ensure seamless and continuous
            coordination of care across a continuum of services for the
            individual member with a focus on improving health care outcomes.
            The continuum of services may include the in-plan comprehensive
            benefits package, out-of-plan benefits, and non-MA covered services
            provided by other community resources such as:


                                                                              40
<PAGE>

            1.    Nursing Facility Care

                  The PH-MCO must ensure the decisions related to placement in
                  Nursing Facilities are coordinated with the Member and, where
                  appropriate, the Member's family.

            2.    Special Services

                  Through a variety of mechanisms including Quality Management
                  and Utilization Management (QM/UM) and Special Needs Unit

            3.    Out-of-Plan Services

                  The PH-MCO is responsible to interact/coordinate with the
                  entity responsible for the Out-of-Plan Services to promote a
                  seamless


                                                                              41

                  Agreement, Out-of-Plan Services.

            4.    Coordination of Care/Letters of Agreement

                  The Contractor is responsible to coordinate the comprehensive
                  in-plan package of services with entities providing
                  Out-of-Plan Services. To clearly define the roles of the
                  entities involved in the coordination of services, the
                  Contractor must enter into coordination of care letters of
                  agreement with all school districts. County Children and Youth
                  Agencies (CCYAs) and Juvenile Probation Offices (refer to
                  Sample Model Agreement, Exhibit Q of this Agreement), and the
                  BH-MCOs (refer to Exhibit R of this Agreement, Coordination
                  with BH-MCOs). The Department encourages the Contractor to
                  make a good faith effort to enter into coordination of care
                  letters of agreement with other public, governmental, county,
                  and community-based service providers.

                  Should the Contractor be unable to enter into coordination of
                  care letters of agreement as required under this Agreement,
                  the Contractor must submit wntten justification to the
                  Department. Justification must include all the steps taken by
                  the Contractor to attempt to secure coordination of care
                  letters of agreement, or must demonstrate an existing,
                  ongoing, and cooperative relationship with the entity. The
                  Department will then determine whether or not this requirement
                  will be deemed met.


                                                                              42
<PAGE>

            All written coordination documents developed and maintained by the
            Contractor must have advance written approval by the Department and
            must be reviewed/revised at least annually by the Contractor.
            Coordination documents must be available for review by the
            Department at the time of Readiness Review and upon request
            thereafter. The written coordination documents must be submitted to
            the Department for final review and approval at least thirty (30)
            days prior to the initial transition in the HC-L/C Program. All
            written coordination documents entered into between a service
            Provider and the Contractor after implementation must also be
            approved by the Department. These written coordination documents,
            including operational procedures, must be submitted for final review
            and approval at least thirty (30) days prior to the initial
            transition in HC-L/C.

            Any written coordination documents entered into between the
            Contractor and service Providers must contain, but are not limited
            to, the provisions outlined in Exhibit S of this Agreement, Written
            Agreements Between PH-MCO and Service Providers. Under no
            circumstances may these coordination documents contain any
            definition of Medically Necessary other than the definition found in
            this Agreement.

      5.    PH-MCO and BH-MCO Coordination

            The HC-L/C PH-MCOs and the BH-MCOs are required to develop and
            implement written agreements regarding the interaction and
            coordination of services provided to MA Consumers enrolled in the
            HC-L/C Program. These agreements must be submitted and approved by
            the Department. The PH Contractors and BH Contractors in the HC-L/C
            Zone are encouraged to develop uniform coordination agreements to
            promote consistency in the delivery and administration of services.

            Program requirements covering PH/BH Provider Agreements are outlined
            in Exhibit T of this Agreement, PH/BH Provider Agreements. The
            HealthChoices Program requirements covering behavioral health
            services requirements are outlined in Exhibit U of this Agreement,
            Behavioral Health Services.

            The Contractor agrees to comply with the requirements regarding
            Coordination with Out-of-Plan Services, which are set forth in
            Section V.D.3 of this Agreement, including those pertaining to
            behavioral health.

            a.    The Contractor agrees, and the Department will use its best


                                                                              43
<PAGE>

                  efforts to require HC-L/C BH-MCOs to agree, to submit to a
                  binding independent arbitration process in the event of a
                  dispute between the Contractor and any such BH-MCOs concerning
                  their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and a
                  Behavioral HC-L/C contract. The mutual agreement of the
                  Contractor and a BH-MCO to such an arbitration process must be
                  evidenced by and included in the written agreement between the
                  Contractor and the BH-MCO.

            b.    All pharmacy services are the payment responsibility of the
                  Member's PH-MCO. The only exception is that the BH-MCO is
                  responsible for the payment of methadone and Levomethadyl
                  Acetate Hydrocchloride (LAAM). All prescribed medications are
                  to be dispensed through the Contractor's Network pharmacies.
                  This includes drugs prescribed by both the PH-MCO and the
                  BH-MCO Providers. The Contractor must follow the PH/BH
                  Pharmacy Services guidelines in Exhibit V of this Agreement,
                  PH-MCO Pharmacy Guidelines. The Department will issue a list
                  of BH-MCO Providers to the Contractor prior to the effective
                  date of this Agreement. Should the Contractor receive a
                  request to dispense medication from a BH Provider not listed
                  on the BH-MCO's Provider file, the Contractor must work
                  through the appropriate BH-MCO to identify the Provider. The
                  Contractor is prohibited from denying prescribed medications
                  solely in cases where the BH-MCO Provider is not clearly
                  identified on the BH-MCO Provider file.

      E.    Contractor Responsibility for Reportable Conditions

            The Contractor will work with State Department of Health (DOH) State
            and District Office Epidemiologists in partnership with the
            designated county/municipal health department staffs to ensure that
            reportable conditions are appropriately reported in accordance with
            Department regulations, in accordance with 28 Pa. Code 27.1 et seq.
            The Contractor will designate a single contact person to facilitate
            the implementation of this requirement.

            The Contractor is not responsible for the payment of Environmental
            Lead Investigations.

      F.    Member Enrollment and Disenrollment

            1.    General

                  The Contractor is prohibited from restricting its Members from


                                                                              44
<PAGE>

                  changing PH-MCOs for any reason. The MA Consumer has the right
                  to initiate a change in PH-MCOs at any time.

                        file transmission, information on Members voluntarily
                        enrolled or disenrolled. This file also provides
                        dispositions on alerts submitted by the Contractor.

                  c.    Disenrollment Effective Dates

                        Member disenrollments will become effective on the date

                        written policies and procedures for complying with

                  d.    Discharge/Transition Planning

                        When any Member is disenrolled from the PH-MCO because

                              HC-L/C Zone,

                        the Contractor from which the Member disenrolled must
                        remain responsible for participating in
                        discharge/transition planning for up to six (6) months
                        from the initial date of disenrollment. The Contractor

                        (upon returning to the HC-L/C Zone), unless the MA
                        Consumer chooses a different PH-MCO or is determined to
                        no longer be eligible for participation in
                        HealthChoices.

                        If the MA Consumer chooses a different PH-MCO, that
                        PH-MCO must participate in the discharge/transition
                        planning upon notification that the MA Consumer is
                        enrolled.

            11.   Services for New Members

                  The Contractor must make available the full scope of benefits
                  to which a Member is entitled from the effective enrollment

                  those services can be found in the HealthChoices Proposers'

                  The Contractor must ensure that pertinent demographic
                  information about the MA Consumer, i.e., special needs data
                  collected through the IEAP or directly indicated to the
                  Contractor by the MA Consumer after enrollment, will be used
                  by the Contractor upon the new Member's effective enrollment

                  Contractor is required to place a special needs indicator on
                  the Member's record and must outreach to that Member to
                  identify their special need or circumstance. For any Member
                  with a special needs indicator, the Contractor must perform a
                  health needs assessment within forty-five (45) days; provide
                  results of the same to the assigned PCP; and track and
                  follow-up outcomes to assure the Member's needs are adequately

                  o     Educational and preventative care programs,
                  o     The proper use of the PH-MCO identification card and the

                  o     The role of the PCP,
                  o     What to do in an emergency or urgent medical situation,
                  o     How to utilize services in other circumstances, and
                  o     How to register a Complaint, file a Grievance or request
                        a DPW Fair Hearing.

                  These policies and procedures must receive advance written
                  approval by the Department.

                  The Contractor is prohibited from contacting a potential
                  enrollee who is identified on the daily file with an automatic
                  assignment indicator (either an "A" auto assigned or "M"
                  member assigned) until ten (10) business days before the
                  effective date of the Member enrollment, unless it is the
                  Contractor responsibility under this Agreement.


                                                                              52

                  The Contractor must provide a file, via the Department's
                  Pennsylvania Open Systems Network (POSNet), to the
                  Department's EVS contractor of PCP assignments for all its
                  Members. The Contractor must provide this file at least weekly
                  or more frequently if requested by the Department. The

                  The Contractor may issue its own identification card to
                  enrolled Members. However, the Department issues an
                  identification card, called an ACCESS card, to each MA
                  Consumer, which the Member is required to use when accessing
                  services. Providers must use this card to access the
                  Department's EVS and to verify the Members eligibility. The
                  ACCESS card shall allow the Provider the capacity to access
                  the most current eligibility information without contacting
                  the Contractor directly.

                  shall have an affirmative responsibility to refer suspected
                  fraud or abuse to relevant oversight agencies.

                  Contractors who do not report such information are subject to
                  sanctions, penalties, or other actions. A standardized
                  referral process is outlined in Exhibit II of this Agreement,
                  Standardized Referrals, to expedite information for
                  appropriate disposition. The requirements of the standardized
                  referral process are incorporated by reference into this
                  Agreement.

                  The Department shall provide the Contractor with immediate
                  notice via electronic transmission or access to Medicheck
                  listings or upon request if a provider with whom the
                  Contractor has entered into an agreement is subsequently
                  suspended or terminated from participation in the Medicaid or
                  Medicare Programs. Such notification will not include the
                  basis for the departmental action, due to confidentiality
                  issues. Upon notification from the Department that a provider
                  with whom the Contractor has entered into an agreement is
                  suspended or terminated from participation in the Medicaid or

                  The Contractor must immediately notify the Department, in
                  writing, if a provider or subcontractor with whom the
                  Contractor has entered into an agreement is subsequently
                  suspended, terminated or voluntarily withdraws from
                  participation in the program as a result of suspected or
                  confirmed fraud or abuse. The Contractor must also immediately
                  notify the Department, in writing, if it terminates or
                  suspends an employee as a result of suspected or confirmed
                  fraud or abuse. The Contractor shall inform the Department, in
                  writing, of the specific underlying conduct that lead to the
                  suspensions, or voluntary withdrawal. Provider agreements
                  shall carry notification of the prohibition and sanctions for
                  submission of false claims and statements. Contractors who
                  fail to report such information are subject to sanctions,
                  penalties, or other actions. The Department's enforcement
                  guidelines are outlined in Exhibit JJ of this Agreement,
                  Guidelines for Sanctions Regarding Fraud and Abuse in the
                  HealthChoices Program.

                  The Department reserves the right to impose sanctions,
                  penalties, or take other actions when it identifies fraud and
                  abuse within a Contractors program.

                  The Contractor agrees to ensure that all of the health care
                  providers and others with whom it subcontracts agree to comply
                  with the Program Standards regarding Fraud and Abuse.

                  selection, the Contractor is required to follow the guidelines
                  described further under this provision.

            o     Should the Contractor permit selection of a PCP group and the
                  Member has selected a PCP group in the PH-MCO's Network
                  through the Enrollment Specialist, the PH-MCO must ensure that
                  upon commencement of the PH-MCO coverage, the Member's
                  selection is honored. In addition, the PH-MCO will have three
                  (3) months to outreach to this Member to make an individual
                  PCP selection within the PCP group. If the Member does not
                  make a selection within the three (3) month period, the PH-MCO
                  must ensure that the Member is assigned to a PCP within that
                  PCP group the Member initially selected. The PH-MCO must then
                  notify the Member by telephone or in writing of his/her PCP's
                  name, location and office telephone number. In addition, at no
                  time is the Contractor permitted to assign a PCP group to a
                  Member if the Member has not selected a PCP or a PCP group at
                  the time of enrollment.

            o     If the Member has not selected a PCP--through the Enrollment
                  Specialist, the PH-MCO must make contact with the Member
                  within seven (7) business days of his or her enrollment and
                  provide information on options for selecting a PCP, unless the
                  PH-MCO has information that the Member should be immediately
                  contacted due to a medical condition requiring immediate care.
                  To the extent practical, the PH-MCO must offer freedom of
                  choice to Members in making a PCP selection.

            o     If a Member does not select a PCP within fourteen (14)
                  business days of enrollment, the PH-MCO must make an automatic
                  assignment. The Contractor must consider such factors (to the
                  extent they are known), as current Provider relationships,
                  need of children to be followed by a


                                                                              74

                  pediatrician, special medical needs, physical disabilities of
                  the Member, language needs, area of residence and access to
                  transportation. The PH-MCO must then notify the Member by
                  telephone or in writing of his/her PCP's name, location and
                  office telephone number. The PH-MCO must make every effort to
                  determine PCP choice and confirm this with the Member prior to
                  the commencement of the PH-MCO coverage in accordance with
                  Section V.F so that new Members do not go without a PCP for a
                  period of time after enrollment begins.

            o     The Contractor must take into consideration, language and
                  cultural compatibility between the Member and the PCP.

            o     If a Member requests a change in his or her PCP selection
                  following the initial visit, the Contractor must promptly
                  grant the request and process the change timely.

            o     The Contractor must have written policies and procedures for
                  allowing Members to select or be assigned to a new PCP
                  whenever requested by the Member, when a PCP is terminated
                  from the Contractor's network or when a PCP change is ordered
                  as part of the resolution to a Grievance proceeding. The
                  policies and procedures must receive advance written approval
                  by the Department.

            o     In cases where a PCP has been terminated, the Contractor must
                  immediately inform Members assigned to that PCP in order to
                  allow them to select another PCP prior to the PCP's
                  termination effective date. In cases where an MA Consumer
                  fails to select a new PCP, reassignment must take place prior
                  to the PCP's termination effective date.

            o     The Contractor must consider that a Member with special needs
                  can request a specialist as a PCP. Denial of such requests are
                  appealable.

            Should the Contractor choose to implement a process for the
            assignment of a primary dentist, the Contractor must submit the
            process for advance written approval from the Department prior to
            its implementation.

      R.    Provider Services

            Provider services functions shall be required to be operated at
            least during regular business hours (9:00 am. to 5:00 p.m., Monday
            through Friday). Provider services functions include, but are not
            limited to, the following:

            o     Assisting Providers with questions concerning Member
                  eligibility status.


                                                                              75

            o     Providing to PCPs a monthly list of Members who are under
                  their care, including identification of new and deleted
                  Members. An explanation guide detailing use of the list must
                  also be provided to PCPs.

            o     Developing a process to respond to Provider inquiries
                  regarding current enrollment.

            1.    Provider Manual

                  The Contractor must keep its Network Providers up-to-date with
                  the latest policy and procedures changes as they affect the MA
                  Program. The key to maintaining this level of communication is
                  the publication of a provider manual. Copies of the provider
                  manual shall be distributed in a manner that makes them easily
                  accessible to all participating practitioners. The Contractor
                  may specifically delegate this responsibility to large
                  providers in its Provider Agreement. The provider manual must
                  be updated annually. The Department may grant an exception to
                  this annual requirement upon written request from the PH-MCO
                  provided there are no major changes to the manual. For a
                  complete description of the provider manual contents and
                  information requirements, refer to Exhibit PP of this
                  Agreement, Provider Manuals.

            2.    Provider Education

                  The Contractor must demonstrate that its Provider Network is
                  knowledgeable and experienced in treating Members with special
                  needs. The Contractor must submit a plan to the Department
                  that outlines its plans to educate and train Providers. This
                  training plan can be done in conjunction with the SNU training
                  requirements as outlined in Section V.P of this Agreement,
                  Special Needs Unit, and must also include special needs MA
                  Consumers, advocates and family members in developing the
                  design and implementation of the training plan.


                                                                              76
<PAGE>

                  The Contractor must submit its plan for measuring training
                  outcomes including the tracking of training schedules and
                  Provider attendance to the Department for approval at least
                  annually.

                  At a minimum, the Provider training must be conducted for PCPs
                  and dentists as appropriate, and include the following areas:

                  a.    EPSDT training for any Providers who serve Members under
                        age twenty-one (21).

                  b.    Identification and appropriate referral for mental
                        health, drug and alcohol and substance abuse services.

                  c.    Sensitivity training on diverse and special needs
                        populations such as persons who are deaf and hard of
                        hearing.

                  d.    Cultural competence.

                  e.    Treating special needs populations, including the right
                        to treatment for individuals with disabilities.

                  f.    Administrative processes that include, but are not
                        limited to: coordination of benefits, dual eligibles,

                  The Contractor may submit an alternate Provider training and
                  education plan should the Contractor wish to combine its
                  activities with other Contractors operating in the HC-L/C zone
                  or wish to develop and implement new and innovative methods
                  for Provider training and education. However, this alternative
                  plan must have advance written approval by the Department.
                  Should the Department approve an alternative plan, the
                  Contractor must have the ability to track and report on the
                  components included in the Contractor's alternative Provider
                  training and education plan.

      S.    Provider Network/Services Access

            The Contractor must establish and maintain adequate Provider
            networks to serve all of the eligible HC-L/C populations. Provider
            networks must include, but not be limited to: hospitals, children's
            tertiary care hospitals, specialty clinics, trauma centers,
            facilities for high-risk deliveries and neonates, specialists,
            dentists orthodontists, physicians, pharmacies, emergency

            numbers to make available all services in a timely manner.


                                                                              77
<PAGE>

            1.    Network Composition

                  The Contractor must ensure that its Provider network is
                  adequate to provide its Members in the HC-L/C zone with access
                  to quality Member care through participating professionals, in
                  a timely manner, and without the need to travel excessive
                  distances. Upon request from the Department, the Contractor
                  must supply geographic access maps detailing the number,
                  location and specialties of their Provider network to the
                  Department in order to verify accessibility of Providers
                  within their network. The Department may require additional
                  numbers of specialists and ancillary providers should it be
                  determined that geographic access is not adequate.

                  The Contractor must make all reasonable efforts to honor a
                  Member's choice of Providers who are credentialed in the
                  network.

                  Additional requirements for establishing and maintaining an
                  acceptable Provider network are as follows:

                  a.    The Contractor must ensure the provision of services to
                        persons who have special health needs or who face access
                        barriers to health care. If the Contractor does not have
                        at least two (2) specialists or sub-specialists
                        qualified to meet the particular needs of the
                        individuals, then the Contractor must allow Members to
                        pick an Out-of-Network Provider if not satisfied with
                        the Network Provider. The Contractor must develop a
                        system to determine prior authorization for Out-of-Plan
                        Services, including provisions for informing the MA
                        Consumer of how to request this authorization for
                        Out-at-Plan Services. For children with special health
                        needs, the Contractor must offer at least two (2)
                        pediatric specialists or pediatric sub-specialists.

                  b.    The Contractor must ensure and must demonstrate its
                        ability to:

                        i.    Make available to every Member a choice of at
                              least two (2) appropriate PCPs whose offices are
                              located within a travel time no greater than
                              thirty (30) minutes (urban) and sixty (60) minutes
                              (rural). This travel time is measured via public
                              transportation, where available. Members may, at
                              their discretion, select PCPs located further from
                              their homes.

                        ii.   Ensure an adequate number of pediatricians to
                              permit all Members who want a pediatrician as a
                              PCP to


                                                                              78
<PAGE>

                              have a choice of two (2) for their children within
                              the travel time limits (30 minutes urban, 60
                              minutes rural).

                        iii.  Demonstrate its attempts to contract in good faith
                              with a sufficient number of Certified Registered
                              Nurse Practitioners (CRNP) to ensure access to
                              CRNP services. While the Contractor may contract
                              with a primary care practice in which the majority
                              of primary care services are performed by CRNP's,
                              the number of CRNPs in such practices may not
                              exceed 10 percent of the total number of PCPs in
                              the Contractor's network.

                        iv.   Limit its PCP network to appropriately qualified
                              Providers. The PH-MCO's PCP network must meet the
                              following:

                              o     Seventy-five to one hundred percent
                                    (75-100%) of the Network consists of PCPs
                                    who have completed an approved primary care
                                    residency in family medicine, osteopathic
                                    general medicine, internal medicine or
                                    pediatrics;

                              o     No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
                                    the Network consists of PCPs without
                                    appropriate residencies but who have, within
                                    the past seven (7) years, five (5) years of
                                    post-training clinical practice experience
                                    in family medicine, osteopathic general
                                    medicine, internal medicine or pediatrics.
                                    Post-training experience is defined as
                                    having practiced at least as a 0.5 full-time
                                    equivalent in the practice areas described;
                                    and

                              o     No more than ten percent (10%) of the
                                    Network consists of PCPs who were previously
                                    trained as specialist physicians and changed
                                    their areas of practice to primary care, and
                                    who have completed Department-approved
                                    primary care retraining programs.

                  c.    The Contractor must ensure a choice of at least two (2)
                        pharmacies (excluding mail-order entities) within the
                        travel time limits (30 minutes urban, 60 minutes rural).

                  d.    The Contractor must ensure a choice of at least two
                        hospitals within the Provider Network, at least one (1)
                        of


                                                                              79
<PAGE>

                        which must be within the travel limits (30 minutes
                        urban, 60 minutes rural).

                  e.    The Contractor must ensure a choice of at least two (2)
                        home health agencies within the HC-L/C zone.

                        rehabilitation facilities within the Provider network,
                        at least one (1) of which must be located within the
                        zone.

                  h.    The Contractor must ensure a choice of at least two (2)
                        nursing facilities within the Provider network.

                  i.    The Contractor must ensure a choice of at least two (2)
                        general practice dentists within the Provider Network.
                        For members needing anesthesia for dental care, the
                        Contractor must ensure a choice of at least two (2)
                        dentists within the Provider Network with privileges or
                        certificates to perform specialized dental procedures
                        under general anesthesia.

                  j.    The Contractor must ensure access to Certified Nurse
                        Midwives (CNMs) and CRNPs.

                  k.    The Contractor must demonstrate its ability to offer its
                        Members freedom of choice in selecting a PCP. At a
                        minimum, the Contractor must have or provide one (1)
                        full-time equivalent (FTE) PCP who serves no more than
                        one thousand (1,000) MA Consumers (cumulative across all
                        HC-L/C PH-MCO plans) and PCP sites which serve no more
                        than five thousand (5,000) MA Consumers (cumulative
                        across all HC-L/C PH-MCO plans). The Department will
                        develop a system to notify the Contractor of a Provider
                        reaching maximum panel limits. The number of Members
                        assigned to a PCP may be decreased by the Contractor if
                        necessary to maintain the appointment availability
                        standards.

                  l.    The Contractor and the Department will work together to
                        avoid the PCP having a caseload or medical practice
                        composed predominantly of HC-L/C Members. In addition,
                        the Contractor must organize its PCP sites so as to
                        ensure continuity of care to Members and must identify a
                        specific PCP within the site for each Member. The
                        Contractor may


                                                                              80

                        apply to the Department for a waiver of these
                        requirements on a site-specific basis. The Department
                        may waive these requirements for good cause demonstrated
                        by the Contractor.

                  m.    The Contractor must demonstrate its ability to provide
                        adequate access to physician specialists for PCP
                        referrals, and must employ or contract with adult and
                        pediatric specialists in sufficient numbers to ensure
                        that specialty services are made available in a timely,
                        geographically, and physically accessible manner,
                        particularly for those Members in special needs
                        populations. The Contractor must ensure Members a choice
                        of at least two (2) appropriate specialists.

                  n.    The Contractor must contract with a sufficient number of
                        Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to ensure
                        access to FQHC services, provided FQHC services are
                        available, within a travel time of thirty (30) minutes
                        (urban) and sixty (60) minutes (rural). If the
                        Contractor's primary care network includes FQHCs, these
                        sites may be designated as PCP sites. A listing of FQHCs
                        for the HC-L/C project area is included in Exhibit QQ of
                        this Agreement, HealthChoices Federally Qualified Health
                        Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics. If a
                        Contractor cannot contract with a sufficient number of
                        FQHCs, the Contractor must demonstrate in writing it has
                        attempted to reasonably contract in good faith.

                  o.    The Contractor must comply with the provisions of Act
                        112 of 1996 (H.B. 1415, P.N. 3853, signed July 11,
                        1996), The Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997
                        and Act 68 or 1998, the Quality Health Care
                        Accountability and Protection Provisions, 40 P.S.
                        991.2101 et seq., pertaining to coverage and payment of
                        medically necessary emergency services. The definition
                        of such services is set forth herein at Section II.

                  p.    The Contractor must inspect the office of any PCP or
                        dentist who seeks to participate in Contractor's
                        provider network (excluding offices located in
                        hospitals) to determine whether the office is
                        architecturally accessible to persons with mobility
                        impairments. Architectural accessibility means
                        compliance with ADA accessibility guidelines with
                        reference to parking (if any), path of travel to an
                        entrance, and the entrance to both the building and the
                        office of the provider, if different from the building
                        entrance. If the office or facility is


                                                                              81
<PAGE>

                        not accessible, the PCP or dentist may not participate
                        in the Contractor's provider network until the barrier
                        has been removed and the office or facility is
                        accessible to persons with mobility impairments or the
                        provider presents proof of an exemption under Title III
                        of the ADA.

                  q.    The Department shall notify the Contractor and the
                        Provider of the office of any PCP or dentist that the
                        Department has determined is not architecturally
                        accessible to persons with mobility impairments. Such
                        Provider shall have ninety (90) days from the date of
                        notification that a barrier exists to remove the barrier
                        unless the Department expressly agrees to extend the
                        time for compliance. If the PCP or dentist falls to
                        remove the barrier, the Contractor shall initiate
                        appropriate action to promptly terminate the Provider's
                        participation in the Contractor's Network unless
                        notified by the Department that termination is not
                        necessary.

                  r.    The PH-MCO must ensure that all laboratory testing sites
                        providing services have either a Clinical Laboratory
                        Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certificate of waiver or a
                        certificate of registration along with a CLIA
                        identification number in accordance with CLIA 1988.
                        Those laboratories with certificates of waiver will
                        provide only the eight types of tests permitted under
                        the terms of their waiver. Laboratories with
                        certificates of registration may perform a full range of
                        laboratory tests. The PCP must provide all required
                        demographics to the laboratory when submitting a
                        specimen for analysis.

                        Contractor's provider network due to the fact that the
                        Provider has a practice that includes a substantial
                        number of patients with expensive medical conditions.

                        a reputable health care Provider practicing according to
                        the applicable legal standard of care.

                  c.    A provision that prohibits the Provider from denying

                        window prior to the effective date of the PH-MCO
                        enrollment.

                  d.    Notification of the prohibition and sanctions for
                        submission of false claims and statements.

                  j.    A requirement that the Contractor cannot prohibit or

                        behalf of an enrollee, including information regarding
                        the nature of treatment; risks of treatment; alternative
                        treatments; or the availability of alternative
                        therapies, consultation or tests.

                  g.    A requirement that the Contractor cannot terminate a
                        contract or employment with a health care Provider for
                        filing a Grievance on a Member's behalf.

                  h.    A clause which specifies that the agreement will not be
                        construed as requiring the Contractor to provide,
                        reimburse for, or provide coverage of, a counseling or
                        referral service if the Provider objects to the
                        provision of such services on moral or religious
                        grounds.

                  i.    A requirement securing cooperation with the QM/UM

                        Agreement, Quality Management & Utilization Management
                        Program Requirements.

                  j.    A requirement for cooperation for the submission of
                        encounter data for all services provided within the

                        Reporting Requirements, no matter whether reimbursement
                        for these services is made by the Contractor either
                        directly or indirectly through capitation.


                                                                              83

                  k.    A continuation of benefits provision which states that
                        the Provider agrees that in the event of the
                        Contractor's insolvency or other cessation of
                        operations, the Provider must continue to provide
                        benefits to the Contractor's Members through the period
                        for which the premium has been paid, including Members

                        conduct the necessary EPSDT screens, the PCP is
                        responsible for arranging to have the necessary EPSDT
                        screens conducted by another Network Provider and ensure

                        provide services to the contracted Members up to the end
                        of the month in which the effective date of termination
                        falls.

                  p.    A requirement that the Contractor must not discriminate
                        with respect to participation, reimbursement, or

                        the scope of the Provider's license or certification
                        under applicable State law, solely on the basis of such
                        license or certification. This paragraph must not be
                        construed to prohibit an organization from including
                        Providers only to the extent necessary to meet the needs
                        of the organization's enrollees or from establishing any

                  set forth in this Section. Revisions may be completed as
                  Provider Agreements become due for renewal provided that all
                  Provider Agreements are amended within one (1) year of the
                  effective date of this Agreement with the exception of the
                  encounter data requirements which must be amended immediately,
                  if necessary, to ensure that all Providers are submitting
                  encounter data to the Contractor within the timeframes
                  specified in Section VIII.B.1 of this Agreement, Encounter
                  Data and Subcapitation Data Reports.

            3.    Cultural Competence

                  Both the Contractor and Providers must demonstrate cultural
                  competency and must understand that cultural differences
                  between Provider and Member cannot be permitted to present
                  barriers to accessing and receiving quality health care; must
                  demonstrate the willingness and ability to make the necessary
                  distinctions between traditional treatment methods and/or
                  non-traditional treatment methods that are consistent with the
                  Member's cultural background and which may be equally or more
                  effective and appropriate for the particular Member; and
                  demonstrate consistency in providing quality care across a
                  variety of cultures. For example, language, religious beliefs,
                  cultural norms, social-economic conditions, diet, etc., may
                  make one treatment method more palatable to a member of a
                  particular culture than to another of a differing culture.

            4.    Primary Care Practitioner (PCP) Responsibilities

                  The Contractor must have written policies and procedures for
                  assigning every Member to a PCP. The PCP must serve as the
                  Member's initial and most important point of contact regarding
                  health care needs. As such, PCP responsibilities include at a
                  minimum:


                                                                              85
<PAGE>

                  a.    Providing primary and preventive care and acting as the
                        Member's advocate, providing, recommending and arranging
                        for care.

                  b.    Documenting all care rendered in a complete and accurate
                        encounter record that meets or exceeds the DPW data
                        specifications.

                  c.    Maintaining continuity of each Member's health care.

                  d.    Making referrals for specialty care and other Medically
                        Necessary services, both in and out-of-plan.

                  e.    Maintaining a current medical record for the Member,
                        including documentation of all services provided to the
                        member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or referral
                        services.

                  f.    Arranging for behavioral health services in accordance
                        with Exhibit U of this Agreement, Behavioral Health
                        Services.

                  The Contractor agrees to retain responsibility for monitoring
                  PCP actions to ensure they comply with the provisions of this
                  Agreement.

            5.    Specialists as PCPs

                  A Member may qualify to select a specialist to act as PCP if
                  s/he has a disease or condition that is life threatening,
                  degenerative, or disabling.

                  The PH-MCO must adopt and maintain procedures by which an
                  enrollee with a life-threatening, degenerative or disabling
                  disease or condition shall, upon request, receive an
                  evaluation and, if the Contractor's established standards are
                  met, be permitted to receive:

                  a.    A standing referral to a specialist with clinical
                        expertise in treating the disease or condition; or

                  b.    The designation of a specialist to provide and
                        coordinate the enrollee's primary and specialty care.

                  The referral to or designation of a specialist must be
                  pursuant to a treatment plan approved by the Contractor, in
                  consultation with the PCP, the enrollee and, as appropriate,
                  the specialist. When possible,


                                                                              86
<PAGE>

                  the specialist must be a health care Provider participating in
                  the Contractor's Network.

                  Information for MA Consumers must include a description of the
                  procedures that a Member with a life-threatening, degenerative
                  or disabling disease or condition shall follow and satisfy to
                  be eligible for:

                  o     A standing referral to a specialist with clinical
                        expertise in treating the disease or condition; or

                  o     The designation of a specialist to provide and
                        coordinate the enrollee's primary and specialty care.

                  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure adequate
                  Network capacity of qualified specialists as PCPs. These
                  physicians may be predetermined and listed in the directory
                  but may also be determined on an as needed basis. All
                  determinations must comply with specifications set out by DOH
                  in Exhibit SS of this Agreement, HMO Technical Advisory
                  #96-1. The Contractor must establish and maintain its own
                  credentialing and recredentialing policies and procedures to
                  ensure compliance with these specifications.

                  The Contractor must ensure that Providers credentialed as
                  specialists and as PCPs agree to meet all of the Contractor's
                  standards for credentialing PCPs and specialists, including
                  compliance with record keeping standards, the Department's
                  access and availability standards and other QM/UM Program
                  standards. The specialist as a PCP must agree to provide or
                  arrange for all primary care, consistent with Contractor
                  preventive care guidelines, including routine preventive care,
                  and to provide those specialty medical services consistent
                  with the Member's "special need" in accordance with the
                  Contractor's standards and within the scope of the specialty
                  training and clinical expertise. In order to accommodate the
                  full spectrum of care, the specialist as a PCP also must have
                  admitting privileges at a hospital in the Contractor's
                  Network.

            6.    Any Willing Pharmacy

                  The Contractor must contract on an equal basis with any
                  pharmacy qualified to participate in the MA FFS Program that
                  is willing to comply with the Contractor's payment rates and
                  terms and to adhere to quality standards established by the
                  Contractor as required by 62 P.S. 449.


                                                                              87
<PAGE>

            7.    Hospital Related Party

                  The Department requires that a hospital that is a Related
                  Party to a Contractor shall be willing to negotiate in good
                  faith with other contractors regarding the provision of
                  services to MA Consumers. The Department reserves the right to
                  terminate this Agreement with the Contractor if it determines
                  that a hospital related to the Contractor has refused to
                  negotiate in good faith with other contractors.

            8.    Mainstreaming

                  The Contractor must ensure that Network Providers do not
                  intentionally segregate their Members in any way from other
                  persons receiving services.

                  The Contractor must investigate complaints and take
                  affirmative action so that Members are provided covered
                  services without regard to race, color, creed, sex, religion,
                  age, national origin, ancestry, marital status, sexual
                  orientation, language. MA status, health status, disease or
                  pre-existing condition, anticipated need for health care or
                  physical or mental handicap, except where medically indicated.
                  Example of prohibited practices include, but are not limited
                  to, the following:

                  o     Denying or not providing a Member any MA covered service
                        or availability of a facility within the Contractor's
                        Network. The Contractor must have explicit policies to
                        provide access to complex interventions such as
                        cardiopulmonary resuscitations, intensive care,
                        transplantation and rehabilitation when medically
                        indicated and must educate its Providers on these
                        policies. Health care and treatment necessary to
                        preserve life shall be provided to all persons who are
                        not terminally ill or permanently unconscious, except
                        where a competent Member objects to such care on his/her
                        own behalf.

                  o     Subjecting a Member to segregated, separate, or
                        different treatment, including a different place or time
                        from that provided to other members, public or private
                        patients, in any manner related to the receipt of any MA
                        covered service, except where Medically Necessary.

                  o     The assignment of times or places for the provision of
                        services on the basis of the race, color, creed,
                        religion, age, sex, national origin, ancestry, marital
                        status, sexual orientation, income status, program
                        membership, language, MA status, health status, disease
                        or pre-existing condition, anticipated need for


                                                                              88

                        health care or physical or mental disability of the
                        participants to be served.

                  If the Contractor knowingly executes an agreement with a
                  Provider with the intent of allowing or permitting the
                  Provider to implement barriers to care (i.e. the terms of the
                  Provider Agreement are more restrictive than this Agreement),
                  the Contractor shall be in breach of this Agreement.

            9.    Network Changes

                  The Contractor must notify the Department promptly of any
                  changes to the composition of its Provider Network that
                  materially affects the Contractor's ability to make available
                  all services covered by this Agreement in a timely manner. The
                  Contractor also must have procedures to address changes in its
                  Network that negatively affect the ability of Members to
                  access services. Material changes in network composition that
                  negatively affect Member access to services may be grounds for
                  termination of this Agreement.

                  a.    For PCP terminations, the Contractor must provide thirty
                        (30) days advance written notice to Members assigned to
                        the PCP and must provide for or assist with those
                        assignments of the Member to another PCP. The Contractor
                        must ensure the timely and complete transfer of medical
                        records to the new PCP.

                  b.    For hospital terminations, the Contractor must provide
                        thirty (30) days advance notice to Members assigned to
                        any PCPs or PCP groups that will be terminated as a
                        result of the hospital termination. In addition, the
                        Department may require notification to all Members of a
                        hospital change.

                  c.    The Department will work with the Contractor to identify
                        those situations in which advance notification to
                        Members of an ancillary Provider termination is
                        necessary, with special consideration given to Members
                        with special needs.

                  d.    The advance notice requirement will not apply to
                        terminations by the Contractor due to quality of care or
                        other "for cause" reasons.

            10.   Other Provider Enrollment Standards

                  The Contractor agrees to comply with the program standards
                  regarding Provider enrollment that are set forth in this
                  Agreement.


                                                                              89
<PAGE>

                  All Providers operating within the Contractor's network who
                  provide services to MA Consumers must be enrolled in the
                  Commonwealth's MA Program and possess an active Medical
                  Assistance Identification (MAID) number.

                  The Contractor must enroll a sufficient number of Providers
                  qualified to conduct the specialty evaluations necessary for
                  conducting alleged physical and/or sexual abuse
                  investigations.

                  The Department encourages the use of providers currently
                  contracting with the County Children and Youth Agencies who
                  have experience with the foster care population and who have
                  been providing services to children and youth MA Consumers for
                  many years.

            11.   Twenty-Four Hour Coverage

                  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to have coverage
                  available directly or through its PCPs either directly or
                  through on-call arrangements with other qualified Providers
                  for Urgent or Emergency Care on a twenty-four (24) hour, seven
                  (7) day-a-week basis. The Contractor shall not use central
                  services without knowledge of the Member in lieu of the above
                  PCP emergency coverage requirements. For Emergency or Urgent
                  Medical Conditions, the Contractor must have written policies
                  and procedures on how Members and Providers can make contact
                  to receive instruction or prior authorization for treatment.
                  If it is determined that emergency care is not required by the
                  PCP or the Contractor, the PCP must immediately arrange to see
                  the Member or refer the Member to an urgent care clinic which
                  can immediately see the Member in accordance with Section
                  V.S.12 of the Agreement, Appointment Standards.

            12.   Appointment Standards

                  The Contractor agrees to require the PCP, dentist, or
                  specialist to conduct affirmative outreach whenever a Member
                  misses an appointment and to document this in the medical
                  record. Such an effort shall be deemed to be reasonable if it
                  includes three (3) attempts to contact the Member. Such
                  attempts may include, but are not be limited to: written
                  attempts, telephone calls and home visits. At least one (1)
                  such attempt must be written.

                  a.    General

                        PCP scheduling procedures must ensure that:


                                                                              90
<PAGE>

                        i.    Emergency cases must be seen immediately or
                              referred to an emergency facility. If it is
                              determined that Emergency Medical Condition care
                              is not required, the Member must be seen at once
                              by the PCP or referred to an open urgent care
                              clinic.

                        ii.   Urgent Medical Condition cases must be scheduled
                              within twenty-four (24) hours.

                        iii.  Routine appointments must be scheduled within ten
                              (10) business days.

                        iv.   Health assessment/general physical examinations
                              and first examinations must be scheduled within
                              three (3) weeks of enrollment.

                        v.    The Contractor must provide the Department with
                              its protocol for ensuring that a Member's average
                              office waiting time is no more than twenty (20)
                              minutes or at any time no more than up to one (1)
                              hour when the physician encounters an
                              unanticipated Urgent Medical Condition visit or is
                              treating a Member with a difficult medical need.

                        Should the IEAP contractor or Member notify the
                        Contractor that a new Member is pregnant or there is a
                        pregnancy indication on the files transmitted to the
                        Contractor by the Department, the Contractor must
                        contact the Member within five (5) days of the effective

                  Access.

                  The Contractor must have written policies and procedures for
                  disseminating its appointment standards to all Members through
                  its member handbook and through other means. In addition, the
                  Contractor must have written policies and procedures to
                  educate its Provider Network about appointment standard
                  requirements. The Contractor must monitor compliance with
                  appointment standards and shall have a corrective action plan
                  when appointment standards are not met.

            14.   Compliance with Access Standards

                  a.    Mandatory Compliance

                  b.    Reasonable Efforts and Assurances

                        The Contractor must make reasonable efforts to honor a
                        Member's choice of Providers among Network Providers as
                        long as:

                        i.    The PH-MCO's agreement with the Network Provider
                              covers the services required by the Member; and

                        ii.   The Contractor has not determined that the
                              Member's choice is clinically inappropriate.


                                                                              93
<PAGE>

                        The Contractor must provide the Department adequate
                        assurances that the Contractor, with respect to the
                        HC-L/C zone, has the capacity to serve the expected
                        enrollment in the HC-L/C zone by providing assurances
                        that the Contractor offers the full scope of covered
                        services as set forth in this Agreement and access to
                        preventive and primary care services and maintains a
                        sufficient number, mix and geographic distribution of
                        Providers and services in accordance with the standards
                        set forth in Section V.S of this Agreement, Provider
                        Network/Services Access.

                  c.    Contractor's Corrective Action

                        The Contractor must take all necessary steps to resolve,
                        in a timely manner, its failure to comply with the
                        access standards. Prior to a termination action or other
                        sanction by the Department, the Contractor will be given
                        the opportunity to institute a corrective action plan.
                        The Contractor must submit a corrective action plan to
                        the Department for approval within thirty (30) days of
                        notification of such failure to comply, unless
                        circumstances warrant and the Department demands a
                        shorter response time. The Department's approval of the
                        Contractor's corrective action plan will not be
                        unreasonably withheld. The Department will make its best
                        effort to respond to the Contractor within thirty (30)
                        days from the submission date of the corrective action
                        plan. If the Department rejects the corrective action
                        plan, the Contractor shall be notified of the
                        deficiencies of the corrective action plan. In such
                        event, the Contractor shall submit a revised corrective
                        action plan within fifteen (15) days of notification. If
                        the Department does not receive an acceptable corrective
                        action plan, the Department may impose sanctions against
                        the Contractor, in accordance with Section VIII.I of
                        this Agreement, Sanctions. Failure to implement the
                        corrective action plan may result in the imposition of a
                        sanction as provided in this Agreement.

      T.    QM and UM Program Requirements

            1.    Overview

                  The Contractor must comply with all QM and UM program
                  reporting requirements and must submit data in formats to be
                  determined by the Department.

            2.    General

                  The QM and UM programs must include a written program
                  description and annual work plan with a timetable of all
                  activities and performance improvement initiatives for the
                  coming year. The Department, in collaboration with the
                  Contractor, retains the right to determine and prioritize QM
                  and UM activities and initiatives based on areas identified as
                  being of importance to the Department and areas identified
                  through its analysis of external quality review (EQR)
                  findings, Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set
                  (HEDIS) measures, and encounter data submitted by the
                  Contractor. The Contractor must implement and abide by the
                  program description and work plan or amended plan as approved
                  by the Department. The QM and UM programs must:

                  a.    Include methodologies that allow for statistically valid
                        performance based monitoring of the QM and UM programs
                        and include documentation that all QM and UM activities
                        and initiatives undertaken by the plan are selected
                        through clinical and financial analysis of encounter,
                        Member demographic and other data.

                  b.    Provide evidence of evaluation and re-measurement of the
                        Contractor QM and UM activities and initiatives in order
                        to determine sustained improvement or the need for
                        further action.

                  c.    Address development, implementation, and performance
                        measurement of disease management programs that are
                        intended for selected conditions among targeted
                        populations in order to improve outcomes through the
                        quality of care provided while effectively managing
                        utilization.

            3.    Additional Utilization Management Program Requirements

                  The Contractor agrees to provide twenty-four (24) hour staff
                  availability to authorize emergency/weekend services,
                  including but not limited to: home health care, pharmacy, DME,
                  and medical supplies. The Contractor must have written
                  policies and procedures that address how Members and Providers
                  can make


                                                                              95
<PAGE>

                  contact with the plan to receive instruction or prior
                  authorization, as necessary.

                  The Contractor must ensure that all utilization review
                  decisions are made using the HealthChoices definition of
                  Medically Necessary. In addition, the Contractor must take
                  steps to ensure that determinations made by individual
                  clinical reviewers on whether or not requested care and
                  services are Medically Necessary are consistent with
                  determinations for care and services that would be found to be
                  Medically Necessary consistent with the HealthChoices
                  definition of Medically Necessary.

                  The Contractor must develop polices and procedures that allow
                  for prospective, concurrent, and retrospective determination
                  of medical necessity, which are based on the HealthChoices
                  Program's definition of Medically Necessary and meet
                  HealthChoices Program's timeframes for the processing of
                  requests, for elective, urgent and Emergency Services as
                  outlined in Exhibit H of this Agreement, Prior Authorization
                  Guidelines.

                  In addition, the Contractor must submit utilization review
                  criteria and policies/procedures that contain utilization
                  review criteria used to determine medical necessity to the
                  Department for evaluation under the Utilization Review
                  Criteria Assessment Process (URCAP).

            4.    Healthplan Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS)

                  The Contractor must submit data to the Department by June 15th
                  of the current year. The calendar year is the standard
                  measurement year for HEDIS data. HEDIS measures are specified
                  for one of three data collection methodologies:
                  administrative, hybrid or survey. The administrative
                  methodology requires that contractors identify the denominator
                  and numerator using transaction data or other administrative
                  databases. The denominator includes all eligible Members.

                  The Contractor will report a rate based on all Members who
                  meet the criteria who are found through administrative data to
                  have received the service identified in the numerator data.

                  The hybrid methodology requires that the Contractor identify
                  the denominator and the numerator through both administrative
                  and medical record data. The denominator consists of a
                  systematic sample of members drawn from the measure's eligible
                  population.


                                                                              98
<PAGE>

                  The Contractor will report a rate based on those Members in
                  the sample who are found through either administrative or
                  medical record data to have received the service identified in
                  the numerator. The Contractor may not report a measure using
                  the hybrid method when the numerator is derived solely from
                  administrative data.

            5.    External Quality Review (EQR)

                  The Contractor agrees to cooperate fully with any external
                  evaluations and assessments of its performance authorized by
                  the Department under this Agreement. Independent assessments
                  will include, but not be limited to, any independent
                  evaluation required or allowed by federal or state statute or
                  regulation. See Exhibit M(2) of this Agreement, External
                  Quality Review.

                  The Contractor agrees to cooperate fully with external
                  clinical record reviews that assess the Contractor's quality
                  of care, access to care, and timeliness of care i.e., any
                  studies as determined by the Department.

                  The Contractor agrees to assist in the identification and
                  collection of any data or clinical records to be reviewed by
                  the independent evaluation team members. In addition, the
                  Contractor must provide to the External Quality Review
                  Organization (EQRO) complete medical records in the timeframe
                  allowed by the EQRO.

                  requirements specified in Section VIII of this Agreement,
                  Reporting Requirements. See also Exhibit MM of this Agreement,

                  Standards, for MIS and Systems Performance Review (SPR)
                  standards. The Contractor shall be prepared to document its
                  ability to expand claims processing or MIS capacity should
                  either or both be exceeded through the enrollment of program
                  Members.

            7.    DSH/GME Payment for Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH)/
                  Graduate Medical Education (GME)

                  The Department shall make direct payments of DSH/GME to
                  hospitals. DSH and GME amounts shall not be included in
                  fee-for-service cost equivalent projections or in capitation
                  payments paid by the Department to the Contractor.

            8.    Member Liability

                  The Contractor is prohibited from holding the Member liable
                  for the following:

                  a.    Debts of the Contractor in the event of the Contractor's
                        insolvency.

                  b.    Services provided to the Member in the event of the
                        Contractor failing to receive payment from the
                        Department for such services.

                  c.    Services provided to the Member in the event of a health
                        care Provider with a contractual, referral or other
                        arrangement with the Contractor failing to receive
                        payment from the Department or the Contractor for such
                        services.

                  d.    Payments to a Provider that furnishes covered services
                        under a contractual, referral or other arrangement with
                        the Contractor in excess of the amount that would be
                        owed by the Member if the Contractor had directly
                        provided the services.


                                                                             104

            1.    Payments For In-Plan Services

                  The obligation of the Department to make payments shall be
                  limited to capitation payments, maternity care payments, and
                  any other payments provided by this Agreement.

                  a.    Capitation Payments

                        i.    The Contractor shall receive capitated payments
                              for In-Plan Services as defined in Section VII.B.1
                              of this Agreement. Capitation rates and maternity
                              care rates, applicable to the agreement year
                              beginning October 1, 2001, are set forth in
                              Exhibit B of this Agreement, Capitated Rates. This
                              agreement year, for capitation purposes, begins
                              October 1, 2001, and extends 15 months to December
                              31. 2002.

                              For the agreement year beginning January 1, 2003,
                              and for each subsequent agreement year, the
                              Department will provide an initial schedule of
                              capitation rates, maternity care rates, and Risk
                              Pool Allocation Amounts (RPAAs), not later than
                              July 1 of the previous year. The Department will
                              provide the Contractor with information on
                              methodology and data used to develop the initial
                              schedule of rates. The Department will provide
                              the Contractor with the opportunity of a meeting,
                              in which the Department will consider questions
                              from the Contractor on development of the initial
                              schedule of rates. The Department will provide
                              the Contractor with a final schedule of
                              capitation rates; maternity care rates, and
                              RPAAs, by September 30 of the year prior to the
                              effective date of the rates. If the Contractor
                              does not notify the Department of its acceptance
                              of the final schedule of rates by October 15 of
                              the same year, the Department will, at its sole
                              discretion, decide on a schedule of rates for the
                              subsequent agreement year that will consist of
                              one of the following:

                                        1.    The final schedule of capitation
                                              rates, maternity care rates and
                                              RPAAs, applicable to the
                                              subsequent agreement year,
                                              previously provided by the


                                                                             105

                                              Department; or

                                        2.    The schedule of capitation rates,
                                              maternity care rates and RPAAs
                                              applicable to the prior agreement
                                              year.

                        ii.   The Department shall make a pre-paid capitation
                              payment, referenced in Section VII.B.1.a above,
                              for each Member whose enrollment on the first day
                              of the month is indicated on the Department's CIS
                              on the first day of the month. If the Contractor
                              is responsible to provide benefits to a MA
                              Consumer who does not appear on CIS on the first
                              day of the month, the Department shall initiate a
                              capitation payment on the first day of the first
                              subsequent month on which said enrollment appears
                              on CIS. The Department will compute capitation
                              payments using per diem rates. The Department will
                              make a monthly payment to the PH-MCO for each MA
                              Consumer enrolled in the PH-MCO, for the first day
                              in the month the MA Consumer is enrolled in the
                              PH-MCO and for each subsequent day through, and
                              including the last day of the month.

                        iii.  The Department shall make each monthly capitation
                              payment by the fifteenth of the month. The
                              Department shall seek to make arrangements for
                              payment by wire transfer or electronic funds
                              transfer. If such arrangements are not in place,
                              payment shall be made by U.S. Mail.

                        iv.   The Department shall not make a capitation payment
                              for a Recipient Month if it notifies the
                              Contractor before the first of the month that the
                              individual's MA eligibility or PH-MCO enrollment
                              ends prior to the first of the month.

                        v.    This Agreement provides for rates for SSI
                              consumers who have Medicare Part A benefits that
                              are distinct from rates for SSI consumers who do
                              not have Medicare Part A benefits. If the
                              Department's Third Party Liability (TPL) file is
                              updated to indicate Medicare Part A coverage
                              within four (4) months prior to the current month
                              for a MA Consumer at an SSI Without Medicare rate,
                              the Department shall adjust the payment to reflect
                              the rating group appropriate to the MA Consumer,
                              provided the TPL file indicates


                                                                             106

                              Medicare Part A coverage as of the first day of
                              coverage by the Contractor for this MA Consumer
                              during the month for which payment was made. If
                              the Department's TPL file is updated to adjust or
                              delete indication of Medicare Part A coverage
                              within four (4) months of a payment to the
                              Contractor for a MA consumer at an SSI with
                              Medicare or Healthy Horizons rate, the Department
                              shall adjust the payment to reflect the rating
                              group appropriate to the MA Consumer, provided the
                              TPL file does not indicate Medicare Part A
                              coverage as of the first day of coverage by the
                              Contractor for this MA Consumer during the month
                              for which payment was made. The Department shall
                              provide information to the Contractor on this type
                              of payment adjustment on an electronic file. The
                              Contractor shall utilize this information to
                              adjust its payments to Providers and instruct its
                              Providers to bill Medicare.

                        vi.   The Department will recover capitation payments
                              made for Members who were later determined to be
                              ineligible for managed care for up to twelve (12)
                              months after the service month for which payment
                              was made. The Department will recover capitation
                              payments made for deceased recipients for up to
                              eighteen (18) months after the service month for
                              which payment was made. See Exhibit BB of this
                              Agreement, PH-MCO Recipient Coverage Document.

            2.    Voluntary Risk Adjustment

                  Exhibit B provides capitation rates and maternity care rates,
                  for the agreement year beginning October 1, 2001. Exhibit B
                  includes a distinct schedule of rates applicable to the first
                  six (6) months the Contractor is responsible to provide
                  medical benefits to recipients. These rates are computed to
                  reflect a voluntary risk adjustment. The voluntary risk
                  adjustment reflects the lesser financial risk associated with
                  voluntary enrollment in a managed care program.

            3.    Maternity Care Payment

                  For each live birth, the Department shall make a one-time
                  maternity care payment to the Contractor with whom the mother
                  is enrolled on the date of birth; however, if the mother is
                  admitted to a hospital and a change in the PH-MCO coverage
                  occurs during the hospital admission, the PH-MCO responsible
                  for the hospital stay at the


                                                                             107
<PAGE>

                  time of birth shall receive the maternity care payment. The
                  amount of the maternity care payment for the agreement year
                  beginning October 1, 2001 is shown in Exhibit B of this
                  Agreement, Capitated Rates. The payment is a global fee to
                  cover all maternity expenses, including prenatal care,
                  delivery fees and post-partum care for the mother and all
                  services mandated by Act 85 of 1996 ("The Health Security
                  Act").

                  If required by the Department, the Contractor must submit
                  invoices or Data Files to the Department to receive maternity
                  care payments, consistent with specifications determined by
                  the Department.

            4.    Program Changes

                  Amendments, revisions, or additions to the State Medicaid Plan
                  or to state or federal regulations, laws, guidelines, or
                  policies shall, insofar as they affect the scope or nature of
                  benefits available to eligible persons, amend the Contractor's
                  obligations as specified herein, unless the Department
                  notifies the Contractor otherwise. The Department shall inform
                  the Contractor of any changes, amendments, revisions, or
                  additions to the State Medicaid Plan or changes in the
                  Department's regulations, guidelines, or policies in a timely
                  manner.

                  The Department shall adjust rates, as necessary, to maintain
                  the actuarial soundness of the rates to reflect the impact on
                  costs of program changes. If the Department makes an
                  adjustment to the rates, as provided by this paragraph, the
                  Department will provide information to the Contractor on the
                  methodology used to determine the amount of the rate
                  adjustment.

            5.    Supplemental Payments

                  Exhibit B provides capitation rates and maternity care rates
                  for the agreement year beginning October 1, 2001. The
                  Department will review pharmacy cost trends and changes to the
                  Medical Assistance program to determine whether any supplement
                  to the rates in Exhibit B is warranted. This determination
                  will be at the sole discretion of the Department. If the
                  Department determines a supplement is warranted, the
                  Department will make each capitation or maternity care payment
                  to the PH-MCO at the applicable rate included in Exhibit B, as
                  adjusted by the amount of the supplement. On or about July 1,
                  2001, the Department will notify the PH-MCO if the Department
                  has determined that any supplement is warranted.


                                                                             108
<PAGE>

      C.    HIV/AIDS Risk Pool

            The Department shall withhold the portion of each capitation payment
            that is designated as a Risk Pool Allocation Amount on each rate
            schedule. Funds so withheld shall be allocated to an HIV/AIDS Risk
            Pool and distributed to PH-MCOs in accordance with Exhibit VV of
            this Agreement, HIV/AIDS Risk Pool.

      D.    Claims Processing Standards, Monthly Report and Penalties

            1.    Timeliness Standards

                  The Contractor will adjudicate Provider claims consistent with
                  the requirements below. These requirements apply collectively
                  to claims processed by the Contractor and any subcontractor.
                  Subcapitation payments are excluded from these requirements.

                  The adjudication timeliness standards follow for each of three
                  categories of claims:

                  a.    Claims received from a hospital for inpatient admissions
                        ("Inpatient")

                        o     90.0% of Clean Claims must be adjudicated within
                              thirty (30) days of receipt.

                        o     100.0% of Clean Claims must be adjudicated within
                              forty-five (45) days of receipt.

                        o     100.0% of all claims must be adjudicated within
                              ninety (90) days of receipt.

                  b.    Drug claims

                        o     90.0% of Clean Claims must be adjudicated within
                              thirty (30) days of receipt.

                        o     100.0% of Clean Claims must be adjudicated within
                              forty-five (45) days of receipt.

                        o     100.0% of all claims must be adjudicated within
                              ninety (90) days of receipt.

                  c.    All claims other than inpatient and drug:


                                                                             109
<PAGE>

                        o     90.0% of Clean Claims must be adjudicated within
                              thirty (30) days of receipt.

                        o     100.0% of Clean Claims must be adjudicated within
                              forty-five (45) days of receipt.

                        o     100.0% of all claims must be adjudicated within
                              ninety (90) days of receipt.

                  The adjudication timeliness standards do not apply to claims
                  submitted by Providers under investigation for fraud or abuse
                  from the date of service to the date of adjudication of the
                  claims, Providers can be under investigation by a governmental
                  agency or the Contractor; however, if under investigation by
                  the Contractor, the Department must have immediate written
                  notification of the investigation.

                  Every claim entered into the Contractor's computer information
                  system that is not a Rejected Claim must be adjudicated. The
                  Contractor must maintain an electronic file of rejected
                  claims, inclusive of a reason or reason code for rejection.

                  The amount of time required to adjudicate a paid claim is
                  computed by comparing the date the claim was received with the
                  check date or the transmission date of an electronic payment.
                  The check date is the date printed on the check. The amount of
                  time required to adjudicate a denied claim is computed by
                  comparing the date the claim was received with the date the
                  denial notice was created or the transmission date of an
                  electronic denial notice. For an amended claim, the date the
                  Contractor received the request to adjust the payment from the
                  Provider must be recorded and counted as the date the claim
                  was received. Amended claims do not include provider appeals.

                  Checks must be mailed not later than three (3) working days
                  from the check creation date.

                  The Contractor must record, on every claim processed, the date
                  the claim was received. A date of receipt imbedded in a claim
                  reference number is acceptable for this purpose. This date
                  must be carried on claims records in the claims processing
                  computer system. Each hardcopy claim received by the
                  Contractor, or the electronic image thereof, must be
                  date-stamped with the date of receipt no later than the first
                  work day after the date of receipt. The Contractor must add a
                  date of receipt to each claim received in the form of an
                  electronic record or file within one work day of receipt.


                                                                             110

                  If responsibility to receive claims is subcontracted, the date
                  of initial receipt by the subcontractor determines the date of
                  receipt applicable to these requirements.

            2.    Sanctions

                  The Department will utilize the monthly report that is due
                  five (5) months and five (5) days after the end of the month
                  in which claims are received to determine claims processing
                  penalties. For example, the Department shall utilize the
                  monthly report that is due April 5, 2002, to determine claims
                  processing penalties for claims received in October 2001. The
                  Department shall utilize the monthly report that is due May 5,
                  2002, to determine claims processing penalties for claims
                  received in November 2001. The Department shall utilize the
                  monthly report that is due June 5, 2002, to determine claims
                  received in December 2001, and so on.

                  All claims received during the month, for which a penalty is
                  being computed, that remain unadjudicated at the time the
                  sanction is being determined, shall be considered a Clean
                  Claim.

                  If a Commonwealth audit, or an audit required or paid for by
                  the Commonwealth, determines claims processing timeliness data
                  that are different than data submitted by the Contractor, or
                  if the Contractor has not submitted required claims processing
                  data, the Department shall use the audit results to determine
                  the penalty amount.

                  The penalties included in the charts below shall apply
                  separately to:

                  a.    Inpatient claims.

                  b.    Claims other than inpatient and drug.

                  The penalties provided by this Section apply to all claims
                  included in each of the two (2) claim categories specified
                  above, including claims processed by any subcontractor.

                  Penalties in the charts below shall be reduced by one-third if
                  the Contractor has 25,000-50,000 MA Consumers. Penalties in
                  the charts below shall be reduced by two-thirds if the
                  Contractor has less than 25,000 MA Consumers.


                                                                             111

                  CLAIMS ADJUDICATION MONTHLY PENALTY CHART

                  This chart is used to compute any applicable penalty for
                  failure to adjudicate inpatient claims timely. This chart is
                  also used to compute any applicable penalty for failure to
                  adjudicate claims other than inpatient or drug.

            3.    Physician Incentive Arrangements

                  a)    Federal financial participation is only available for
                        payments to Medicaid MCOs that are in compliance with
                        the Physician


                                                                             112
<PAGE>

                        Incentive Plan (PIP) requirements included under 42
                        C.F.R. 417.479.

                  b)    42 C.F.R. 417.479(a) permits MCOs to operate PIPs only
                        if: 1) no specific payment is made directly or
                        indirectly to a physician or physician group as an
                        inducement to reduce or limit Medically Necessary
                        services furnished to an enrollee; and 2) the
                        disclosure, computation of Substantial Financial Risk,
                        Stop-Loss Protection, and enrollee survey requirements
                        of this section are met.

                  c)    MCOs must provide information specified in the
                        regulations to the Department and HCFA, upon request. In
                        addition, MCOs must provide the information on their
                        physician incentive plans to any Medicaid client, upon
                        request. MCOs that have PIPs placing a physician or
                        physician group at Substantial Financial Risk for the
                        cost of services the physician or physician group does
                        not furnish must assure that the physician or physician
                        group has adequate Stop-Loss Protection. MCOs that have
                        PIPs placing a physician or physician group at
                        Substantial Financial Risk for the cost of service the
                        physician or physician group does not furnish must also
                        conduct surveys of enrollees and disenrollees addressing
                        their satisfaction with the quality of services and
                        their degree of access to the services.

                  d)    MCOs must provide the following disclosure information
                        concerning its PIPs to the Department prior to approval
                        of the initial contract:

                        o     whether referral services are included in the PIP
                              plan,

                        o     the type of incentive arrangement used, i.e.
                              withhold bonus, capitation,

                        o     a determination of the percent of payment under
                              the contract that is based on the use of referral
                              services to determine if Substantial Financial
                              Risk exists,

                        o     panel size, and if patients are pooled, pooling
                              method used to determine if Substantial Financial
                              Risk exists,

                        o     assurance that the physician or physician group
                              has adequate stop-loss protection and the type of
                              coverage, if this requirement applies.


                                                                             113
<PAGE>

                        Where enrollee/disenrollee survey requirements exist,
                        MCOs must provide the survey results. In addition, all
                        MCOs must subsequently provide the above disclosure
                        information annually to the Department.

                  e)    These PIP regulations apply to all MCOs and any of their
                        subcontracting arrangements that utilize a PIP in their
                        payment arrangements with individual physicians or
                        physician groups. PIP regulations require that
                        physicians and physician groups be protected from risk
                        beyond the stop-loss threshold.

            4.    Retroactive Eligibility Period

                  The Contractor shall not be responsible for any payments owed
                  to Providers for services that were rendered prior to the
                  effective date of a Member's enrollment into the PH-MCO.

            5.    In-Network Services

                  The Contractor shall be responsible for making timely payment
                  for Medically Necessary, covered services rendered by Network
                  Providers when:

                  a.    Services were rendered to treat a medical emergency;

                  b.    Services were rendered under the terms of the
                        Contractor's agreement with the Provider;

                  c.    Services were prior authorized; or

                  d.    It is determined by the Department, after a hearing,
                        that the services should have been authorized.

                  The Contractor will not be financially liable for services
                  rendered to treat a non-emergency condition in a hospital
                  emergency room (except to the extent required elsewhere by
                  law), unless the services were prior authorized or otherwise
                  conformed to the terms of the Contractor's agreement with the
                  Provider.

            6.    Payment for Out-of-Network Providers

                  The Contractor will be responsible for making timely payments
                  to Out-of-Network Providers for Medically Necessary, covered
                  services when:


                                                                             114

                  a.    Services were rendered to treat a medical emergency;

                  b.    Services were prior authorized;

                  c.    It is determined by the Department, after a hearing,
                        that the services should have been authorized; or

                  d.    A child enrolled in its plan is placed in emergency
                        substitute care and the county placement agency cannot
                        identify the child nor verify MA coverage See Exhibit O
                        of this Agreement, Description of Special Services.

                  The Contractor shall not be financially liable for services
                  rendered to treat a non-emergency condition in a hospital
                  emergency room (except to the extent required elsewhere in
                  law), unless the services were prior authorized.

                  The Contractor must assume financial responsibility and
                  provide reasonable reimbursement for emergency room services
                  and urgently needed services as defined in 42 C.F.R. Section
                  417.401 that are obtained by its Members from Providers and
                  suppliers outside the Contractor's Provider network even in
                  the absence of the Contractor's prior approval.

            7.    Payments to FQHCs and Rural Health Centers (RHCs)

                  The Contractor agrees to negotiate and pay rates to FQHCs and
                  RHCs comparable to other Providers who provide comparable
                  services in the Contractor's Provider network.

                  The Contractor may require that an FQHC comply with case
                  management procedures that apply to other entities that
                  provide similar benefits or services.

            8.    Liability During an Active Grievance or Appeal

                  The Contractor shall not be liable to pay claims to Providers
                  if the validity of the claim is being challenged by the
                  Contractor through a grievance or appeal, unless the
                  Contractor is obligated to pay the claim or a portion of the
                  claim through its agreement with the Provider.

            9.    Financial Responsibility for Dual Eligibles

                  The Contractor must pay Medicare deductibles and coinsurance
                  amounts relating to any Medicare-covered service for qualified


                                                                             115

                  Medicare beneficiaries in accordance with Section 4714 of the
                  Balanced Budget Act or 1997.

                  If no contracted PH-MCO rate exists or if the Provider of the
                  service is an Out-of-Network Provider, the Contractor must pay
                  deductibles and coinsurance up to the applicable MA fee
                  schedule for the service.

                  For Medicare services that are not covered by either MA or the
                  PH-MCO, the Contractor must pay cost-sharing to the extent
                  that the payment made under Medicare for the service and the
                  payment made by the PH-MCO do not exceed 80% of the
                  Medicare-approved amount.

                  The Contractor, its subcontractors and Providers are
                  prohibited from balance billing Members for Medicare
                  deductibles or coinsurance. The Contractor must ensure that a
                  Member who is eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare benefits
                  has the right to access a Medicare product or service from the
                  Medicare Provider of his/her choice. The Contractor is
                  responsible to pay any Medicare coinsurance and deductible
                  amount, whether or not the Medicare provider is included in
                  the Contractor's Provider network and whether or not the
                  Medicare provider has complied with the authorization
                  requirements of the Contractor.

            10.   Third Party Liability (TPL)

                  The Contractor must comply with the third party liability
                  procedures defined by Section 1902(a)(25) of the Social
                  Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. 1396(a)(25) and implemented by the
                  Department. Under this Agreement, the third party liability
                  responsibilities of the Department will be allocated between
                  the Department and the Contractor.

                  a.    Cost Avoidance Activities

                        i.    The Contractor will have primary responsibility
                              for cost avoidance through the Coordination of
                              Benefits (COB) relative to federal and private
                              health insurance-type resources including, but
                              not limited to, Medicare, private health
                              insurance, Employees Retirement Income Security
                              Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.A. 1396a(a)(25)
                              plans, and workers compensation. The Contractor
                              must attempt to avoid initial payment of claims,
                              whenever possible, where federal or private health
                              insurance-type resources are available. All
                              cost-avoided funds must be reported to the


                                                                             116

                              Commonwealth via encounter data submissions and
                              financial report 8A-D. The use of the COB flag,
                              Medicare fields, and the Other Insurance Paid
                              (OIP) field shall indicate that TPL has been
                              pursued and the amount which has been
                              cost-avoided. The Contractor shall not be held
                              responsible for any TPL errors in the Department's
                              Eligibility Verification System (EVS) or the
                              Department's TPL file.

                        ii.   The Contractor agrees to pay, and to require that
                              its subcontractors pay, all Clean Claims for
                              prenatal or preventive pediatric care (including
                              EPSDT services to children), and services to
                              children having medical coverage under a Title
                              IV-D child support order to the extent the
                              Contractor is notified by the Department of such
                              support orders or to the extent the Contractor
                              becomes aware of such orders, and then seek
                              reimbursement from liable third parties. The
                              Contractor recognizes that cost avoidance of these
                              claims is prohibited with the exception of
                              hospital delivery claims, which may be
                              cost-avoided.

                        iii.  The Contractor may not deny or delay approval of
                              otherwise covered treatment or services based upon
                              third party liability considerations. The
                              Contractor may neither unreasonably delay payment
                              nor deny payment of claims unless the probable
                              existence of third party liability is established
                              at the time the claim is filed.

                  b.    Post-Payment Recoveries

                        i.    Post-payment recoveries are categorized by (a)
                              health-related insurance resources and (b) other
                              resources. Health-related insurance resources are
                              ERISA health benefit plans, Blue Cross/Blue Shield
                              subscriber contracts, Medicare, private health
                              insurance, workers compensation, and health
                              insurance contracts.

                        ii.   The Department's TPL Section retains the sole and
                              exclusive right to investigate, pursue, collect,
                              and retain all "Other Resources" as defined in
                              Section II of this Agreement, Definitions. Any
                              correspondence or inquiry forwarded to the
                              Contractor (by an attorney, provider of service,
                              insurance carrier, etc.) relating to


                                                                             117

                              a personal injury accident or trauma-related
                              medical service, or which in any way indicates
                              that there is, or may be, legal involvement
                              regarding the MA Consumer and the services which
                              were provided, must be immediately forwarded to
                              the Department's TPL Section. The Contractor may
                              neither unreasonably delay payment nor deny
                              payment of claims because they involved an injury
                              stemming from an accident such as a motor vehicle
                              accident, where the services are otherwise
                              covered. Those funds recovered by the Commonwealth
                              under the scope of these "Other Resources" shall
                              be retained by the Commonwealth.

                        iii.  Due to potential time constraints involving cases
                              subject to litigation, the Department must ensure
                              that it identifies these cases and establishes its
                              claim before a settlement has been negotiated.
                              Should the Department fail to identify and
                              establish a claim prior to settlement due to the
                              Contractor's untimely submission of notice of
                              legal involvement where the Contractor has
                              received such notice, the amount of the
                              Department's actual loss of recovery shall be
                              assessed against the Contractor. The Department's
                              actual loss of recovery shall not include the
                              attorney's fees or other costs, which would not
                              have been retained by the Department.

                        iv.   The Contractor has the sole and exclusive right to
                              pursue, collect and retain all health-related
                              insurance resources for a period of nine (9)
                              months from the date of service or six (6) months
                              after the date of payment, whichever is later. The
                              Department's TPL Section may pursue, collect, and
                              retain recoveries of all health-related insurance
                              cases which are outstanding after the earlier of
                              nine (9) months from the date of service or six
                              (6) months after the date of payment. However, in
                              those cases subject to this paragraph where
                              payment is being pursued by the Contractor but,
                              for whatever reason, has not been collected by the
                              earlier of nine (9) months from the date of
                              service or six (6) months after the date of
                              payment, the Contractor shall notify the
                              Department if action to recover has been initiated
                              by the Contractor. In such cases, the Contractor
                              shall retain exclusive responsibility for the
                              cases while they are being


                                                                             118

                              actively pursued.

                        v.    Should the Department lose recovery rights to any
                              claim due to late or untimely filing of a claim
                              with the liable third party, and the untimeliness
                              in billing that specific claim is directly related
                              to untimely submission of encounter data or
                              additional records under special request, or
                              inappropriate denial of claims for accidents or
                              emergency care in casualty related situations. The
                              amount of the unrecoverable claim shall be
                              assessed against the Contractor.

                        vi.   Encounter data that is not submitted to the
                              Department in accordance with the data
                              requirements and/or timeframes identified in this
                              Agreement can possibly result in a loss of revenue
                              to the Department. Strict compliance with these
                              requirements and timeframes shall therefore be
                              enforced by the Department and could result in the
                              assessment of sanctions against the Contractor.

                        vii.  As part of its authority under paragraph iv.
                              above, the Contractor is responsible for pursuing,
                              collecting, and retaining recoveries of
                              health-related insurance resources where the
                              liable party has improperly denied payment based
                              upon either lack of a Medically Necessary
                              determination or lack of coverage. The Contractor
                              is encouraged to develop and implement
                              cost-effective procedures to identify and pursue
                              cases which are susceptible to collection through
                              either legal action or traditional subrogation and
                              collection procedures.

            11.   Health Insurance Premium Payment (HIPP) Program

                  The HIPP Program pays for employment-related health insurance
                  for MA Consumers when it is determined to be cost effective.
                  The cost effectiveness determination involves the review of
                  group health insurance benefits offered by employers to their
                  employees to determine if the anticipated expenditures in MA
                  payments are likely to be greater than the cost of paying the
                  premiums under a group plan for those services.

                  The Department shall not purchase Medigap policies for equally
                  eligible MA Consumers in the Zone.


                                                                             119

            12.   Requests for Additional Data

                  The Contractor must provide, at the Department's request, such
                  information not included in the encounter data submissions
                  that may be necessary for the administration of TPL activity.
                  The Contractor shall use its best efforts to provide this
                  information within fifteen (15) calendar days of the
                  Department's request. There are certain urgent requests
                  involving cases for minors that require information within
                  forty-eight (48) hours. Such information may include, but is
                  not limited to, individual medical records for the express
                  purpose of determining TPL for the services rendered.
                  Confidentiality of the information shall be maintained as
                  required by federal and state regulations.

            13.   Accessibility to TPL Data

                  The Department shall provide the Contractor with access to
                  data maintained on the TPL file.

            14.   Damage Liability

                  Liability for damages is identified in Section VII.D.10 of
                  this Agreement, Third Party Liability, due to the large dollar
                  value of many claims which are potentially recoverable by the
                  Department's TPL Section.

            15.   Estate Recovery

                  Section 1412 of the Public Welfare Code, 62 P.S. 1412,
                  requires the Department to recover MA costs paid on behalf of
                  certain deceased individuals. Individuals age fifty-five (55)
                  and older who were receiving MA benefits for any of the
                  following services are affected:

                  a.    Public or private Nursing Facility services;

                  b.    Residential care at home or in a community setting; or

                  c.    Any hospital care and prescription drug services
                        provided while receiving Nursing Facility services or
                        residential care at home or in a community setting.

                  The applicable MA costs are recovered from the assets of the
                  individual's probate estate. The Department's TPL Section is
                  solely responsible for administering the Estate Recovery
                  Program.


                                                                             120

            16.   Audits

                  The Contractor is responsible to comply with audit
                  requirements as specified in Exhibit WW of this Agreement,
                  HealthChoices Audit Clause.

            17.   Restitution

                  The Contractor shall make full and prompt restitution to the
                  Department, as directed by the Department, for any payments
                  received in excess of amounts due to the Contractor under this
                  Agreement whether such overpayment is discovered by the
                  Contractor, the Department, or other third party.

SECTION VIII: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

      A.    General

            The Contractor must comply with state and federal reporting
            requirements that are set forth in this section and throughout this
            Agreement.

      B.    Systems Reports

            The Contractor must submit electronic files and data as specified by
            the Department. To the extent possible, the Department shall provide
            reasonable advance notice of such reports. These reports include,
            but are not limited to, the following (Refer to Exhibit CC of this
            Agreement, Data Support for PH-MCOs):

            1.    Encounter Data and Subcapitation Data Reports

                  The Contractor must record for internal use and submit to the
                  Department a separate record each time a Member has an
                  encounter with a Provider. A service rendered under this
                  Agreement is considered an encounter regardless of whether or
                  not it has an associated claim. Every record that is provided
                  is considered to be an encounter and will require the
                  Contractor to submit a separate encounter data record for each
                  service received by a Member. The Provider's MAID number must
                  be used when submitting required encounter data.

                  The Contractor must maintain appropriate systems and
                  mechanisms to obtain all necessary data from its health care
                  Providers to ensure its ability to comply with the encounter
                  data reporting requirements. The failure of a health care
                  Provider to provide the Contractor with


                                                                             121
<PAGE>

                  necessary encounter data shall not excuse the Contractor's
                  noncompliance with this requirement.

                  Effective on a date to be determined by the Department, the
                  Contractor must submit separate subcapitation records for each
                  advance payment made to a Contractor responsible for all or
                  part of a Member's medical care. If the payment is a
                  capitation payment, a separate record is required to report
                  the amount paid on behalf of each Member. Prior to the
                  effective date of this requirement, the Contractor must
                  provide a periodic report with summary information on
                  subcapitation payments, consistent with the content, format
                  and due date requirements specified by the Department.

                  The Contractor will be given a minimum of sixty (60) days
                  notification of any new edits or changes that DPW intends to
                  implement regarding encounter data.

                  a.    Data Format

                        The Contractor must submit encounter and subcapitation
                        data electronically over POSNet using file transfer
                        protocol (FTP). Subcapitation data reporting currently
                        being submitted via paper reports will, at a future
                        date, be required to be transmitted electronically.

                        Encounter data files must be provided in ASCII text
                        format using the appropriate format for the five
                        different record types.

                  b.    Timing of Data Submittal

                        Claims must be submitted by Providers to the Contractor
                        within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date
                        of service. It is acceptable for the Contractor to
                        include a requirement for more prompt submissions of
                        claims or encounter records in Provider Agreements.
                        Claims adjudicated by a third party vendor must be
                        provided to the Contractor by the end of the month
                        following the month of adjudication.

                        An encounter must be submitted and found acceptable by
                        the Department on or before the last calendar day of the
                        third month after the encounter's Contractor
                        payment/adjudication calendar month in which the
                        Contractor paid/adjudicated the encounter. References to
                        "accepted by the Department" refer to encounter records
                        send to DPW by the Contractor that have passed all
                        Department edits: records that fail any Department


                                                                             122
<PAGE>

                        edits are returned to the Contractor and must be
                        corrected, resubmitted to the Department, and pass all
                        edits before they are accepted by the Department.

                        One "initial" file and one "correction" file may be
                        submitted each weekday. If a file is received at the DPW
                        mainframe computer before 6 p.m. (Eastern Time), it will
                        be processed that weekday. If a file is received at the
                        DPW mainframe computer after 6 p.m. (Eastern Time), it
                        will be processed on the next weekday. Files received at
                        the DPW mainframe computer after 6 p.m. on Friday are
                        not processed until the following Monday.

                        Acceptable subcapitation data must be submitted to the
                        Department within thirty (30) days after the end of the
                        month of the subcapitation payment data.

                  c.    Data Completeness

                        The Contractor shall monitor the completeness and
                        accuracy of the encounter data from all Providers and
                        shall initiate corrective action, as necessary.

                  d.    Financial Penalties

                        The Contractor is required to provide complete,
                        accurate, and timely encounter data to the Department,
                        and to maintain complete medical records. The Department
                        may withhold a portion of the monthly capitation payment
                        as reimbursement for financial penalties assessed.
                        Financial penalties shall be calculated monthly.

                        Assessment of financial penalties is based on the
                        identification of penalty occurrences. Encounter Data
                        Penalty occurrences/assessments of financial penalties
                        are outlined in Exhibit XX of this Agreement, Encounter
                        and Subcapitation Data Penalty Occurrences.

                  e.    Data Validation

                        The Contractor agrees to assist the Department in its
                        validation of encounter data by making available medical
                        records and a sample of its claims data. The validation
                        may be completed by Department staff and/or independent,
                        external review organizations.


                                                                             123

                  f.    Secondary Release of Encounter Data

                        All encounter data recorded to document services
                        rendered to MA Consumers under this Agreement are the
                        property of the Department. Access to these data is
                        provided to the Contractor and its agents for the sole
                        purpose of operating the HealthChoices Program under
                        this Agreement. The Contractor and its agents are
                        prohibited from releasing any data resulting from this
                        Agreement to any third party without the advance written
                        approval of the Department. This prohibition does not
                        apply to internal quality improvement or disease
                        management activities undertaken by the Contractor or
                        its agents in the routine operation of a managed care
                        plan.

            2.    Federalizing GA Data Reporting

                  The Contractor shall be required to submit a properly
                  formatted monthly file to the Department regarding payments
                  applicable to state-only general assistance (GA) consumers.
                  The file shall include data on hospital claims paid by the
                  Contractor during the reporting month. The files shall include
                  data for three types of hospital services that are paid on a
                  capitated basis, as listed below:

                  o     Admissions to acute care hospitals
                  o     Admissions to rehabilitation hospitals
                  o     Outpatient hospital services, defined by the Department

                  The following types of information shall be included in each
                  record on the file:

                  o     Contractor
                  o     Provider
                  o     Consumer
                  o     Claim
                  o     Additional data elements as required.

                  Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in a
                  penalty equal to three (3) times the amount that applies to
                  other reporting requirements.

                  Additional Federalizing GA Data Reporting requirements can be
                  found in Exhibit CC of this Agreement, Data Support for
                  PH-MCOs.


                                                                             124
<PAGE>

            3.    Third Party Resource Identification

                  Third party resources identified by the Contractor, which do
                  not appear on the Department's TPL database, must be supplied
                  to the Department's TPL Section by the Contractor on a monthly
                  basis. The method of reporting shall be electronic submission
                  or hardcopy document, whichever is deemed most convenient and
                  efficient by the Contractor for its individual use. For
                  electronic submissions, the Contractor must follow the
                  required report format, data elements, and tape specifications
                  supplied by the Department. For hardcopy submissions, the
                  Contractor must use an exact replica of the TPL resource
                  referral form supplied by the Department.

      C.    Operations Reports

            The Contractor is required to submit such reports as specified by
            the Department to enable the Department to monitor the Contractor's
            internal operations and service delivery. These reports include, but

            1.    Continuous Quality Improvement

                  The Contractor agrees to provide the Department with uniform
                  data on services, QM, UM and Member satisfaction/complaint
                  data on a regular basis. All quality reports must be submitted
                  according to specifications defined by the Department. The
                  Contractor also agrees to cooperate with the Department in
                  carrying out data validation steps.

            2.    Federal Waiver Reporting Requirements

                  As a condition of approval of the Waiver for the operation of
                  HealthChoices in Pennsylvania, the Health Care Financing
                  Administration has imposed specific reporting requirements
                  related to the AIDS Home and Community Based Waiver and
                  special needs population, particularly related to special
                  needs services provided to children. The Contractor must
                  provide the information necessary to meet these reporting
                  requirements. To the extent possible the Department will
                  provide reasonable advance notice of such reports.

            3.    Complaint, Grievance and DPW Fair Hearing Data

                  The Contractor agrees to requirements governing the submission
                  of Complaint, Grievance and DPW Fair Hearing process data
                  found at


                                                                             125
<PAGE>

                  Section VIII.C.3 of this Agreement, Complaint, Grievance and
                  DPW Fair Hearing Data.

                  The Contractor agrees to submit a quarterly Complaint,
                  Grievance and DPW Fair Hearing process report no later than
                  forty-five (45) days from the end of the quarter that conforms
                  to the Department's and DOH's specifications and includes at a
                  minimum:

                  o     Total informal Complaints and Member informal Complaint
                        rate by medical nature of Complaint (quality of care,
                        days to appointment, specialist referral, request for
                        interpreter, denial of ER claim, etc.); and by
                        non-medical nature of Complaint (PH-MCO office staff,
                        office waiting time, etc.).

                  o     Total Grievances and Grievance rate using the indicators
                        in the bullet above.

                  o     Total Provider appeals by nature of grievance (quality
                        of care, denial of referral request, denial of claim,
                        lack of timely payment, etc.) and resolution.

                  The Contractor agrees to report its Provider appeal data and
                  utilization management outcomes to the Department utilizing
                  the standardized report form specified by the Department.

            4.    EPSDT Reports

                  The Contractor must submit EPSDT reports in the time and
                  manner prescribed by the Department. The Contractor shall be
                  responsible for maintaining appropriate systems and mechanisms
                  to obtain all necessary encounter data from its health care
                  Providers to ensure its ability to comply with the EPSDT
                  reporting requirements. The failure of a health care Provider
                  to provide the Contractor with necessary EPSDT encounter data
                  shall not excuse the Contractor's compliance with this
                  requirement.

                  The Contractor must submit reports providing all data
                  regarding children in substitute care (e.g., the number of
                  children enrolled in substitute care who have received

SECTION IX: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

      A.    Accuracy of Proposal

            The Contractor represents and warrants that the representations made
            to the Department in the Proposal are true and correct. The

            which arises or is discovered subsequent to the date of the
            Contractor's submission of the Proposal, which affects the truth,
            accuracy, or completeness of such representations.

                  has been debarred


                                                                             132

            must be submitted to BCABD which will make a recommendation as to a
            course of action to the contracting officer.

            If a contract is assigned to another contractor, the new contractor

                  consent by the PH-MCO which would gain that responsibility.
                  The Department will develop a transition plan should it choose
                  to terminate or not extend a contract with one (1) or more
                  PH-MCOs operating the HC-L/C Program.

                  During the final quarter of this Agreement, the Contractor
                  will work cooperatively with, and supply program information
                  to, any subsequent contractors. Both the program information
                  and the working relationship among the PH-MCOs will be defined
                  by the Department.

                  Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the
                  Contractor must:

                  a.    Provide the Department with all information deemed

                        through the date of discharge or thirty-one (31) days

                        in c. above, for which payment is denied by the

                        treatment of services requested prior to termination
                        which are subsequently overturned at a DPW Fair Hearing

                        patient records to those Providers who will be assuming
                        care for the Member. For those Members in a course of
                        treatment for which a change of providers could be
                        harmful, the Contractor must continue to provide
                        services on a FFS basis until that treatment is

            the Department to other parties except as required by law or except
            as may be determined by the Department to be related to the

                  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, their respective employees,
                  agents, and representatives free and harmless against any and
                  all liabilities, losses, settlements, claims, demands, and
                  expenses of any kind (including, but not limited to,
                  attorneys' fees) which may result or arise out of any dispute
                  of any kind by and between the


                                                                             142
<PAGE>

                  Contractor and its subcontractors with Members, agents,
                  clients, or any defamation, malpractice, fraud, negligence, or
                  intentional misconduct caused or alleged to have been caused
                  by the Contractor or its agents, subcontractors, employees, or
                  representatives in the performance or omission of any act or
                  responsibility assumed by the Contractor pursuant to this
                  Agreement.

            2.    The Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the
                  Department and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from any audit
                  disallowance imposed by the federal government resulting from
                  the Contractor's failure to follow state or federal rules,
                  regulations, or procedures unless prior authorization was
                  given by the Department. The Department shall provide timely
                  notice of any disallowance to the Contractor and allow the
                  Contractor an opportunity to participate in the disallowance
                  appeal process and any subsequent judicial review to the
                  extent permitted by law. Any payment required under this
                  provision shall be due from the Contractor upon notice from
                  the Department. The indemnification provision hereunder shall
                  not extend to disallowances which result from a determination
                  by the federal government that the terms of this Agreement are
                  not in accordance with federal law. The obligations under this
                  paragraph shall survive any termination or cancellation of
                  this Agreement.

      B.    Insurance

            The Contractor shall maintain for itself, each of its employees,
            agents, and representatives, general liability and all other types
            of insurance in such amounts as reasonably required by the
            Department and all applicable laws. In addition, the Contractor
            shall require that each of the health care professionals with which
            the Contractor contracts maintains professional malpractice and all
            other types of insurance in such amounts as required by all
            applicable laws. The Contractor shall provide to the Department,
            upon the Department's request, certificates evidencing such
            insurance coverage.

SECTION XVI: DISPUTES

      A.    In the event that a dispute arises between the parties relating to
            any matter regarding this Agreement, the Contractor shall send
            written notice of an initial level dispute to the Contracting
            Officer for this Agreement, who shall make a determination in
            writing of his/her interpretation and shall send the same to the
            Contractor within thirty (30) days of the Contractor's written
            request for same. That interpretation shall be final, conclusive,
            and binding on the Contractor, and unreviewable in all respects
            unless the Contractor within twenty (20) days of its receipt of said
            interpretation, delivers a written appeal to the Secretary of Public
            Welfare. Unless the


                                                                             143
<PAGE>

            Contractor consents to extend the time for disposition by the
            Secretary, the decision of the Secretary shall be released within
            thirty (30) days of the Contractor's written appeal and shall be
            final, conclusive, and binding, and the Contractor shall thereafter
            with good faith and diligence, render such performance in compliance
            with the Secretary's determination; subject to the provisions of
            Section XVIII.B below. Notice of initial level dispute shall be sent
            to:

            with Section XVI.A above. Resolution of disputes under this

            to the Contractor.

            Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or an act of any
            military or civil authority, outage of communications, power, or
            other utility, the Contractor shall cause its employees and all
            Providers to render all services provided for in the RFP and herein
            as is practical within the limits of Providers' facilities and
            available staff. The Contractor, however, shall not be liable nor
            deemed to be in default for any Provider's failure to provide
            services or for any delay in the provision of services when such a
            failure or delay is the direct or proximate result of the depletion
            of staff or facilities by the major disaster or epidemic, or act of
            any military or civil authority, outage of communications, power, or
            other utility; provided, however, in the event that the provision of
            services is substantially interrupted, the Department shall have the
            right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days written notice
            to the Contractor.

            services rendered by a health care practitioner during the period
            the Contractor knew, or should have known, such practitioner was
            suspended or terminated from the Medical Assistance Program of this
            or another state, or the Medicare Program.

      B.    Rights of the Department and the Contractor

            The rights and remedies of the Department provided herein shall not
            be exclusive and are in addition to any rights and remedies provided

            Disputes, the rights and remedies of the Contractor provided herein

            remedies provided by law.

      C.    Waiver

      D.    Invalid Provisions

            Any provision of this Agreement which is in violation of any state
            or federal law or regulation shall be deemed amended to conform with
            such law or regulation, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
            except that if such change would materially and substantially alter
            the obligations of the parties under this Agreement, any such
            provision shall be renegotiated by the parties. The invalidity or
            unenforceability of any terms or provisions hereof shall in no way
            affect the validity or enforceability of any other terms or
            provisions hereof.
