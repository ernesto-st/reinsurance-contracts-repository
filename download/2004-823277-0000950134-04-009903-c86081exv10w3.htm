its election at any time prior to Prudential&#146;s receipt thereof cancel the

sentence, Prudential (on behalf of each Purchaser) may at its election, at any
time after 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day,

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary appearing in this Agreement, the

Company and its Subsidiaries as at August&nbsp;31 in each of the three fiscal years
of the Company most recently completed prior to the date as of which this
representation is made or repeated to such Purchaser (other than fiscal years
completed within 90&nbsp;days prior to such date for which audited financial
statements have not been released) and consolidated statements of income and
cash flows and a consolidated statement of members&#146; equity of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for each such year, all reported on by either Deloitte &#038;
Touche, L.L.P. or Pricewaterhouse Coopers, LLP or other nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm and (ii)&nbsp;consolidated balance sheet of the

quarterly period in the preceding fiscal year and consolidated statements of
income and cash flows and a consolidated statement of members&#146; equity for the

are included to the end of such quarterly periods, prepared by the Company.
Such financial statements (including any related schedules and/or notes) are
true and correct in all material respects (subject, as to interim statements,
to changes resulting from audits and year-end adjustments), have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently
followed throughout the periods involved and show all liabilities, direct and
contingent, of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be shown in
accordance with such principles. The balance sheets fairly present the
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof, and the
statements of income, stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows fairly present the
results of the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their cash
flows for the periods indicated. There has been no material adverse change in
the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole since the end of the most recent fiscal year

Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in denominations of at
least $100,000, except as may be necessary to reflect any principal amount not
evenly divisible by $100,000. The Company shall keep at its principal office a
register in which the Company shall provide for the registration of Notes and
of transfers of Notes. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note
at the principal office of the Company, the Company shall, at its expense,
execute and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor and of a like aggregate
principal amount, registered in the name of such transferee or transferees. At
the option of the holder of any Note, such Note may be exchanged for other

principal amount, upon surrender of the Note to be exchanged at the principal
office of the Company. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the

making the exchange is entitled to receive. Each prepayment of principal
payable on each prepayment date upon each new Note issued upon any such
transfer or exchange shall be in the same proportion to the unpaid principal
amount of such new Note as the prepayment of principal payable on such date on
the Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange bore to the

in writing. Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or upon transfer
thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and interest to accrue which
were carried by the Note so exchanged or transferred, so that neither gain nor
loss of interest shall result from any such transfer or exchange. Upon receipt
of written notice from the holder of any Note of the loss, theft, destruction

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am general counsel of CHS Inc., a nonstock agricultural cooperative
corporation formerly known as Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives (the
&#147;Company&#148;), in connection with the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement,
dated as April&nbsp;13, 2004 (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) between the Company, on one hand, and
Prudential Investment Management, Inc., the Initial Purchasers named in the
Purchaser Schedule attached thereto and each Prudential Affiliate which becomes
a party thereto, on the other hand, pursuant to which the Company has issued to
you today its 4.08% Senior Series&nbsp;F Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$15,000,000 and 4.39% Senior Series&nbsp;G Notes in the aggregate principal amount
of $15,000,000 (collectively, the &#147;Notes&#148;). Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings provided in the Agreement.
This letter is being delivered to you in satisfaction of the condition set
forth in paragraph 3A(iii) of the Agreement and with the understanding that you
are purchasing the Notes in reliance on the opinions expressed herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I have examined such certificates of public officials,
certificates of officers of the Company and copies certified to my satisfaction
of corporate documents and records of the Company and of other papers, and have
made such other investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a
basis for my opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied upon such
certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company with respect to
the accuracy of material factual matters contained therein which were not
independently established. With respect to the opinion expressed in paragraph
3 below, I have also relied upon the representation made by you in paragraph 9A
of the Agreement. For purposes of this opinion, I have assumed that you have
all requisite power and authority and have taken all necessary action to
execute and deliver the Agreement and to effect the transactions contemplated
thereby.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The Company is a nonstock agricultural cooperative corporation duly
organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Minnesota. The Company has the corporate power to carry on its business as
now being conducted.

corporate action and duly executed and delivered by authorized officers of the
Company, and are valid obligations of the Company, legally binding upon and
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by (a)&nbsp;bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146;
rights generally and (b)&nbsp;general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;It is not necessary in connection with the offering, issuance, sale and
delivery of the Notes under the circumstances contemplated by the Agreement to
register the Notes under the Securities Act or to qualify an indenture in
respect of the Notes under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;The extension, arranging and obtaining of the credit represented by the

our knowledge any agreement (including, without limitation, any agreement
