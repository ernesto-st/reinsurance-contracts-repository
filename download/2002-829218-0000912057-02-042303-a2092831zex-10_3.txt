          2.1    REVOLVING CREDIT BORROWING.

          (a)    REVOLVING COMMITMENTS. Each Revolving Lender, severally and for
itself alone, hereby agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth and in reliance upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, to make loans to the Borrowers
on a revolving basis from time to time during the Commitment Period, in an
amount not to exceed its Available Revolving Commitment after giving effect to
the use of proceeds thereof and of any other Loan made prior thereto or
simultaneously therewith on the applicable borrowing date (each such loan by any
Lender, a "REVOLVING LOAN" and collectively, the "REVOLVING LOANS"); PROVIDED,
that all Revolving Loans comprising the same Borrowing hereunder shall be made
by the Revolving Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their respective
Revolving Commitments; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that after giving effect to any
Borrowing of Revolving Loans, the outstanding principal balance of all Revolving
Loans and the Stated Amount of all outstanding LC Obligations may not exceed the
Borrowing Base. Prior to the Commitment Termination Date, Revolving Loans may be
repaid and reborrowed by the Borrowers in accordance with the provisions hereof.

          (b)    REVOLVING LOANS. The Revolving Loans may from time to time be
(i) Eurodollar Loans, (ii) Base Rate Loans, or (iii) a combination thereof, as
determined by the Funds Administrator and notified to Administrative Agent in
accordance with SECTION 2.1(d); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that at no time shall there
be outstanding more than ten (10) Borrowings of Eurocurrency Loans which are
part of the Revolving Loans; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that no Revolving Loan
shall be made as a Eurodollar Loan after the day that is one month prior to the
Commitment Termination Date. All Revolving Loans shall be made in Dollars.

          (c)    REVOLVING NOTES. The Revolving Loans made by each Revolving
Lender shall, if requested by such Revolving Lender, be evidenced by a
promissory note substantially in

                                       43
<Page>

the form of EXHIBIT 2.1(c), with appropriate insertions as to payee, date and
principal amount (a "REVOLVING NOTE"), payable to the order of such Lender. Each
Revolving Lender is hereby authorized to record the date, Type and amount of
each Revolving Loan made by such Lender, each continuation thereof, each
conversion of all or a portion thereof to another Type, the date and amount of
each payment or prepayment of principal thereof and, in the case of Eurodollar
Loans, the length of each Interest Period with respect thereto, on the schedule
annexed to and constituting a part of its Revolving Note (or otherwise on the
records of such Lender), and any such recordation shall (in the absence of
manifest error) constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the
information so recorded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of a Lender to make
any such recordation (or any error in such recordation) on its records or on its
Revolving Note shall not affect the obligations of the Borrowers thereunder or
under this Agreement. Each Revolving Note shall (x) be dated the Closing Date,
(y) be stated to mature on the Commitment Termination Date and (z) provide for
the payment of interest in accordance with SECTION 3.1.

          (d)    PROCEDURE FOR REVOLVING CREDIT BORROWING. Borrowings shall be
made on notice from the Funds Administrator to the Administrative Agent (x)
prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time), three Business Days prior to the
requested borrowing date, if all or any part of the requested Revolving Loans
are to be Eurodollar Loans and (y) prior to 2:00 P.M. (New York City time), on
the Business Day of the requested borrowing date, with respect to Borrowings of
Base Rate Loans, specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed, (ii) the requested
borrowing date, (iii) whether the Borrowing is to be of Eurodollar Loans, Base
Rate Loans, or a combination thereof and (iv) if the Borrowing is to be entirely
or partly of Eurodollar Loans, the respective amounts of each such Type of Loan
and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Periods therefor. Each
Borrowing under the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount equal to or in
excess of (x) in the case of Base Rate Loans, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)
(or, if less, the then Total Available Revolving Commitment) and (y) in the case
of Eurodollar Loans, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
any Borrowing of Revolving Loans to be used solely to pay the aggregate amount
of the drawing on any Letter of Credit pursuant to SECTION 2.3 (c) may be in the
amount of such drawing. Such Borrowing will then be made available to Borrowers
by 4:00 P.M. (New York City time) by Administrative Agent's crediting the
account or accounts of Borrowers designated by the Funds Administrator on the
books of such office with the aggregate of the Loans.

                 (i)    Each Notice of Borrowing shall be given by,
          alternatively, telephone, facsimile or electronic E-mail transmission,
          and, if by telephone or electronic E-mail transmission, confirmed in
          writing on the same Business Day to the extent requested by
          Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 2.1(d) (the
          "NOTICE OF BORROWING"). Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable
          by and binding on the Funds Administrator and the Borrowers.

                 (ii)   The Funds Administrator shall notify the Administrative
          Agent in writing of the names of the officers of the Funds
          Administrator authorized to request Loans on behalf of the Borrowers
          and specifying which of those officers are also, or, if none are, the
          other officers that are, authorized to direct the disbursement of
          Loans in a manner contrary to standing disbursement instructions, and
          shall provide the Administrative Agent with a specimen

                                       44
<Page>

          signature of each such officer. In the absence of a specification of
          those officers who are authorized to vary standing disbursement
          instructions, the Administrative Agent may assume that each officer
          authorized to request Loans also has such authority. The
          Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
          authority of such officers of the Funds Administrator to request Loans
          on behalf of the Borrowers, or to vary standing disbursement
          instructions, until the Administrative Agent receives written notice
          to the contrary. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to verify
          the authenticity of the signature appearing on any Notice of Borrowing
          or other writing delivered pursuant to this SECTION 2.1(d) and, with
          respect to an oral or electronic E-mail request for Loans, the
          Administrative Agent shall have no duty to verify the identity of any
          individual representing himself as one of the officers of the Funds
          Administrator authorized to make such request on behalf of the
          Borrowers. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Lenders
          shall incur any liability to the Funds Administrator or any of the
          Borrowers as a result of (A) acting upon any telephonic or electronic
          E-mail notice referred to in this SECTION 2.1(d) if the Administrative
          Agent believes in good faith such notice to have been given by a duly
          authorized officer of the Funds Administrator or other individual
          authorized to request Loans on behalf of the Borrowers or to direct
          the disbursement thereof in a manner contrary to standing disbursement
          instructions, or (B) otherwise acting in good faith under this SECTION
          2.1(d) and an advance made and disbursed pursuant to any such
          telephonic or electronic E-mail notice shall be deemed to be a Loan
          for all purposes of this Agreement.

          (e)    In addition to being evidenced by the Borrowers' Accounts, each
Lender's Loans and the Borrowers' joint and several obligations to repay such
Loans with interest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
evidenced by this Agreement, the records of such Lender and such Lender's Note.
The records of each Lender shall be prima facie evidence of such Lender's Loans
and accrued interest thereon and of all payments made in respect thereof.

          (f)    Each Lender shall be entitled to earn interest at the then
applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with ARTICLE III, on
outstanding Loans which it has funded to the Administrative Agent; PROVIDED that
in the case of interest accrued but unpaid at the time of a Bankruptcy Event and
interest accruing thereafter and during a Bankruptcy Event, such Lender shall be
entitled to receive only its Revolving Pro Rata Share of amounts actually
received by the Administrative Agent in respect of such interest; FURTHER
PROVIDED that if any amount received by the Administrative Agent in respect of
such interest and distributed by it is thereafter recovered from the
Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, upon request, repay to the
Administrative Agent its Revolving Pro Rata Share of the amount so recovered to
the extent received by it, but without interest (unless the Administrative Agent
is required to pay interest on the amount recovered, in which case such Lender
shall be required to pay interest at a like rate).

          (g)    Notwithstanding the obligation of the Funds Administrator to
send written confirmation of a Notice of Borrowing made by telephone or
electronic E-mail transmission if and when requested by the Administrative
Agent, in the event that the Administrative Agent

                                       45
<Page>

agrees to accept a Notice of Borrowing made by telephone or electronic E-mail
transmission, such Notice of Borrowing shall be binding on the Funds
Administrator and each Borrower whether or not written confirmation is sent by
the Funds Administrator or requested by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may act prior to the receipt of any requested written
confirmation, without any liability whatsoever, based upon telephonic or
electronic E-mail notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to
be from the Funds Administrator or its agents. The Administrative Agent's
records of the terms of any telephonic or electronic E-mail transmission Notices
of Borrowing shall be conclusive on the Funds Administrator, each Borrower and
the Lenders in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part
of the Administrative Agent in connection therewith.

          2.2    CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION ELECTIONS FOR EURODOLLAR LOANS AND
BASE RATE LOANS.

          (a)    The Funds Administrator may upon notice to Administrative Agent
in accordance with SECTION 2.2(b):

                 (i)    elect to convert on any Business Day, any Base Rate
     Loans (or any part thereof in an aggregate amount not less than One Million
     Dollars ($1,000,000)), into Eurodollar Loans; or

                 (ii)   elect to convert on a Conversion Date any Eurodollar
     Loans (or any part thereof in an aggregate amount not less than One Million
     Dollars ($1,000,000)) into Base Rate Loans; or

                 (iii)  elect to continue on a Continuation Date any Eurodollar
     Loans (or any part thereof in an aggregate amount not less than One Million
     Dollars ($1,000,000));

     PROVIDED, that if the aggregate amount of all Eurodollar Loans shall have
     been reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of part thereof to an
     amount less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), the Eurodollar Loans
     shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans, on the last day of such
     Interest Period.

          (b)    If the Funds Administrator desires to convert or continue any
Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate Loan pursuant to SECTION 2.2(a), it shall
irrevocably request a conversion or continuation (if by telephone, to be
confirmed promptly in writing) in a Notice of Conversion or Continuation in the
form of EXHIBIT 2.2(b) (a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION") to be received
by Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least
(i) three Business Days in advance of the Conversion Date or Continuation Date,
if the Loans are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Loans; and (ii)
on the same Business Day as the Conversion Date, if the Loans are to be
converted into Base Rate Loans, specifying:

                 (A)    the proposed Conversion Date or Continuation Date;

                 (B)    the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate
     Loans to be converted or continued;

                                       46
<Page>

                 (C)    the nature of the proposed conversion or continuation;
     and

                 (D)    the duration of the requested Interest Period, if the
     Loans are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Loans.

          (c)    If prior to the time set forth in SECTION 2.2(b), (i) the Funds
Administrator has failed to give a timely Notice of Conversion or Continuation
with respect to a Eurodollar Loan, or (ii) the Funds Administrator has failed to
select a new Interest Period to be applicable to a Eurodollar Loan, the Funds
Administrator shall be deemed to have elected to continue such loan as a Base
Rate Loan.

          (d)    Upon receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation,
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender thereof, or, if
no timely notice is provided, Administrative Agent will promptly notify each
applicable Lender of the details of any automatic conversion or continuation.
All conversions and continuations pursuant to this SECTION 2.2 shall be made pro
rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans
being converted or continued held by each Lender.

          (e)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Funds Administrator shall
not be entitled to specify or elect in any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion or Continuation that any Loans shall be or become Eurodollar Loans if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing unless the Required
Lenders shall have notified Administrative Agent that additional Eurodollar
Loans shall be made available while such Event of Default is continuing. If an
Event of Default shall occur and be continuing then, unless Administrative Agent
shall receive such notice from the Required Lenders or all Events of Default
have been cured or waived, each outstanding Eurodollar Loan shall be converted
to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of its Interest Period and any additional
Revolving Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans. The foregoing is without
prejudice to the other rights and remedies available hereunder upon an Event of
Default.

     own name, but for the ratable benefit of all Revolving Lenders having a
     Revolving Commitment (including the applicable Facing Bank), one or more
     Letters of Credit, each having a Stated Amount in Dollars and payable on a
     sight basis, for the joint and several account of the Borrowers in a Stated
     Amount which together with the aggregate Stated Amount of other Letters of
     Credit then outstanding does not exceed $40,000,000 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
     a Facing Bank shall not issue or extend the expiration of any Letter of
     Credit if, immediately after giving effect to such issuance or extension,
     (A) the aggregate LC Obligations at such time would exceed $40,000,000 or
     (B) the Total Available Revolving Commitment would be less than zero

                                       47
<Page>

     or (C) if after such issuance the sum of the principal balances of all
     outstanding Revolving Loans and the sum of all LC Obligations would exceed
     the Borrowing Base. Each Revolving Lender having a Revolving Commitment
     severally, but not jointly, agrees to participate in each such Letter of
     Credit issued by the applicable Facing Bank in an amount equal to its
     Revolving Pro Rata Share and to make available to the applicable Facing
     Bank such Revolving Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of any payment made
     to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit to the extent not reimbursed by
     the Borrowers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Revolving Lender shall be
     required to participate in any Letter of Credit to the extent that such
     participation therein would exceed such Revolving Lender's Available
     Revolving Commitment then in effect. No Revolving Lender's obligation to
     participate in any Letter of Credit or to make available to the applicable
     Facing Bank such Revolving Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of any Letter
     of Credit Payment made by the applicable Facing Bank shall be affected by
     any other Revolving Lender's failure to participate in the same or any
     other Letter of Credit or by any other Revolving Lender's failure to make
     available to the applicable Facing Bank such other Revolving Lender's
     Revolving Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Payment.

                 (ii)   Each Letter of Credit issued or to be issued hereunder
     shall have an expiration date not later than thirty (30) days before the
     Commitment Termination Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Standby Letter of
     Credit may provide by its terms that it will be automatically extended for
     additional successive periods not in excess of one (1) year unless the
     applicable Facing Bank shall have given notice to the applicable
     beneficiary (with a copy to the Funds Administrator) of the election by the
     applicable Facing Bank (such election to be in the sole and absolute
     discretion of the applicable Facing Bank) not to extend such Letter of
     Credit, such notice to be given not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
     then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit; PROVIDED, FURTHER,
     that no Standby Letter of Credit or extension thereof shall be stated to
     expire later than the Commitment Termination Date.

          (b)    PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE AND AMENDMENT OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.
Whenever the Funds Administrator desires the issuance of a Letter of Credit
hereunder, it shall give Administrative Agent and the applicable Facing Bank at
least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice (or such shorter period as
may be agreed to by the Funds Administrator, Administrative Agent and the
applicable Facing Bank) specifying the day of issuance thereof (which day shall
be a Business Day), such notice to be given prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City
time) on the date specified for the giving of such notice. Each such notice
(each, a "LETTER OF CREDIT REQUEST") shall be in the form of EXHIBIT 2.3(b)
hereto and shall specify (A) the proposed issuance date and expiration date, (B)
the name(s) of each obligor with respect to such Letter of Credit, (C) the
Borrowers as the account party, (D) the name and address of the beneficiary and
(E) the Stated Amount of such proposed Letter of Credit and such other
information as Facing Bank may reasonably request. In addition, each Letter of
Credit Request shall contain a description of the terms and conditions to be
included in such proposed Letter of Credit (all of which terms and conditions
shall be acceptable in form to the applicable Facing Bank). Promptly after
issuance or extension of any Letter of Credit, the applicable Facing Bank shall
notify Administrative Agent of such issuance or extension and such notice shall
be accompanied by a copy of the issued Letter of Credit. Unless otherwise
specified, all Letters of

                                       48
<Page>

Credit will be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary
Credits as in effect on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit. On the
Business Day specified by the Funds Administrator and upon confirmation from
Administrative Agent that the applicable conditions set forth in ARTICLE V have
been fulfilled or waived, the applicable Facing Bank will issue the requested
Letter of Credit to the applicable beneficiary. Promptly after the issuance or
amendment of a Letter of Credit, the Facing Bank shall notify the Administrative
Agent and the Funds Administrator, in writing, of such issuance or amendment and
such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such issuance or amendment. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Revolving Lenders, in writing, of such issuance or amendment and if requested by
a Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent shall provide such Revolving Lender
with copies of such issuance or amendment. From time to time while a Letter of
Credit is outstanding and prior to the Commitment Termination Date, the
applicable Facing Bank will, upon the written request of the Funds Administrator
received by the Facing Bank (with a copy sent by the Funds Administrator to
Administrative Agent) at least three days (or such shorter time as the Facing
Bank and Administrative Agent may agree in a particular instance in its sole
discretion) prior to the proposed date of amendment, amend any Letter of Credit
issued by it (a "LETTER OF CREDIT AMENDMENT"). Each such request for a Letter of
Credit Amendment shall be made by facsimile, confirmed immediately in an
original writing (each a "LETTER OF CREDIT AMENDMENT REQUEST") and shall specify
in form and detail satisfactory to the Facing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to
be amended; (ii) the proposed date of amendment of the Letter of Credit (which
shall be a Business Day); (iii) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (iv)
such other matters as the Facing Bank may require. The Facing Bank shall be
under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if: (A) the Facing Bank would
have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended
form under the terms of this Agreement, or (B) the beneficiary of any such
Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.

          (c)    DRAWS UPON LETTERS OF CREDIT; REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION. In the
event of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the
applicable Facing Bank shall give telephonic notice to the Funds Administrator
and Administrative Agent (x) confirming such drawing and (y) of the date on or
before such Facing Bank intends to honor such drawing, and the Borrowers shall
reimburse the applicable Facing Bank on the day on which such drawing is honored
in an amount in same day funds and like currency equal to the amount and
currency of such drawing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless the Funds Adminstrator
shall have notified Administrative Agent and the applicable Facing Bank prior to
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day the applicable Facing Bank
intends to honor such drawing that the Borrowers intend to reimburse the
applicable Facing Bank for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the
proceeds of Revolving Loans, the Funds Administrator shall be deemed to have
timely given a Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent requesting each
Revolving Lender having a Revolving Commitment to make Revolving Loans which are
Base Rate Loans on the date on which such drawing is honored in an amount equal
to the amount of such drawing and Administrative Agent shall, if such Notice of
Borrowing is deemed given, promptly notify the Revolving Lenders thereof and
(ii) unless any of the events described in SECTIONS 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) shall
have occurred (in which event the procedures of SECTION 2.3(d) shall apply),
each such Lender shall, on the date of such drawing, make Revolving Loans which
are Base Rate Loans in the amount of

                                       49
<Page>

its Revolving Pro Rata Share of such drawing, the proceeds of which shall be
applied directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Facing Bank
for the amount of such drawing; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, if for any reason,
proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by the applicable Facing Bank on
such date in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing, the Borrowers shall
reimburse the applicable Facing Bank, on the Business Day immediately following
the date of such drawing, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of
the amount of such drawing over the amount of such Revolving Loans, if any,
which are so received, plus accrued interest on such amount at the rate set
forth in SECTION 3.1(a).

          (d)    LENDERS' PARTICIPATION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT. In the event that
the Borrowers shall fail to reimburse the applicable Facing Bank as provided in
SECTION 2.3(c) in an amount equal to the amount of any drawing honored by the
applicable Facing Bank under a Letter of Credit issued by it in accordance with
the terms hereof, the applicable Facing Bank shall promptly notify
Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Revolving Lender having a Revolving Commitment of the unreimbursed amount of
such drawing and of such Lender's respective participation therein. Each such
Lender shall purchase a participation interest in such LC Obligation and shall
make available to the applicable Facing Bank an amount equal to its Revolving
Pro Rata Share of such drawing in same day funds, at the office of the
applicable Facing Bank specified in such notice, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the Business Day after the date such Revolving Lender is
notified by Administrative Agent. In the event that any such Lender fails to
make available to the applicable Facing Bank the amount of such Revolving
Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this SECTION
2.3(d), the applicable Facing Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on
demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest at the Federal Funds
Rate for two Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing in this
SECTION 2.3(d) shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Revolving Lender to
recover from the applicable Facing Bank any amounts made available by such
Revolving Lender to the applicable Facing Bank pursuant to this SECTION 2.3(d)
in the event that it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
payment with respect to a Letter of Credit by the applicable Facing Bank in
respect of which payment was made by such Revolving Lender constituted gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Facing Bank. The
applicable Facing Bank shall distribute to each other Revolving Lender which has
paid all amounts payable by it under this SECTION 2.3(d) with respect to any
Letter of Credit issued by the applicable Facing Bank such other Revolving
Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of all payments received by the applicable
Facing Bank from Borrower in reimbursement of drawings honored by the applicable
Facing Bank under such Letter of Credit when such payments are received. Each
Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to SECTION 2.3(c)
or to purchase participations pursuant to SECTION 2.3(d) as a result of a
drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional and without
recourse to the Facing Bank and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Revolving Lender may have against the Facing Bank, the Borrower or
any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance
of a Default, an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) any
other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing.

          (e)    FEES FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                                       50
<Page>

                 (i)    FACING BANK FEES. The Company agrees to pay the
     following amount to the applicable Facing Bank (or with respect to clause
     (A) below, to Administrative Agent for distribution to each participating
     Revolving Lender) with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it for the
     account of the Borrowers:

                 (A)    with respect to drawings made under any Letter of
     Credit, interest, payable on demand, on the dollar equivalent of the amount
     paid by the applicable Facing Bank in respect of each such drawing from the
     date of the drawing through the date such amount is reimbursed by the
     Borrowers (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of
     Revolving Loans pursuant to SECTION 2.3(c)) at a rate which is at all times
     equal to the Applicable Eurocurrency Rate Margin per annum in excess of the
     Base Rate;

                 (B)    with respect to the issuance or amendment of each Letter
     of Credit and each drawing made thereunder, documentary and processing
     charges in accordance with the applicable Facing Bank's standard schedule
     for such charges in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment,
     transfer or drawing, as the case may be; and

                 (C)    such other fees to be paid as separately agreed to in a
     fee letter between the Borrowers and the Facing Bank.

                 (ii)   PARTICIPATING LENDER FEES. The Borrowers agree to pay to
     Administrative Agent for distribution to each participating Revolving
     Lender in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding such Revolving
     Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of a commission equal to the Applicable
     Eurocurrency Margin per annum with respect to the maximum Stated Amount
     under such outstanding Letters of Credit (the "LC COMMISSION"), payable in
     arrears on the last Business Day of March, June, September and December, on
     the Commitment Termination Date and thereafter, on demand. The LC
     Commission shall be computed from the first day of issuance of each Letter
     of Credit and on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
     of 360 days.

          Promptly upon receipt by a Facing Bank or Administrative Agent of any
amount described in clause (i)(A) or (ii) of this SECTION 2.5(e), the applicable
Facing Bank or Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Revolving Lender,
its Revolving Pro Rata Share of such amount as long as, in the case of amounts
described in clause (i)(A), such Revolving Lender has reimbursed the applicable
Facing Bank in accordance with SECTION 2.5(d). Amounts payable under clause
(i)(B) and (C) of this SECTION 2.5(e) shall be paid directly to the applicable
Facing Bank.

          (f)    LC OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligation of the Borrowers
to reimburse a Facing Bank (or any Revolving Lender that has purchased a
participation from or made a Loan to enable the Borrowers to reimburse the
applicable Facing Bank) for drawings made under any Letter of Credit issued by
it and the obligations of each Revolving Lender under SECTION 2.5(d) with
respect thereto shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances,
including, without limitation, the following circumstances:

                                       51
<Page>

                 (i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of
     Credit;

                 (ii)   the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
     right which any Borrower or any of such Borrower's Affiliates may have at
     any time against a beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit
     (or any persons or entities for which any such beneficiary or transferee
     may be acting), the applicable Facing Bank, any Lender or any other Person,
     whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
     herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction
     between any Borrower or one of such Borrower's Subsidiaries and the
     beneficiary of such Letter of Credit);

                 (iii)  any draft, demand, certificate or any other document
     presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
     invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
     untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

                 (iv)   payment by the applicable Facing Bank under such Letter
     of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other
     document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                 (v)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
     or not similar to any of the foregoing; or

                 (vi)   the fact that an Event of Default or an Unmatured Event
     of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Borrower nor the Revolving Lenders (other than
the applicable Facing Bank in its capacity as such) shall be liable for any
obligation resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
applicable Facing Bank with respect to any Letter of Credit.

          (g)    INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere
provided in this Agreement, the Borrowers hereby agree to protect, indemnify,
pay and save the applicable Facing Bank harmless from and against any and all
claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) (other than for Taxes, which shall be covered by
SECTION 4.8) which the applicable Facing Bank may incur or be subject to as a
consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of the Letters of Credit,
other than as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
applicable Facing Bank or (ii) the failure of the applicable Facing Bank to
honor a drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omissions,
whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto
Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "GOVERNMENT
ACTS") other than as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the applicable Facing Bank. As between the Borrowers on the one hand, and the
applicable Facing Bank and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Borrowers jointly
and severally assume all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the
Letters of Credit issued by the applicable Facing Bank by, the respective
beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, neither the applicable Facing Bank nor any of the Lenders shall
be responsible, in the absence of

                                       52
<Page>

gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final and
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) for the form,
validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document
submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of or
any drawing under such Letters of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be
in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;
(ii) for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning
or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary
of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order
to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or
delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph,
telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) for errors in
interpretation of technical terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing
under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; and (viii) for any consequences
arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Facing Bank, including,
without limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall affect, impair,
or prevent the vesting of any of the applicable Facing Bank's or any Lender's
rights or powers hereunder.

          In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific
provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the applicable
Facing Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or
the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the
applicable Facing Bank under any resulting liability to the Borrowers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Borrowers shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the applicable
Facing Bank in respect of any claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses,
costs, charges or expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the applicable
Facing Bank arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the applicable Facing Bank. The right of indemnification in the first paragraph
of this SECTION 2.3(g) shall not prejudice any rights that the Borrowers may
otherwise have against the applicable Facing Bank with respect to a Letter of
Credit issued hereunder.

          (h)    STATED AMOUNT. The Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall
not be less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) or such lesser amount
to which the applicable Facing Bank has agreed. For purposes of calculating the
Stated Amount of any Letter of Credit at any time:

                 (i)    any increase in the Stated Amount of any Letter of
     Credit by reason of any amendment to any Letter of Credit shall be deemed
     effective under this Agreement as of the date the applicable Facing Bank
     actually issues an amendment purporting to increase the Stated Amount of
     such Letter of Credit, whether or not the applicable Facing Bank receives
     the consent of the Letter of Credit beneficiary or beneficiaries to the
     amendment, except that if the Funds Administrator has requested that the
     increase in Stated Amount be given effect as of an earlier date and the
     applicable Facing Bank issues an amendment to that effect, then such
     increase in Stated Amount shall be deemed effective under this Agreement as
     of such earlier date requested by the Funds Administrator; PROVIDED that
     any increase in the Stated Amount shall be subject to

                                       53
<Page>

     the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in SECTION 5.2 and
     the applicable Facing Bank shall promptly notify the other Lenders of any
     such increase; and

                 (ii)   any reduction in the Stated Amount of any Letter of
     Credit by reason of any amendment to any Letter of Credit shall be deemed
     effective under this Agreement as of the later of (x) the date the
     applicable Facing Bank actually issues an amendment purporting to reduce
     the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amendment
     provides that the reduction be given effect as of an earlier date, or (y)
     the date the applicable Facing Bank receives the written consent (including
     by telex or facsimile transmission) of the Letter of Credit beneficiary or
     beneficiaries to such reduction, which written consent must be dated on or
     after the date of the amendment issued by the applicable Facing Bank
     purporting to effect such reduction.

          (i)    INCREASED COSTS. If at any time after the date hereof any
Facing Bank or any Lender determines that the introduction of or any change in
any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, guideline or request or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the
applicable Facing Bank or such Lender with any request or directive by any such
authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall either (i) impose,
modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar
requirement against letters of credit issued by the applicable Facing Bank or
participated in by any Lender, or (ii) impose on the applicable Facing Bank or
any Lender any other conditions relating, directly or indirectly, to the
provisions of this Agreement relating to Letters of Credit or any Letter of
Credit; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the
applicable Facing Bank or any Lender of issuing, maintaining or participating in
any Letter of Credit, or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
the applicable Facing Bank or any Lender hereunder or reduce the rate of return
on its capital with respect to Letters of Credit, then, upon demand to the
Borrowers by the applicable Facing Bank or any Lender (a copy of which demand
shall be sent by the applicable Facing Bank or such Lender to Administrative
Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to the applicable Facing Bank or such Lender, as
the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the
applicable Facing Bank or such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in
the amount receivable or reduction on the rate of return on its capital. In
determining such additional amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
applicable Facing Bank or such Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and
will, to the extent the increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable or
reductions in rates of return relate to Facing Bank's or such Lender's letters
of credit in general and are not specifically attributable to the Letters of
Credit hereunder, use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and
which cover all letters of credit similar to the Letters of Credit issued by or
participated in by the applicable Facing Bank or such Lender whether or not the
documentation for such other Letters of Credit permit the applicable Facing Bank
or such Lender to receive amounts of the type described in this SECTION 2.3(i).
The applicable Facing Bank or any Lender, upon determining that any additional
amounts will be payable pursuant to this SECTION 2.3(i), will give prompt
written notice thereof to the Funds Administrator, which notice shall include a
certificate submitted to Borrower by the applicable Facing Bank or such Lender
(a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the applicable Facing Bank or such
Lender to Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for the calculation of such additional amount or amounts necessary to

                                       54
<Page>

compensate the applicable Facing Bank or such Lender, although failure to give
any such notice shall not release or diminish Borrowers' obligations to pay
additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION 2.3(i); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the
applicable Facing Bank or such Lender, as applicable, has intentionally withheld
or delayed such notice, the applicable Facing Bank or such Lender, as the case
may be, shall not be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this
SECTION 2.3(i) for periods occurring prior to the 180th day before the giving of
such notice. The certificate required to be delivered pursuant to this SECTION
2.3(i) shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding on the
Funds Administrator and each of the Borrowers.

          (j)    EXISTING LETTERS OF CREDIT. SCHEDULE 2.3(j) sets forth all
letters of credit of the Borrowers issued by Facing Bank each of which shall be
deemed Letters of Credit under this Agreement and shall count against the
$40,000,000 limit on Letters of Credit as set forth in SECTION 2.3(a)(i). Each
Lender shall be deemed, without further action of any party hereto, to have
purchased from the Facing Bank a participation interest equal to its Revolving
Pro Rata Share of such Letters of Credit.

          2.4    MASTER COLLECTION ACCOUNT.

          (a)    On the Closing Date, the Collateral Agent shall establish in
its own name, for the benefit of the Secured Parties under the Security
Agreement, the Master Collection Account into which all Collections received in
any Lock-Box Account or otherwise received by any Credit Party are to be
remitted. The Master Collection Account shall be established and maintained at
DB or such other bank approved by Administrative Agent (such a bank, an
"ELIGIBLE INSTITUTION") or as a segregated trust account in the corporate trust
department of any federal or state chartered depository institution subject to
regulations regarding fiduciary funds on deposit substantially similar to 12
C.F.R. Section 9.10(b). The Master Collection Account shall bear a designation
clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of
the Collateral Agent. If the Master Collection Account is at any time maintained
with an Eligible Institution (other than as a segregated trust account in such
institution's corporate trust department as described above) and such
institution shall cease to be an Eligible Institution for purposes hereof,
Collateral Agent shall direct the Borrowers to, and the Borrowers shall, within
ten (10) calendar days thereafter, move such accounts to a different Eligible
Institution or to a segregated trust account maintained in the corporate trust
department of an institution meeting the qualifications set forth above. Subject
to the restrictions set forth in this SECTION 2.4(b), Collateral Agent shall
have the right at any time to move, or to designate any other account as, Master
Collection Account, and the Borrowers hereby agree to take any and all action
reasonably requested by Collateral Agent to facilitate any such move or
designation.

          (b)    The Borrowers hereby agree that they shall have no right of
setoff against, and no right otherwise to deduct from, any funds held in the
Master Collection Account for any amount owed to them by the Collateral Agent,
Administrative Agent, any of the Lenders, or any of the Credit Parties.

          (c)    So long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing and no Loan is outstanding, the Collateral Agent,
at the direction of the Funds Administrator, may invest the amounts from time to
time on deposit in the Master

                                       55
<Page>

Collection Account in an interest-bearing deposit account or, subject to the
approval of Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, in other overnight
investments constituting Permitted Investments. In no event shall the Collateral
Agent, Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders be liable for any losses
incurred on such investments, including as a result of any early termination of
such investments as aforesaid.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                INTEREST AND FEES

          3.1    INTEREST.

          (a)    REVOLVING LOANS. Subject to SECTIONS 3.1(d) and (e), each
Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof
from the date when made until it becomes due or is prepaid in full at a rate per
annum equal to (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, the Base Rate PLUS the
Applicable Base Rate Margin or (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the
Eurocurrency Rate PLUS the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin.

          (b)    PAYMENT OF INTEREST. Interest on each Loan shall be payable in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that interest accruing
hereunder including, but not limited to, that payable pursuant to SECTION 3.1(d)
shall be payable from time to time on demand of Administrative Agent or the
Required Lenders.

          (c)    NOTIFICATION OF RATE. Administrative Agent, upon determining
the interest rate for any Tranche of Eurocurrency Loans for any Interest Period,
shall promptly notify the Funds Administrator and the applicable Lenders
thereof. Such determination shall, absent manifest error and subject to SECTION
3.5, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto.

          (d)    DEFAULT INTEREST. Notwithstanding the rates of interest
specified herein, effective on the date 30 days after the occurrence and
continuance during such 30 day period of any Event of Default (other than the
failure to pay Obligations when due) and for so long thereafter as any such
Event of Default shall be continuing, and effective immediately upon any failure
to pay any Obligations or any other amounts due under any of the Loan Documents
when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, the principal balance of each
Loan then outstanding and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any
interest payment on each Loan not paid when due or other amounts then due and
payable, shall bear interest payable on demand, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

          (e)    MAXIMUM INTEREST. If any interest payment or other charge or
fee payable hereunder exceeds the maximum amount then permitted by applicable
law, the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the maximum amount then permitted
by applicable law and the Borrowers shall continue to pay the maximum amount
from time to time permitted by applicable law until all such interest payments
and other charges and fees otherwise due hereunder (in the absence of such
restraint imposed by applicable law) have been paid in full.

          3.2    FEES.

          (a)    COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrowers shall pay in Dollars to
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Lenders, a
commitment fee on the sum of the Total Available Revolving Commitment of the
Lenders in effect for each day, at a rate per annum equal to 0.75%; PROVIDED
that if the Total Available Revolving Commitment of the Lenders on a given day
is less than 50% of the Total Revolving Commitments, then the rate per annum
applicable to such day shall be 0.50%. Such commitment fee shall accrue from the
Closing Date to the Commitment Termination Date and shall be payable quarterly,
in arrears, on the last Business Day of each Fiscal Quarter (or if such day is
not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day), and on the
Commitment Termination Date.

          (b)    AGENCY FEES. The Company shall pay to Administrative Agent for
its own account, agency and other Loan fees in the amount and at the times set
forth in the letter agreements between the Company and Administrative Agent.

          3.3    COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Interest on all Eurocurrency
Loans and all fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. Interest on all Base Rate Loans, shall
be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be. Each determination of an interest rate by
Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of
manifest error. Administrative Agent shall, at any time and from time to time
upon request of the Borrowers or any Lender, deliver to the Funds Administrator
or any Lender a statement showing the quotations used by Administrative Agent in
determining any interest rate applicable to Loans pursuant to this Agreement.

          3.4    COMPENSATION FOR FUNDING LOSSES. Borrowers shall compensate
each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth the basis
for requesting such amounts, showing the calculation thereof in reasonable
detail), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without
limitation, any interest paid by such Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it
to make or carry its Loans to the extent not recovered by the Lender in
connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds and including the
compensation payable by such Lender to a Person to which the Lender has
participated all or a portion of such Loan) and any loss sustained by such
Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds
(including, without limitation, a return on such liquidation or re-employment
that would result in such Lender receiving less than it would have received had
such Loan remained outstanding until the last day of the Interest Period
applicable to such Loans) which the Lender may sustain as a result of: (i) for
any reason (other than a default by such Lender or Administrative Agent) a
Borrowing of, continuation of, or conversion from or into, Eurocurrency Loans
does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice
of Conversion or Continuation (whether or not withdrawn); (ii) any payment,
prepayment or conversion or continuation of any of its Eurocurrency Loans
occurring for any reason whatsoever on a date which is not the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto; (iii) any repayment of any of its
Eurocurrency Loans not being made on the date specified in a notice of payment
given by the Funds Administrator; or (iv) (A) any other failure by the Borrowers
to

                                       57
<Page>

repay their Eurocurrency Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or
(B) an election made by Borrowers pursuant to SECTION 3.6. Each Lender shall
submit its written request as to additional amounts owed such Lender under this
SECTION 3.4 to the Funds Administrator and Administrative Agent within ten
Business Days of the event giving rise to such request, which request shall,
absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

          3.5    INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY, ETC.

          (a)    GENERALLY. Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 4.8, in the
event that any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but,
with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by Administrative Agent):

                 (i)    on any Interest Rate Determination Date that, by reason
     of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the
     interbank Eurocurrency market, adequate and fair means do not exist for
     ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
     definition of the Eurocurrency Rate applicable to such Loan for the
     applicable Interest Period, then, the obligation of the Lenders to make,
     convert, continue or maintain Eurocurrency Loans, as the case may be,
     hereunder shall be suspended until Administrative Agent revokes such notice
     thereof in writing;

                 (ii)   at any time that any Lender shall incur increased costs
     or reduction in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect
     to any Eurocurrency Loan because of any change since the date of this
     Agreement in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order,
     guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the
     interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of
     any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request,
     such as, for example, but not limited to (A) a change in the basis of
     taxation of payments to any Lender of the Principal of or interest on the
     Notes or any other amounts payable hereunder (except for (a) changes in the
     rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or profits of
     such Lender imposed by the jurisdiction in which its principal office or
     applicable lending office is located and (b) USA withholding taxes, which
     shall be governed by the provisions of Section 4.5) or (B) a change in
     official reserve requirements (but, in all events, excluding reserves
     required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of
     the Eurodollar Rate) and/or (y) other circumstances since the date of this
     Agreement affecting such Lender or the interbank Eurodollar market or the
     position of such Lender in such market (excluding, however, differences in
     a Lender's cost of funds from those of Administrative Agent which are
     solely the result of credit differences between such Lender and
     Administrative Agent); or

                 (iii)  at any time that the making or continuance of any
     Eurocurrency Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental
     rule, regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in
     good faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of
     law) or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the
     date of this Agreement which materially and adversely affects the interbank
     Eurocurrency market;

                                       58
<Page>

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or Administrative Agent in the case of
clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone, telefax or
telecopier confirmed in writing) to the Funds Administrator and, except in the
case of clause (i) above, to Administrative Agent of such determination (which
notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other
Lenders). Thereafter (A) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall
no longer be available until such time as Administrative Agent notifies the
Funds Administrator and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice by Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion or Continuation given by the Funds Administrator with
respect to Eurodollar Loans (other than with respect to conversions to Base Rate
Loans) which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall
be deemed rescinded by the Funds Administrator, (B) in the case of clause (ii)
above, Borrowers shall pay to such Lender, upon written demand therefor, such
additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method
of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion
shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such
increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a
written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing the
basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrowers by such Lender
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the
parties hereto; however the failure to give any such notice shall not release or
diminish Borrowers' obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this
SECTION 3.5(a); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the respective Lender has intentionally
withheld or delayed such notice, the respective Lender shall not be entitled to
receive additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(a) for periods occurring
prior to the 180th day before the giving of such written demand) and (C) in the
case of clause (iii) above, the Funds Administrator shall take one of the
actions specified in SECTION 3.5(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event,
within the time period required by law. In determining such additional amounts
pursuant to clause (B) of the immediately preceding sentence, each Lender shall
act reasonably and in good faith and will, to the extent the increased costs or
reductions in amounts receivable relate to such Lender's loans in general and
are not specifically attributable to a Loan hereunder, use averaging and
attribution methods which are reasonable and which cover all loans similar to
the Loans made by such Lender whether or not the loan documentation for such
other loans permits the Lender to receive increased costs of the type described
in this SECTION 3.5(a).

          (b)    EUROCURRENCY LOANS. At any time that any Eurocurrency Loan is
affected by the circumstances described in SECTION 3.5(a)(ii) OR (iii), the
Funds Administrator may (and in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan affected by the
circumstances described in SECTION 3.5(a)(iii) shall) either (i) if the affected
Loan is then being made initially or if the Loan is being converted or continued
pursuant to a Notice of Conversion or Continuation, by giving Administrative
Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the same date that the Funds
Administrator was notified by the affected Lender or Administrative Agent
pursuant to SECTION 3.5(a)(ii) OR (iii), cancel the respective Borrowing, or
(ii) if any affected Loan is a Eurodollar Loan then outstanding, upon at least
three Business Days' written notice to Administrative Agent, require the
affected Lender to convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, PROVIDED
that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders
must be treated the same pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(b).

                                       59
<Page>

          (c)    CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. If at any time after the date hereof, any
Lender determines that the introduction of or any change in any applicable law
or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not
having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's Loans or its
Revolving Commitment, if any, hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then
Borrowers shall pay to such Lender, upon its delivery of the written notice
hereafter referred to, therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to
compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such
Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such
Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital. In
determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good
faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and
which will, to the extent the increased costs or reduction in the rate of return
relates to such Lender's commitments or obligations in general and are not
specifically attributable to the Revolving Commitments, if any, and obligations
hereunder, cover all commitments and obligations similar to the Revolving
Commitments and obligations of such Lender hereunder whether or not the loan
documentation for such other commitments or obligations permits the Lender to
make the determination specified in this SECTION 3.5(c), and such Lender's
determination of compensation owing under this SECTION 3.5(c) shall, absent
manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.
Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable
pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the
Funds Administrator, which notice shall show the basis for calculation of such
additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not
release or diminish any of the Borrowers' obligations to pay additional amounts
pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the respective Lender has
intentionally withheld or delayed such notice, the respective Lender shall not
be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(c) for
periods occurring prior to the 180th day before the giving of such notice.

          (d)    EFFECT OF RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. In the event that any
Governmental Authority shall impose any Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements which
increase the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans,
then the Borrowers shall thereafter pay in respect of the Eurocurrency Loans
which are Revolving Loans of such Lender a rate of interest based upon the
Eurocurrency Reserve Rate (rather than upon the Eurocurrency Rate). From and
after the delivery by a Lender to the Funds Administrator of a notice indicating
that the cost to any Lender has increased as a result of such Eurocurrency
Reserve Requirement, all references contained in this Agreement to the
Eurocurrency Rate (other than that in the definition of Eurocurrency Reserve
Rate), shall be deemed to be references to the Eurocurrency Reserve Rate with
respect to each such affected Lender.

          3.6    REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

          If any Lender is owed increased costs under SECTION 3.5(a)(ii) or
(iii) or SECTION 3.5(c) or the Borrowers are required to make any payments under
SECTION 4.8(c) to any Lender materially in excess of those of the other Lenders,
the Borrowers shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default then
exists, to replace such Lender (the "REPLACED LENDER") with one

                                       60
<Page>

or more other Eligible Assignee or Assignees (collectively, the "REPLACEMENT
LENDER") acceptable to Administrative Agent; PROVIDED that (i) at the time of
any replacement pursuant to this SECTION 3.6, the Replaced Lender and
Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more assignment agreements, in form
and substance satisfactory to such parties and Administrative Agent, pursuant to
which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be,
of the outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and (ii) all obligations of the
Borrowers owing to the Replaced Lender relating to the Loans so replaced
(including, without limitation, such increased costs and excluding those
specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment
purchase price has been, or is concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to
such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of
the respective assignment documentation, the payment of amounts referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender,
delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
the Borrowers, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the
Replaced Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such
replaced Loans, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this
Agreement, which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender. The Replaced Lender
shall be required to deliver for cancellation its Notes to be cancelled on the
date of replacement, or if any such Note is lost or unavailable, such other
assurances or indemnification therefor as the Funds Administrator may reasonably
request.

          3.7    CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. Each Lender agrees that upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to increased costs or other special payments
under SECTIONS 3.5(a)(ii) and (iii), SECTION 3.5(c), SECTION 2.8(i) or SECTION
4.8(c) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Funds
Administrator, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations
of such Lender) to designate another Lending Office for any Loans or Letters of
Credit affected by such event, PROVIDED that such designation is made on such
terms that such Lender and its Lending Office suffer no economic, legal or
regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the
event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this SECTION 3.7
shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrowers or the rights
of any Lender provided in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

               REPAYMENTS; REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS; PAYMENTS AND

principal amount of the Revolving Loans on the Commitment Termination Date.

          4.2    VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. Upon at least one Business
Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice confirmed in writing) to
Administrative Agent at the Payment Office (which notice Administrative Agent
shall promptly transmit to each Revolving Lender), Borrowers shall have the
right, without premium or penalty, to terminate the unutilized portion of the
Revolving Commitments, in part or in whole; PROVIDED that (x) any such voluntary
termination of the Revolving Commitments shall apply to proportionately and
permanently

                                       61
<Page>

reduce the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender, (y) any partial
voluntary reduction pursuant to this SECTION 4.2 shall be in the amount of at
least $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount,
and (z) any such voluntary termination of the Revolving Commitments shall occur
simultaneously with a voluntary prepayment, if necessary, pursuant to SECTION
4.4 such that the total of the Revolving Commitments shall not be so reduced
below the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the
aggregate LC Obligations.

          4.3    MANDATORY REDUCTIONS OF COMMITMENTS.

          (a)    REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITMENT. The Revolving Commitments
shall be reduced at the times and in the amounts as required pursuant to SECTION
4.5(b) and SECTION 4.5(h).

          (b)    PROPORTIONATE REDUCTIONS. Each reduction or adjustment to the
Revolving Commitments pursuant to this SECTION 4.3 shall apply proportionately
to the Revolving Commitment of each Lender.

          4.4    VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrowers shall have the right to
prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part from time to time on the following
terms and conditions: (i) the Funds Administrator shall give an irrevocable
written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to
Administrative Agent, which such notice shall state Borrowers' intent to prepay
such Loans, the amount of such prepayment and the Loans to which such prepayment
is to be applied, which notice shall be given by the Funds Administrator to
Administrative Agent by 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least three Business
Days prior to the date of such prepayment if a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans or

partial prepayment of any Borrowing (other than daily prepayments from the
Master Collection Account) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least
$1,000,000; (iii) Eurocurrency Loans may only be prepaid pursuant to this
SECTION 4.4 on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or on any
other day subject to SECTION 3.4; and (iv) a partial prepayment of Eurocurrency
Loans shall not be made that would result in the remaining aggregate outstanding
principal amount thereof being less than the minimum principal amount that would
be required in respect of a Borrowing of similar Eurocurrency Loans. Each
prepayment in respect of any Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among the Loans
comprising such Borrowing. The notice provisions, the provisions with respect to
the minimum amount of any prepayment and the provisions requiring prepayments in
integral multiples above such minimum amount are for the benefit of
Administrative Agent and may be waived unilaterally by Administrative Agent.

          4.5    MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

          (a)    PREPAYMENT OF REVOLVING LOANS UPON OVERADVANCE. The Borrowers
shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans on any date
on which the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Loans together with
the LC Obligations (after

                                       62
<Page>

giving effect to any other repayments or prepayments on such day) exceeds the
aggregate Revolving Commitments.

          (b)    MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL. Simultaneously
with any Change of Control, the Revolving Commitments shall be reduced to zero
and the Borrowers shall prepay, in full, the outstanding principal amount of any
outstanding Revolving Loans (and cash collateralize any outstanding LC
Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the LC Obligations), together with all
accrued interest, fees, and other expenses incurred by Administrative Agent, the
Facing Bank or the Lenders as a result of such Change in Control and prepayment.

          (c)    MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON EXCEEDING BORROWING BASE. At any time

Day (x) repay the Revolving Loans in an amount equal to such excess, and (y)
thereafter, to the extent of any remaining excess, provide cash collateral in an
amount equal to 105% of the LC Obligations to cash collateralize LC Obligations.
Any cash required to cash collateralize Obligations pursuant to this SECTION
4.5(c) (the "BORROWING BASE CASH COLLATERAL AMOUNT") shall be deposited or

subject to release or application to the Obligations as provided herein or in
the Security Documents.

          (d)    MANDATORY PREPAYMENT OF REVOLVING LOANS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at 5:00
P.M. (New York City time) on any Business Day on which Revolving Loans are
outstanding and funds are on deposit in the Master Collection Account,
Collateral Agent shall transfer from the Master Collection Account an amount
equal to the Master Collection Account Balance FIRST, to prepay outstanding
Revolving Loans and SECOND to cash collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit
in an amount equal to 105% of the LC Obligations, and THIRD, at Funds

to Administrative Agent a Borrowing Base certificate prepared on a pro forma
basis (a "PRO FORMA BORROWING BASE CERTIFICATE") giving effect to such Asset
Disposition and setting forth the value of the Inventory and Receivables
previously included in the Borrowing Base and disposed of in such Asset
Disposition. On such Business Day, Borrowers shall prepay the Loans in an amount
equal to the change in the Borrowing Base as reflected in such Pro Forma
Borrowing Base Certificate.

          (f)    DAILY MANDATORY PREPAYMENT OF REVOLVING LOANS. On any Business
Day on which Revolving Loans are outstanding and funds are on deposit in the
Master Collection Account, Collateral Agent shall transfer from the Master
Collection Account an amount equal to the Master Collection Account Balance to
prepay outstanding Revolving Loans. If funds remain in the Master Collection
Account after giving effect to the provisions of the preceding sentence, such
remaining balance shall be retained in the Master Collection Account; PROVIDED,
that,

                                       63
<Page>

equal to the change in the Borrowing Base as reflected in such Pro Forma
Borrowing Base Certificate.

          (h)    MANDATORY PREPAYMENT ON DECEMBER 30, 2005. If, as of the close
of business on December 29, 2005, the outstanding principal amount of Term B
Loans (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) shall exceed
$100 million, Borrowers shall on the following Business Day prepay, in full, the
outstanding principal amount of any outstanding Revolving Loans (and cash
collateralize any outstanding LC Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the
LC Obligations), together with all accrued interest, fees and other expenses due
and owing to Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Revolving Commitments
shall be reduced to zero. The Company shall keep Administrative Agent informed
of its plans with respect to the prepayment of the Term B Loans as contemplated
by this SECTION 4.5(h).

          4.6    PAYMENTS.

          (a)    MASTER COLLECTION ACCOUNT. To the extent, pursuant to this
Agreement and after giving effect to the prepayments required by SECTION 4.5(c),
the aggregate Revolving Commitments would be reduced below the amount of LC
Obligations or the Borrowing Base is less than the LC Obligations, Borrowers
shall cash collateralize such LC Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the
aggregate stated amount of LC Obligations by depositing and/or maintaining the
Borrowing Base Cash Collateral Amount with Administrative Agent in the Master
Collection Account. In the event that cash collateral is held in the Master
Collection Account pursuant to SECTION 4.5(c), and thereafter an Event of
Default occurs, such cash shall immediately be applied in the manner specified
in SECTION 4.5(d).

          FIFTH, to the ratable payment of principal due on the Base Rate Loans;

          the aggregate stated amount of LC Obligations as required by the terms
          of this Agreement) and with respect to Eurodollar Loans in such order
          as the Funds Administrator shall request (and in the absence of such
          request, as Administrative Agent shall determine);

          SEVENTH, to the ratable payment of other Obligations not specifically
          referred to in this SECTION 4.6(b) due and payable to the Lenders (in

          under the Loan Documents; and

          EIGHTH, to the ratable payment of other Obligations not specifically
          referred to in this SECTION 4.6(b) due and payable to any Facing Banks
          under any Letters of Credit.

If any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall
reduce the outstanding Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less
than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), such Borrowing shall immediately be
converted into Base Rate Loans. All prepayments shall include payment of accrued
interest on the principal amount so prepaid, shall be applied to the payment of
interest before application to principal and shall be subject to the
requirements of SECTION 3.4.

          4.7    METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT BY BORROWERS.

          (a)    Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments
(including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers on account of principal,
interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall be made without
set-off or counterclaim and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, be made to Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the
applicable Lenders in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than
2:00 P.M. (New York city time) on the date specified herein. Any such payment
shall be made to such account of Administrative Agent as Administrative Agent
shall specify by notice to the Funds Administrator, provided that unless and
until otherwise specified, all such payments payable in Dollars shall be made to
Administrative Agent at its office at 233 South Wacker Drive, Suite 8400,
Chicago, Illinois 60606. Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each
Lender its applicable Revolving Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as
expressly provided herein), as the case may be, of such principal, interest,
fees or other amounts, in like funds as received. Any payment which is received
by Administrative Agent later than 2:00 P.M. (local time in the place

                                       65
<Page>

of payment) shall be deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding
Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue until
such payment is deemed to have been received.

          (b)    Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a
day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of interest or fees, as the case may be, subject to the provisions
set forth in the definition of "Interest Period" herein.

          (c)    Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Funds Administrator prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
hereunder that Borrowers will not make such payment in full, Administrative
Agent may assume that Borrowers have made such payment in full to Administrative
Agent as required hereunder on such date and Administrative Agent may (but shall
not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed
to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such
Lender. If and to the extent Borrowers shall not have made such payment in full
to Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to Administrative Agent on
demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon
for each day from the date such amount was distributed to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to Administrative Agent, at the Federal
Funds Rate as in effect for each such day.

          4.8    NET PAYMENTS.

          (a)    All payments made by the Borrowers hereunder or under any Loan
Document will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as
provided in SECTION 4.8(d), all payments hereunder and under any of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, payments on account of principal and
interest and fees) shall be made by the Borrowers free and clear of and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, duty,
levy, impost, assessment or other charge of whatever nature now or hereafter
imposed by any Governmental Authority, but excluding therefrom:

                 (i)    a tax imposed on or measured by the overall net income
     (including a franchise tax based on net income) of the Lender or its
     lending offices by the USA or jurisdictions or political subdivision or
     taxing authority thereof in which such Lender's principal office or lending
     offices are located or are resident or in which such Lender is
     incorporated;

                 (ii)   in the case of any Lender organized under the laws of
     any jurisdiction other than the USA or any state thereof (including the
     District of Columbia), any taxes imposed by the USA by means of withholding
     at the source unless such withholding results from a change in applicable
     law, treaty or regulations or the interpretation or administration thereof
     (including, without limitation, any guideline or policy not having the
     force of law) by any authority charged with the administration thereof
     subsequent to the date such Lender becomes a Lender with respect to the
     Loan or portion thereof affected by such change;

                                       66
<Page>

                 (iii)  any taxes to which the Lender (to the extent of the tax
     rate then in effect) would be subject to (as of the Closing Date) if a
     payment hereunder had been received by the Lender and, with respect to any
     Lender that becomes a party hereto after the date hereof, any taxes to
     which such Lender (to the extent of the tax rate then in effect) would be
     subject as of the date it becomes a party hereto if a payment had been
     received by the Lender (other than taxes which each other Lender is
     entitled to reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement)

                 (iv)   taxes to which the Lender becomes subject subsequent to
     the date referred to in clause (iii) above as a result of a change in the
     residence, place of incorporation, or principal place of business of the
     Lender, a change in the branch or lending office of the Lender
     participating in the transactions set forth herein or other similar
     circumstances unless such change or similar circumstance shall have been
     made at the request of the Funds Administrator, and

                 (v)    taxes as a result of the recognition by the Lender of
     gain on the sale, assignment or participation by the Lender of the
     participating interests in its creditor positions hereunder (such tax or
     taxes, other than excluded tax or taxes, being herein referred to as "TAX"
     or "TAXES"). If any Borrower is required by law to make any deduction or
     withholding of any Taxes from any payment due hereunder or under any of the
     Loan Documents, then the amount payable will be increased to such amount
     which, after deduction from such increased amount of all such Taxes
     required to be withheld or deducted therefrom, will not be less than the
     amount due and payable hereunder had no such deduction or withholding been
     required. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable to a Lender
     under this SECTION 4.8 submitted to the Funds Administrator by such Lender
     shall show in reasonable detail the amount payable and the calculations
     used to determine in good faith such amount and shall, absent manifest
     error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto.

          (b)    If any Borrower makes any payment hereunder or under any of the
Loan Documents in respect of which it is required by law to make any deduction
or withholding of any Taxes, it shall pay the full amount to be deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxation or other authority within the time allowed for
such payment under applicable law and shall deliver to the Lenders within 30
days after it has made such payment to the applicable authority a receipt issued
by such authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so
required to be deducted or withheld from such payment.

          (c)    Without prejudice to the other provisions of this SECTION 4.8,
if any Lender, or Administrative Agent on its behalf, is required by law to make
any payment on account of Taxes on or in relation to any amount received or
receivable hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents by such Lender, or
Administrative Agent on its behalf, or any liability for Tax in respect of any
such payment is imposed, levied or assessed against any Lender or Administrative
Agent on its behalf, Borrowers will promptly, following receipt of the
certificate described in the immediately following sentence, indemnify such
person against such Tax payment or liability, together with any interest,
penalties and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) payable
or incurred in connection therewith, including any tax of any

                                       67
<Page>

Lender arising by virtue of payments under this SECTION 4.8(c), computed in a
manner consistent with this SECTION 4.8(c). A certificate prepared in good faith
as to the amount of such payment by such Lender, or Administrative Agent on its
behalf, showing calculations thereof in reasonable detail, absent manifest
error, shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto for all
purposes.

          (d)    Each Lender that is not a USA person (as such term is defined
in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to the Funds Administrator
and Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in the case of a
Lender that is an Assignee of an interest under this Agreement (unless the
respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such
assignment), on the date of such assignment to such Lender, (i) two accurate and
complete original signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY (or
successor or other applicable forms prescribed by the IRS) certifying to such
Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from or reduced rate of USA
withholding tax on interest payments to be made under this Agreement and under
any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver the applicable form pursuant to
clause (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 4.8(d)
(any such certificate, a "SECTION 4.8(d)(ii) CERTIFICATE") and (y) two accurate
and complete original signed copies of IRS Form W-8 BEN or W-8ECI (or successor
form) certifying to such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from USA
withholding tax on payments of interest to be made under this Agreement and
under any Note; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be required to deliver a
an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8IMY, or Section 4.8(d)(ii) Certificate under this
SECTION 4.8(d) to the extent that the delivery of such form is not authorized by
law; PROVIDED FURTHER, however, that in the event that a Lender provides the
Funds Administrator or the Administrative Agent with an IRS Form W-8IMY (or
substitute form) indicating that it is a "flow through" entity, as defined in
Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1441 of the Code, or otherwise,
not a beneficial owner of interest payments under this Agreement and under any
Note, such Lender agrees, on or prior to the Closing Date, or the date of
assignment to such Lender, as applicable, to take any actions necessary, and to
deliver to the Funds Administrator and Administrative Agent all forms necessary,
to establish such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from, or a
reduction in, USA withholding tax on payments of interest to be made under this
Agreement and under any Note, including causing its partners, members,
beneficiaries, beneficial owners, and their beneficial owners, if any, to take
any actions and deliver any forms necessary to establish such exemption.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a fiscally transparent entity may provide an
IRS Form W-8BEN to claim a treaty exemption or rate reduction to the extent that
such entity is receiving interest and is not treated as fiscally transparent by
its own jurisdiction, provided the satisfaction of such conditions entitles the
Lender to an exemption or reduction from withholding at the time such Lender
becomes a party to this Agreement and (ii) a withholding foreign partnership,
withholding foreign trust, and qualified intermediary shall only provide such
information as is required by Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code
Section 1441. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Forms" shall include any
attachments for to IRS Forms W-8IMY required to be filed by the Lender. In
addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date, when
a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification
obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Lender will deliver to the
Funds Administrator and Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete
original signed copies of an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI,

                                       68
<Page>

or W-8IMY and a Section 4.8(d)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such
other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement
of such Lender (or its partners, members, beneficiaries, or beneficial owners)
to a continued exemption from or reduction in USA withholding Tax on interest
payments under this Agreement and any Note, or it shall immediately notify the
Funds Administrator and Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any
such form or certificate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be required to
deliver an IRS Form W8-BEN, W-8ECI, or W-8IMY under this SECTION 4.8(d) to the
extent that the delivery of such form is not authorized by law; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that any Lender which does not deliver the applicable form
pursuant to SECTION 4.8(d) shall be entitled to additional payment pursuant to
SECTION 4.8(a) or indemnification under SECTION 4.8(c) only if and to the extent
(i) such failure results solely from a change in law or (ii) the Tax to which
such additional payment or indemnification relates would have been imposed
regardless of whether such Lender provided such forms. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in SECTION 4.8, any Lender that has not provided to
the Funds Administrator the IRS Forms required to be provided to the Funds
Administrator pursuant to this SECTION 4.8(d) shall not be entitled to any
payment of additional amounts pursuant to SECTION 4.8(a) or indemnification
under SECTION 4.8(c) with respect to any deduction or withholding which would
not have been required if such Lender had provided such forms.

          (e)    Each Lender that is incorporated or organized under the laws of
the USA or a state thereof shall provide two properly completed and duly
executed copies of IRS Form W-9, or any successor or other applicable form. Each
Lender shall deliver to the Funds Administrator and Administrative Agent
(provided that such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), two further duly
executed forms and statements, properly completed in all material respects, at
or before the time any such form or statement expires or becomes obsolete, or
otherwise as reasonably requested by the Funds Administrator. Each Lender shall
promptly notify the Funds Administrator at any time it determines that it is no
longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the
Funds Administrator (or any other form or certification adopted by U.S. taxing
authorities for such purpose).

          (f)    Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after it
becomes aware of the occurrence of any event or the existence of any condition
that would cause any Borrower to make a payment in respect of any Taxes to such
Lender pursuant to SECTION 4.8(a) or a payment in indemnification for any Taxes
pursuant to SECTION 4.8(c), it will use reasonable efforts to make, fund or
maintain the Loan (or portion thereof) of such Lender with respect to which the
aforementioned payment is or would be made through another lending office of
such Lender or take any other action reasonably requested by such Borrower if as
a result thereof the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be
paid by such Borrower in respect of such Loans (or portions thereof) or
participation in Letters of Credit pursuant to SECTION 4.8(a) or SECTION 4.8(c)
would be materially reduced, and if, as determined by such Lender, in its
reasonable discretion, the making, funding or maintaining of such Loans or
participation in Letters of Credit (or portions thereof) through such other
lending office or taking of such other action would not otherwise materially
adversely affect such Loans or such Lender. The Borrowers agree to pay all
reasonable expenses incurred by any Lender in utilizing another lending office
of such Lender or taking of such other action pursuant to this SECTION 4.8(f).

          4.9    PAYMENTS BY THE LENDERS TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

          (a)    Except as provided in SECTION 4.9(b), Administrative Agent
shall give to each Lender prompt notice of each Notice of Borrowing by telecopy
or facsimile transmission. No later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the
date of receipt of each Notice of Borrowing (unless such Notice of Borrowing
specifies the Closing Date as the date of Borrowing, in which case no later than
11:00 A.M. on the Closing Date), each Lender will make available for the account
of its Lending Office, to Administrative Agent at the address of Administrative
Agent, in immediately available funds, its Revolving Pro Rata Share of such
Borrowing requested to be made. Unless Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not
intend to make available to Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing to
be made on such date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender will make
such amount available to Administrative Agent on the Settlement Date and
Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may but shall not be
obligated to make available the amount of the Borrowing to be provided by such
Lender. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made available to
Administrative Agent its Revolving Pro Rata Share on such date and
Administrative Agent shall have so made available to the Borrowers a
corresponding amount on behalf of such Lender, Administrative Agent may recover
such amount on demand from such Lender in accordance with SECTION 13.5. If such
Lender does not pay such corresponding amount promptly upon Administrative
Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent may promptly notify the Funds
Administrator and the Borrowers shall immediately repay such corresponding
amount to Administrative Agent together with accrued interest thereon at the
applicable rate or rates provided in SECTION 3.1 without making or being
responsible for any payment under SECTION 3.4.

          (b)    SETTLEMENT OF ADVANCES. Unless the Required Lenders have
instructed Administrative Agent to the contrary, Administrative Agent on behalf
of Lenders may, but shall not be obligated to, make Base Rate Loans under
SECTION 2.2 without prior notice of the proposed Borrowing to the Lenders. Loans
made pursuant to this SECTION 4.9(b) shall be subject to the following
settlement arrangements:

                 (i)    The amount of each Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of
     such Loans shall be computed weekly (or more frequently in Administrative
     Agent's discretion) and shall be adjusted upward or downward on the basis
     of the amount of outstanding Loans as of 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on
     the last Business Day of the period specified by Administrative Agent (such
     date, the "SETTLEMENT DATE"). Administrative Agent shall deliver to each of
     the Lenders promptly after the Settlement Date a summary statement of the
     amount of such outstanding Loans for such period. The Lenders shall
     transfer to Administrative Agent such amounts as are necessary so that
     (after giving effect to all such transfers) the amount of Loans made by
     each Lender shall be equal to such Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of the
     aggregate amount of Loans outstanding as of such Settlement Date. During an
     Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default relating to a Bankruptcy
     Event, amounts required to be transferred by the Lenders to Administrative
     Agent shall, instead of constituting Loans to the Borrowers, be in the form
     of participations purchased by the Lenders in the outstanding Loans of DB,
     acting as Administrative Agent. If the summary statement is received by the
     Lenders

                                       70
<Page>

     prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on any Business Day, each Lender
     shall make the transfers described above in immediately available funds no
     later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day such summary statement
     was received; and if such summary statement is received by the Lenders
     after 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on such day, each Lender shall make
     such transfers no later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the next
     succeeding Business Day. The obligation of each of the Lenders to transfer
     such funds shall be irrevocable and unconditional and without recourse to
     or warranty by Administrative Agent. Each of Administrative Agent and the
     Lenders agrees to mark its books and records on the Settlement Date to show
     at all times the dollar amount of its Revolving Pro Rata Share of the
     outstanding Loans.

                 (ii)   To the extent that the settlement described above shall
     not yet have occurred, upon repayment of Loans by the Borrowers,
     Administrative Agent may first apply such amounts repaid directly to the
     amounts made available by Administrative Agent pursuant to this SECTION
     4.9(b).

                 (iii)  Because Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders
     may be advancing and/or may be repaid Loans prior to the time when the
     Lenders will actually advance and/or be repaid Loans, interest with respect
     to Loans shall be allocated by Administrative Agent to each Lender and
     Administrative Agent in accordance with the amount of Loans actually
     advanced by and repaid to each Lender and Administrative Agent and shall
     accrue from and including the date such Loans are so advanced to but
     excluding the date such Loans are either repaid by the Borrowers in
     accordance with SECTION 4.5 or actually settled by the applicable Lender as
     described in this SECTION 4.9(b).

          (c)    The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date of
Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make
a Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make the Loan or such advance to be made by such
other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

          4.10   SHARING OF PAYMENTS; ETC.

          (a)    If, other than as expressly set forth elsewhere herein, any
Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether
voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoffs, or
otherwise) in excess of its applicable Revolving Pro Rata Share (or other pro
rata share as expressly provided herein) of payments on account of Loans made or
participated in by all the Lenders under any Facility, such Lender shall
forthwith (x) notify Administrative Agent of such fact, and (y) purchase from
the other Lenders in such Facility, such participations in the Loans, made by
them and then due, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to that
extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender
the purchase price paid therefor together with an amount equal to such paying
Lender's applicable Pro Rata Share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so

                                       71
<Page>

recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.
Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in
the absence of manifest error), of participations purchased pursuant to this
SECTION 4.10(a) and will in each case promptly notify the Lenders and Borrower
following any such purchases. Any payments received after the Lenders have taken
action pursuant to this SECTION 4.10(a) shall be allocated ratably among the
Revolving Loans. Any payments received after the Lenders have taken action
pursuant to this SECTION 4.10(a) shall be allocated ratably among the Loans.

          (b)    Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this SECTION 4.10 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of setoffs, but subject to SECTION 13.6) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          (c)    Nothing herein shall require any Lender to exercise any right
of setoffs or similar rights or shall affect the right of any Lender to
exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to
any other indebtedness or obligation of any Borrower.

          4.11   MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNT. Administrative Agent shall maintain a
separate account on its books and records in the name of Borrowers ("BORROWERS'
ACCOUNT") in which the Borrowers will be charged or credited with (w) the
proceeds, if any, of each Loan received by or for the account of Borrowers, (x)
payments made to Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations of
Borrowers, whether from collection of proceeds of Collateral or otherwise, (y)
the aggregate face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued for the
benefit of Borrowers, and (z) all other fees, expenses and other Obligations
attributable to Borrowers as determined by Administrative Agent. In no event
shall prior recourse to any Inventory, Receivables or other Collateral be a
prerequisite to Administrative Agent's right to demand payment of any Obligation
upon its maturity.

          4.12   STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT. After the end of each month,
Administrative Agent shall send the Funds Administrator a statement accounting
for the charges, loans, advances and other transactions occurring among and
between Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrowers during that month.
The monthly statements shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and
binding on the Borrowers; PROVIDED that any failure to so record any transaction
or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect any Borrower's
duty to pay the Obligations.

                                    ARTICLE V

                              CONDITIONS OF CREDIT

          5.1    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AGREEMENT. The
obligation of the Lenders to make the Revolving Loans and the obligation of the
Facing Bank to issue and the Lenders to participate in Letters of Credit under
this Agreement shall be subject to

                                       72
<Page>

the fulfillment, at or prior to the time of the making of such Loans, of each of
the following conditions:

     amended from time to time, the "SECURITY AGREEMENT") and shall have
     delivered to the Collateral Agent, all the Pledged Securities and Pledged
     Intercompany Notes referred to therein then owned, if any, by any Credit

(i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation, partnership, limited

corporate or other appropriate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform the terms and provisions of each of the Loan Documents to which it is
party and has taken all necessary corporate or other appropriate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each of such Loan
Documents. Each Credit Party has duly executed and delivered each of the Loan
Documents to which it is party, and each of such Loan Documents constitutes its
legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable principles (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).

          6.3    NO VIOLATION. The execution, delivery or performance by any
Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party (including, without
limitation, the granting of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents), nor
compliance by it with the terms and provisions thereof, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated therein (i) will contravene any provision

                                       81
<Page>

of any Requirement of Law applicable to any Credit Party, (ii) will conflict
with or result in any breach of or constitute a tortious interference with any
of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create
or impose) any Lien (except pursuant to the Security Documents) upon any of the
property or assets of any Credit Party pursuant to the terms of, any Contractual
Obligation to which any Credit Party is a party or by which it or any of its
property or assets is bound or to which it may be subject, (iii) will violate
any provision of any Organizational Document of any Credit Party or (iv)
requires any approval of stockholders or any approval or consent of any Person
(other than a Governmental Authority) except as have been obtained or as set
forth on SCHEDULE 6.3.

          6.4    GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER APPROVALS. Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 6.4 hereto and except for the recording of the Mortgages and the filing
of UCC financing statements, which shall be recorded and filed, respectively,
on, or as soon as practicable after, the date hereof, no order, consent,
approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with or exemption by, any Governmental Authority (except as have
been obtained or made on or prior to the Closing Date), is required to
authorize, or is required in connection with, the execution, delivery and
performance of any Loan Document.

copies of which have been furnished to Administrative Agent prior to the date

presents fairly the financial condition of the applicable Credit Party as of the
date thereof. The Historical Financial Statements identified on SCHEDULE 6.5(a)
as audited financial statements have been examined by Deloitte & Touche,
independent certified public accountants, who delivered an opinion in respect
thereto, and present fairly the financial condition of the applicable Credit
Party at the date of each respective audited balance sheet. Since December 31,
2001, there has been no Material Adverse Effect.

          (b)    SOLVENCY. On and as of the Closing Date, after giving effect to
the Transactions and to all Indebtedness (including the Loans) being incurred,
and to be incurred (and the use of proceeds thereof), and Liens created, and to
be created, by Borrowers in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of each Borrower and
each other Material Subsidiary will exceed its debts; (ii) no Borrower and no
Material Subsidiary has incurred or intends to, or believes that it will, incur
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature; and (iii) each
Borrower and each other Material Subsidiary will have sufficient capital with
which to conduct its business. For purposes of this SECTION 6.5(b) "debt" means
any liability on a claim, and "claim" means (y) any right to payment, whether or
not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured,
or unsecured (including all obligations, if any, under any Plan or the
equivalent for unfunded past service liability, and any other unfunded medical
and death benefits) or (z) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or

                                       82
<Page>

not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured. In computing the
amount of contingent or unliquidated liabilities at any time, such liabilities
will be computed at the amount which, in light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably
be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

          (c)    NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as fully reflected in the
financial statements and the notes related thereto delivered pursuant to SECTION
6.5(a) and on SCHEDULE 6.5(d) there were, to the best of Borrowers' knowledge,
as of the Closing Date (and after giving effect to the Transactions occurring on
such date) no liabilities or obligations with respect to any Borrower or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in
aggregate, would be material to Borrowers.

          (d)    INDEBTEDNESS. SCHEDULE 6.5(d) sets forth a true and complete
list of (i) all Indebtedness of each Borrower, each of their Restricted
Subsidiaries, HSCHC and HSCC (other than Loans, Intercompany Indebtedness or
Loans hereunder) that is outstanding as of the Closing Date and that remains
outstanding after giving effect to the Transactions, to the extent that, in each
case, such Indebtedness is in excess of $1,000,000 (the "EXISTING OBLIGATIONS"),
in aggregate principal amount thereof as of a date not more than three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn
commitments with respect thereto as of the date specified therein), and (ii)
Interest Rate Agreements, the notional amount thereof and the name of the
respective obligor and any other entity which directly or indirectly guaranteed
such debt. No Existing Obligation has been incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Borrowers have delivered or caused to be delivered to Administrative
Agent a true and complete copy of the form of each instrument evidencing
Indebtedness for money borrowed listed on SCHEDULE 6.5(d) and of each instrument
pursuant to which such Indebtedness for money borrowed was issued.

          (e)    PRO FORMA. The PRO FORMA balance sheet of the Borrowers
attached hereto as SCHEDULE 6.5(e) (the "PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET") presents
fairly the financial condition of the Borrowers at the date of such balance
sheet and presents a good faith estimate of the PRO FORMA financial condition of
the Borrowers (after giving effect to the Transactions, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby) at the date thereof). The Pro
Forma Balance Sheet has been prepared using financial statements of the
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries which were prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) subject
to normal year-end adjustments.

          (f)    PROJECTIONS. On and as of the Closing Date, the financial
projections, attached hereto as SCHEDULE 6.5(f) and previously delivered to
Administrative Agent and the Lenders (the "PROJECTIONS") and each of the
Projections delivered after the Closing Date pursuant to SECTION 7.2(f) are, at
the time made, based on good faith estimates and assumptions made by the
management of Borrowers, and there are no statements or conclusions in any of
the Projections which, at the time made, are based upon or include information
known to Borrowers to be misleading or which fail to take into account material
information regarding the matters reported therein. On the Closing Date,
Borrowers believe that the Projections are reasonable and

                                       83
<Page>

attainable, it being understood that uncertainty is inherent in any forecasts or
projections and that no assurance can be given that the results set forth in the
Projections will actually be obtained.

          6.6    LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending
or, to the best knowledge of Borrowers, threatened (except for litigation that
would be rendered moot by, or would not survive, the consummation of the Plan of
Reorganization) against Borrowers or any of its Subsidiaries (i) with respect to
any Loan Document seeking to enjoin any Borrower's or any Subsidiary's
performance thereof or (ii) which would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          6.7    TRUE AND COMPLETE DISCLOSURE. All factual information (taken as
a whole) heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of Borrowers
or any of their Subsidiaries in writing (including electronically) to any Lender
(other than the Projections as to which SECTION 6.5(e) applies) for purposes of
or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein is,
and all other such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by
or on behalf of Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries in writing to any Lender
for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated herein will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the
date as of which such information is dated or certified and not incomplete by
omitting to state any fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole)
not misleading in any material respect at such time in light of the
circumstances under which such information was provided. The Lenders acknowledge
that they have not relied on Borrowers' company brochures.

          6.8    MARGIN REGULATIONS. No part of the proceeds of any Loan has
been or will be used to purchase or carry any margin stock (as defined in
Regulation U of the Board), directly or indirectly, or to extend credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any such margin stock for the purpose of
reducing or retiring any indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase
or carry any margin security or for any other purpose which might cause any of
the loans or extensions of credit under this Agreement to be considered a
"purpose credit" within the meaning of Regulation T, U or X of the Board.

          6.9    TAX RETURNS AND PAYMENTS. The Borrowers and their Subsidiaries
have filed or caused to be filed all tax returns which are required to be filed,
except where failure to file any such returns would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes
shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against
them or any of their respective material properties and all other material
taxes, fees or other charges imposed on them or any of their respective
properties by any Governmental Authority (other than those the amount or
validity of which is contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the
books of Borrowers or their Subsidiaries, as the case may be) except where
failure to take any such action would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; and no tax liens have been filed and no claims are
being asserted with respect to any such taxes, fees or other charges (other than
such liens or claims, the amount or validity of which is currently being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which
reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided) which would be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.10   COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA. Each Plan has been operated and
administered in a manner so as not to result in any material liability of any
Borrower for failure to comply with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the
Code; no Reportable Event which could reasonably be expected to result in the
termination of any Plan has occurred with respect to a Plan; to the best
knowledge of each Borrower, no Multiemployer Plan is insolvent or in
reorganization; no Plan has an accumulated or waived funding deficiency or has
applied for an extension of any amortization period within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code; the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliates have not incurred any material liability to or on account of a Plan
pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4069, 4201 or
4204 of ERISA or Section 4971 or 4975 of the Code; no proceedings have been
instituted to terminate any Plan within the last fiscal year; using actuarial
assumptions and computation methods consistent with subpart 1 of subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA, to the best knowledge of Borrowers, the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates would not have any material liability to any
Plans which are Multiemployer Plans in the event of a complete withdrawal
therefrom, as of the close of the most recent fiscal year of each such
Multiemployer Plan ending prior to the Closing Date; no Lien imposed under the
Code or ERISA on the assets of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate exists or is likely to arise on account of any Plan; and the
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries do not maintain or contribute to any employee
welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which provides
benefits to retired employees (other than as required by Section 601 of ERISA)
or any employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) the
obligations with respect to either of which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.11   OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY. The Borrowers and their Restricted
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title in fee simple to, a valid leasehold
interest in, or a valid contractual agreement to use, all its material real
property, and good title to, a valid leasehold interest in, or valid contractual
rights to use all its other material property, and none of such property is
subject to any Lien except for Permitted Liens. As of the Closing Date, the
Borrowers and their Restricted Subsidiaries have granted mortgages to secure the

(contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any
character relating to any of its Capital Stock or any stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock (other than as set
forth in the certificate of incorporation of such Borrower). Neither the Company
nor any of its

                                       85

          (c)    RESTRICTIONS ON OR RELATING TO SUBSIDIARIES. There does not
exist any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of (i) any
Restricted Subsidiary of a Borrower to pay dividends or make any other

Material Adverse Effect; (iv) there is not now, nor to the knowledge of any

<Page>

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, nor are there any facts or
circumstances currently known to a Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that may
reasonably be expected to give rise to such an Environmental Lien.

          6.18   LABOR RELATIONS. No Borrower and no Restricted Subsidiary of a
Borrower is engaged in any unfair labor practice that could reasonably be

          6.21   SECURITY DOCUMENTS.

          (a)    SECURITY AGREEMENT COLLATERAL. The provisions of the Security
Documents are effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant to the Security Agreement, a legal,
valid and enforceable security interest in all right,

                                       88
<Page>

title and interest of the applicable Credit Party in the Collateral owned by
such Credit Party, and the Security Agreement, together with the filings of Form
UCC-1 in all relevant jurisdictions creates a first lien on, and security
interest in, all right, title and interest of Borrowers and such Credit Parties
in all of the Collateral described therein, subject to no other Liens other than
Permitted Liens. Except for titled vehicles, vessels and other collateral which
may not be perfected through the filing of financing statements under the
Uniform Commercial Code of the appropriate jurisdiction and which have an
aggregate fair market value of less than $5,000,000, all such liens have been
or, upon the filing of the financing statements delivered on the Closing Date,
will be fully perfected liens except for Permitted Liens. The recordation in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office and in the United States Copyright
Office of assignments for security made pursuant to the Security Agreement will
be effective, under Federal law, to perfect the security interest granted to the
Collateral Agent in the trademarks, patents and copyrights covered by the
Security Agreement. The recordation with the United States Surface
Transportation Board of assignments for security made pursuant to the Security
Agreement will be effective under Federal law, to create a valid first lien in
favor of the Collateral Agent in the railcars covered by the Security Agreement.
Each Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary has good and marketable title to
all Collateral, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens.

          (b)    PLEDGED SECURITIES. The security interests created in favor of
the Collateral Agent, as pledgee for the benefit of the Lenders under the
Security Agreement, constitute perfected security interests in the Pledged
Securities and Pledged Intercompany Notes, subject to no security interests of
any other Person other than Permitted Liens. Except as set forth in the Security
Agreement, no filings, registrations or recordings which have not been made or
will not have been made (or submitted for recordation) within 10 Business Days
after the Closing Date are required in order to perfect the security interests
created in the Pledged Securities or Pledged Intercompany Notes under the
Security Agreement. Sixty-five percent (65%) of the Capital Stock of all direct
Foreign Subsidiaries with a net book value and a fair market value in excess of
$250,000 are pledged to the Collateral Agent.

          (c)    REAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL. The Mortgages create, as security for
the obligations purported to be secured thereby, a valid and enforceable
perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Mortgaged Property
(including, without limitation, all fixtures and improvements relating to such
Mortgaged Property and affixed or added thereto on or after the Closing Date) in
favor of the Collateral Agent (or such other trustee as may be named therein)
for the benefit of the Secured Parties under the Security Agreement, superior to
and prior to the rights of all third Persons (except that the security interest
created in the Mortgaged Property may be subject to the Permitted Liens related
thereto) and subject to no other Liens (other than Liens permitted under SECTION
8.1). SCHEDULE 6.21(c) contains a true and complete list as of the Closing Date
of (x) each parcel of real property of each Borrower and each Restricted
Subsidiary with an estimated fair market value in excess of $1,000,000, (y) the
type of interest in such parcel of real property held by such Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiaries and (z) whether or not such parcel of real property is
Mortgaged Property. Each Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary has good and
marketable title to all Mortgaged Property free and clear of all Liens except
those described in the first sentence of this SECTION 6.21(c).

                                       89
<Page>

          (d)    ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES AND ELIGIBLE INVENTORY. Each Receivable
included in the Net Receivables Balance is, to the best of each Credit Party's
knowledge, an Eligible Receivable, and all Inventory included in the calculation
of the Borrowing Base constitutes, to the best of each Credit Party's knowledge,
Eligible Inventory.

          (e)    LOCK-BOX ARRANGEMENTS. All Lock-Box Banks (names and
addresses), Lock-Box numbers and Lock-Box Account numbers are listed on EXHIBIT
1.1(b) or described in a notice provided pursuant to SECTION 11.1. The Funds
Administrator has sent a copy of all Lock-Box Letters to the Collateral Agent
and Administrative Agent. No Credit Party has granted any interest in any
Lock-Box or Lock-Box Account to any Person other than the Collateral Agent (or
except as permitted by SECTION 8.1(i) hereof) and, upon delivery to a Lock-Box
Bank of the related Lock-Box Letter, the Collateral Agent will have exclusive
ownership and control of the Lock-Box Account and/or Lock-Box at such Lock-Box
Bank.

          (f)    DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. All domestic Deposit Accounts and
disbursement accounts of Borrowers and their Restricted Subsidiaries whose
balances exceed $100,000 as of the Closing Date are listed on SCHEDULE 6.21(f).
No Borrower and no Subsidiary of a Borrower has granted any interest in any such
Deposit Account or disbursement account to any Person other than pursuant to the
Security Documents or the "Security Documents" as such term is defined in the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

          6.22   CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. Since October 31, 2001, no Borrower
and no Restricted Subsidiary of a Borrower has made any charitable contributions
except as would have been permitted pursuant to SECTION 8.17 if it had been in
effect at such time.

          6.23   ASBESTOS MATTERS. No Borrower and no Subsidiary of a Borrower
(a) manufactures, produces or sells any product containing asbestos; or (b) has
manufactured, produced or sold any product containing asbestos prior to the
Effective Date which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          6.24   USE OF PROCEEDS. All proceeds of the Revolving Loans shall be
used: (i) to refinance all outstanding obligations under the Receivables Credit
Agreement, (ii) to pay expenses incurred in connection with restructuring the
Borrowers' and their Subsidiaries' Indebtedness, (iii) to pay other operating
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business, and (iv) for general
corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, proceeds of the Revolving
Loans shall not be used to make voluntary prepayments of the obligations under
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

          The Borrowers hereby agree that, so long as any of the Revolving
Commitments remain in effect, or any Loan or LC Obligation remains outstanding
and unpaid or any other amount is owing to any Lender or Administrative Agent
hereunder, the Borrowers shall:

companies engaged in the same or similar business or having similar properties
similarly situated) may be effected through self-insurance, provided adequate
reserves therefor, in accordance with GAAP, are maintained. All insurance

each of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the exercise of its reasonable business
judgment, to take prompt and appropriate action to respond to any material
non-compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or to
any material Release or a substantial threat of a material Release of a
Contaminant, and upon request from Administrative Agent, shall regularly report
to Administrative Agent on such response. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, whenever Administrative Agent or any Lender has a reasonable basis to
believe that a Borrower is not in material compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or that any property of a Borrower
or its Subsidiaries, or any property to which Contaminants generated by a
Borrower or its Subsidiaries have come to be located ("OFFSITE PROPERTY") has or
may become contaminated or subject to an order or decree such that any
non-compliance, contamination or order or decree could reasonably be anticipated
to have a Material Adverse Effect, then, to the extent a Borrower has the legal
right to do so, such Borrower agrees to, at Administrative Agent's request and
such Borrower's expense: (i) cause an independent environmental engineer
reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent to conduct such tests of the site
where the alleged or actual non-compliance or contamination has occurred and
prepare and deliver to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and such Borrower a
report(s) reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent setting forth the
results of such tests, such Borrower's proposed plan and schedule for responding
to any environmental problems described therein, and such Borrower's estimate of
the costs thereof; and (ii) provide Administrative Agent, the Lenders and such
Borrower a supplemental report(s) of such engineer whenever the scope of the
environmental problems or such Borrower's response thereto or the estimated
costs thereof, shall materially change. Notwithstanding the above, such Borrower
shall not be obligated (other than as required by applicable law) to undertake
any tests or remediation at any Offsite Property that (a) is not owned or
operated by such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) where Contaminants
generated by persons other than such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have
also come to be located.

                                       97

each of its Restricted Subsidiaries, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and their respective employees, agents,
officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties,
fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or
nature known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, arising out of, or in any way
relating to the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any
Environmental Law applicable to the operations of such Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties, or any orders, requirements or
demands of Governmental Authorities related thereto, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney's and consultant's fees, investigation and
laboratory fees, response costs, court costs and litigation expenses, except to
the extent that any of the foregoing arise out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification therefor. The agreements
in this SECTION 7.9(b) shall survive repayment of the Notes and all other
Obligations.

          7.10   ADDITIONAL SECURITY; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

          (a)    AGREEMENT TO GRANT ADDITIONAL SECURITY. Promptly, and in any
event within thirty (30) days after the acquisition by a Borrower or any of its
Restricted Domestic Subsidiaries of assets or real or personal property of the

which the Collateral Agent does not have a perfected security interest under the
Security Documents (other than (v) equipment subject to Liens permitted under
SECTION 8.1(b) under agreements which prohibit the creation of additional Liens
on such assets, (w) the property subject to the Headquarters Mortgage Loan
Documents, (x) Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (which is governed by clause (c)

$5,000,000) or promptly following request by Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent with respect to any other collateral deemed material by
Administrative Agent or Required Lenders (the "ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL"), the
Borrowers will, and will cause each of their Restricted Domestic Subsidiaries

statements under the provisions of the UCC, applicable foreign, domestic or
local laws, rules or regulations in each of the offices where such filing is

to and to the full extent required by the Security Documents and this Agreement.

          (b)    ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES AND INTERCOMPANY NOTES. Each
Borrower agrees to cause each Restricted Domestic Subsidiary (other than IRIC)

<Page>

Restricted Subsidiary established or created to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant to the Security Agreement; PROVIDED that
the pledge of the Capital Stock of any new Restricted Subsidiary which is a

treated as equity under the Code shall, (i) only be required to the extent owned

within 10 Business Days of the acquisition thereof or such longer period as the
Administrative Agent may approve. No Foreign Subsidiary may be or become a
shareholder of a Domestic Subsidiary.

          (d)    GRANT OF SECURITY BY NEW SUBSIDIARIES. Subject to the
provisions of SECTIONS 7.10(a) and 7.10(c), Each Borrower will cause each
Restricted Domestic Subsidiary established or created in accordance with SECTION
8.7 to grant to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties
pursuant to the Security Agreement a first priority Lien (subject to Permitted

Borrower will cause each of its Restricted Domestic Subsidiaries to take all
actions requested by Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (including,
without limitation, the filing of UCC-1's) in connection with the granting of
such security interests.

          (e)    PLEDGE OF EQUITY IN UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES. Each Borrower
agrees to pledge (or cause its Restricted Domestic Subsidiaries to pledge) all
of the Capital Stock owned by such Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries of
each new Unrestricted Subsidiary established or created after the Closing Date
to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant to the
Security Agreement other than a Foreign Subsidiary with Consolidated Total
Assets of $1,000,000 or less as long as the Consolidated Total Assets of all

Restated Credit Agreement or the agreement governing Permitted Junior Debt or
any extension, replacement or refinancing thereof which is not otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement;

          (b)    any such encumbrance or restriction consisting of customary

through the Administrative Agent or otherwise and (iii) relevant prior financial
statements that are affected by such change are restated (in form and detail

to in SECTION 6.5(a) hereof occur after the Closing Date and such changes result
in, in the sole judgment of Administrative Agent, a meaningful change in the
calculation of any financial covenants or restrictions set forth in this
Agreement, then the parties hereto agree to enter into and diligently pursue
negotiations to amend the covenants employing financial calculations herein so
as to equitably reflect such changes, with the desired result that the criteria
for evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of the

any Contract to the extent related thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each
Borrower and each Credit Party may grant rebates, extensions, or adjustments in
the ordinary course of business PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such extension or
adjustment shall not affect the aging of such Receivable (which shall be

<Page>

          (l)    HOLDCO AGREEMENT BREACH. A "Default" (as defined in the Holdco

notice (in the case of oral or telephonic notice confirmed in writing
immediately thereafter) to the Funds Administrator declare the Commitments to be

or oral or telephonic notice (in the case of oral or telephonic notice confirmed
in writing immediately thereafter) to the Funds Administrator declare all sums
then owing by the Borrowers hereunder and under the Loan Documents to be
forthwith due and payable, whereupon all such sums shall become and be
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, (iii)
terminate any Letter of Credit which may be terminated in accordance with its
terms, (iv) direct the Borrowers to pay (and the Borrowers agree that upon
receipt of such notice, or upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified
in SECTION 10.1(e) or SECTION 10.1(f) with respect to the Borrowers they will
pay) to Administrative Agent at the Payment Office such additional amount of
cash, to be held as security by Administrative Agent, as is equal to 105% of the

Borrowers and its subsidiaries and then outstanding and (v) enforce, as
Administrative Agent (to the extent permitted under the applicable Loan
Documents), or direct the Collateral Agent to enforce, pursuant to the terms of
the Security Agreement, any of the liens and security interests created pursuant
to the Security Documents. In cases of any occurrence of any Event of Default
described in CLAUSE (e) or (f) of this SECTION 10.1, the Commitments shall
terminate and the Loans, together with accrued interest thereon, shall become
due and payable forthwith without the requirement of any such acceleration or
request, and without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are expressly waived by the Borrowers, any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, and other
amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder shall also become immediately due and
payable all without notice of any kind.

                                       118
<Page>

          Anything in this SECTION 10.1 to the contrary notwithstanding,
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Required Lenders, rescind and
annul any acceleration of the Loans and termination of the Commitments by
written instrument filed with the Funds Administrator; PROVIDED that at the time
such acceleration is so rescinded and annulled: (A) all past due interest and
principal (other than principal due solely as a result of such acceleration), if
any, on the Loans and all other sums payable under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall have been duly paid, and (B) no other Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing which shall not have been waived in
accordance with the provisions of SECTION 13.1 hereof. Upon any such rescission
and annulment, Administrative Agent shall return to the Borrowers any cash
collateral delivered pursuant to the preceding paragraph.

          10.2   RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE. The rights provided for in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
rights, powers, privileges or remedies provided by law or in equity, or under
any other instrument, document or agreement now existing or hereafter arising.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATION

          11.1   LOCK-BOX AND MASTER COLLECTION ACCOUNT ARRANGEMENTS. The
Borrowers and the Credit Parties shall deliver to Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent a Lock-Box Letter with respect to each of its Lock-Boxes and
Lock-Box Accounts. Each such Lock-Box Letter shall direct that all collected and
available funds on deposit in such Lock-Box Accounts are to be remitted on a
daily basis by electronic wire or ACH transfer to the Master Collection Account.
In addition to the above-described Lock-Box Letters, the Borrowers shall deliver
to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (on or prior to the date hereof or
of any relocation of such account to any other financial institution a Master
Collection Account Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
EXHIBIT 11.1 (a "MASTER COLLECTION ACCOUNT AGREEMENT"), executed by the
applicable Borrowers and the applicable bank at which such account is then being
maintained (the "MASTER COLLECTION ACCOUNT BANK") and covering the Master
Collection Account. Each Borrower and each Credit Party hereby grant to
Collateral Agent exclusive dominion and control of all of the Lock-Box Accounts,
the Lock-Boxes and the Master Collection Account (and all funds deposited, or to
be deposited, therein), with all rights to, among other things, at any time (i)
give notices to each Lock-Box Bank or the Master Collection Account Bank, as
applicable, (ii) direct the disposition of all Collections that are sent to any
of the Lock-Boxes and the Lock-Box Accounts to the Master Collection Account,
and all Collections that are on deposit in the Master Collection Account in
accordance with the terms hereof, and (iii) take all other actions permitted
under the Lock-Box Letters and the Master Collection Account Agreement. Unless
directed to do so by Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, no Borrower
shall have authority to, nor shall it terminate any bank as the Master
Collection Account Bank, add any other financial institution as a Master
Collection Account Bank, or consent to the transfer of any funds from any
Lock-Box Bank to any financial institution other than the Master Collection
Account Bank. To the extent a Borrower is directed by Collateral Agent to move
the Master Collection Account to a different account or to a

                                      119
<Page>

different financial institution, such Borrower shall deliver to Collateral Agent
a new or revised Master Collection Account Agreement, as applicable, executed by
such Borrower and the Master Collection Account Bank or new Master Collection
Account Bank, as applicable, relating to such new Master Collection Account, in
any case, prior to the designation of such account as the Master Collection
Account. If notwithstanding the directions in the Lock-Box Letters and this
Agreement, any Borrower receives any Collections directly, it hereby agrees to
remit such Collections (within one (1) Business Day thereafter) to the Master
Collection Account in the identical form as received by it (with any necessary
endorsements). Prior to its turnover of such Collections, such Borrower shall
hold any such Collections received by it in trust for the Collateral Agent.

          11.2   REPORTS. (a) No later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on each
Report Date, the Company shall prepare and forward to Administrative Agent a
report (certified therein as true and correct by a Responsible Financial Officer
of the Company) reflecting information as of the close of business of the
Borrowers for the immediately preceding calendar month (a "MONTHLY REPORT"),
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 11.2(a) including but not limited to
monthly aging and concentration of Receivables and monthly listing of Inventory
(and containing such additional information in respect of the Inventory,
Receivables and the Obligors as is from time to time requested by Administrative
Agent).

          (b)    No later than 5:00 P.M. (Chicago time) on the second Business
Day following the end of each calendar week, the Company shall deliver to
Administrative Agent a report (each a "WEEKLY REPORT") substantially in the form
of EXHIBIT 11.2(b) reflecting information as of the close of business of the
Borrowers for the immediately preceding calendar week (and containing such
additional information as from time to time may be requested by Administrative
Agent). The Company shall promptly provide more frequent reports upon the
request of Administrative Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default.

          (c)    To the extent Administrative Agent disagrees with any of the
computations set forth in any such Monthly Report or Weekly Report delivered to
it pursuant to this SECTION 11.2, it may recompute such information and, to the
extent the result of such recomputation differs from the original computation
provided by the Company, Administrative Agent may designate such recomputed
result to be the relevant result until such discrepancy is resolved to the
reasonable satisfaction of Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to confirm the accuracy of any of
the information provided to it by any Borrower in any report (including, without
limitation, any Monthly Report, Weekly Report or otherwise) and shall have no
liability to any Person in connection therewith.

          (d)    Administrative Agent will deliver to any Lender upon its
request therefor a copy of any Monthly Report or Weekly Report previously
delivered to Administrative Agent.

          11.3   ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS. (a) Collateral Agent may, at any time upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, direct the
Obligors and the Lock-Box Banks to make all payments with respect to the
Receivables directly to the Master Collection Account. Collateral Agent may, and
the Funds Administrator shall at Collateral

                                       120
<Page>

Agent's request, withhold the identity of the Lenders from the Obligors and
Lock-Box Banks. Upon Collateral Agent's request at any time during an Event of
Default, the Funds Administrator (at the Borrower's expense) shall, or shall
cause any applicable Credit Party to, (i) give notice to each Obligor of the
Collateral Agent's lien on the Receivables and direct that payments be made
directly to Collateral Agent or its designee and (ii) assemble all of the
Related Security and transfer, or license the use of, all software necessary or
desirable to collect the Receivables and the Related Security to Collateral
Agent or its designee at a place selected by Collateral Agent and (iii)
segregate all cash, checks and other instruments received by it which constitute
Collections in a manner acceptable to Collateral Agent.

          (b)    Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Collateral Agent as
its attorney-in-fact coupled with an interest, with full power of substitution
and with full authority in the place and stead of such Borrower, to take any and
all steps in the name, and on behalf, of such Borrower necessary or desirable,
in the determination of Collateral Agent, (i) to collect any amounts due under
any Receivables or Related Security, including endorsing the name of such
Borrower or any Credit Party on checks and other instruments representing
Collections and enforcing such Receivables and Related Security. The Borrowers'
conferring of powers upon Collateral Agent under this SECTION 11.3(b) shall not
subject Collateral Agent to any liability if any action taken by it shall prove
to be inadequate or invalid, nor shall it confer any obligations upon Collateral
Agent in any manner whatsoever.

          (c)    Neither Administrative Agent nor the Lenders shall have any
obligation to take any action or commence any proceedings to realize upon any
Receivable or to enforce any of their respective rights, powers, privileges or
remedies with respect thereto.

          11.4   RESPONSIBILITIES OF BORROWERS. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each Borrower shall (a) perform all of its obligations under
the Contracts related to the Receivables to the same extent as if such
Receivables had not been pledged under the Security Documents (the exercise by
Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender of its rights hereunder
shall not relieve the Borrowers or any Credit Party from such obligations) and
(b) pay when due any Taxes payable in connection with the Receivables or their
creation or satisfaction. Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall neither have any obligation or liability with respect to any Receivable
nor be obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Borrowers or any
Credit Party under any of the foregoing (including under any Contract with
respect thereto).

                                  ARTICLE XII

                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

          In this ARTICLE XII, the Lenders agree among themselves as follows:

          12.1   APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints,
designates and authorizes Administrative Agent (for purposes of this Agreement,
the term Administrative Agent shall include Administrative Agent in its capacity
as Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as herein
specified. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each

                                       121
<Page>

holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to
authorize, Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, to give notices
and take such actions on behalf of the Required Lenders as are consented to in
writing by the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) and any
other instruments, documents and agreements referred to therein and to exercise
such powers hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent may perform any of its
duties hereunder, or under the Loan Documents, by or through its officers,
directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

          12.2   NATURE OF DUTIES. Administrative Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement.
The duties of Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature. EACH LENDER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
SHALL NOT HAVE, BY REASON OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, A
FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP TO OR IN RESPECT OF ANY LENDER. Nothing in any of the
Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as
to impose upon Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of any of the
Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Each Lender
shall make its own independent investigation of the financial condition and
affairs of the Borrowers in connection with the making and the continuance of
the Loans hereunder and shall make its own appraisal of the credit worthiness of
the Borrowers, and Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into
its possession before making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter.
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender at any time that the
Required Lenders have instructed it to act or refrain from acting pursuant to
ARTICLE X.

          12.3   RIGHTS, EXCULPATION, ETC. Neither Administrative Agent nor any
of its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be liable to
any Lender for any action taken or omitted by it hereunder or under any of the
Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or
their gross negligence or willful misconduct. Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
enforceability, collectibility, or sufficiency of any of the Loan Documents or
any other document or the financial condition of the Borrowers. Administrative
Agent shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or any other document or the financial
condition of the Borrowers, or the existence or possible existence of any
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default unless requested to do so by the
Required Lenders. Administrative Agent may at any time request instructions from
the Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals (including the failure to
act or approve) which by the terms of any of the Loan Documents Administrative
Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant, and if such instructions are
requested, Administrative Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from
taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any
liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding
any approval under any of the Loan

                                       122
<Page>

Documents until it shall have received such instructions from the Required
Lenders or all Lenders, as applicable. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender
shall have any right of action whatsoever against Administrative Agent as a
result of either Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting or
approving under any of the Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of
the Required Lenders or, to the extent required by SECTION 12.1, all of the
Lenders.

          12.4   RELIANCE. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any written notice, statement,
certificate, order or other document or any telephone, telex, teletype,
telecopier or electronic message reasonably believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and, with
respect to all matters pertaining herein or to any of the other Loan Documents
and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.

          12.5   INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent that Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrowers, the Lenders will reimburse and
indemnify Administrative Agent for and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against Administrative Agent, acting pursuant
hereto in such capacity, in any way relating to or arising out of any of the
Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent under any
of the Loan Documents, in proportion to each Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The obligations of the Lenders under this
SECTION 12.5 shall survive the payment in full of the Notes and the termination
of this Agreement.

          12.6   ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. With respect
to its Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise
the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and
liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other Lender or holder
of Obligations. The terms "Lenders", "holder of Obligations" or "Required
Lenders" or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise
indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a
Lender, one of the Required Lenders or a holder of Obligations. The
Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with any Borrower or any
Subsidiary of any Borrower as if it were not acting as the Administrative Agent
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, including the acceptance of fees or
other consideration for services without having to account for the same to any
of the Lenders.

          12.7   NOTICE OF DEFAULTS. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or Unmatured
Event of Default hereunder unless Administrative Agent has received written
notice from a Lender or any Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such
Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". In the event Administrative Agent receives such a notice,
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

                                       123
<Page>

          12.8   HOLDERS OF OBLIGATIONS. Administrative Agent may deem and treat
the payee of any Obligation as reflected on the books and records of
Administrative Agent as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with Administrative Agent pursuant to SECTION 13.9(c). Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Obligation shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such
Obligation or of any Obligation or Obligations granted in exchange therefor.

          12.9   ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO DEFAULTS. In addition to the
Administrative Agent's right to take actions on its own accord as permitted
under this Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall take such action
with respect to a Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by the
Required Lenders; provided that until the Administrative Agent shall have
received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable and in the best
interests of the Lenders and the Facing Banks; and, further, provided that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required under any circumstances to take any
action that, in its judgment, (a) is contrary to any provision of the Loan
Documents or applicable law or (b) will expose it to any liability or expense
against which it has not been indemnified to its satisfaction. If any indemnity
furnished to Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, Administrative Agent
may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts
indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.

          12.10  RESIGNATION.

          (a)    Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its
functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving fifteen (15) Business Days'
prior written notice to the Funds Administrator and the Lenders. Such
resignation shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Administrative
Agent of appointment pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) below.

          (b)    Upon any such notice of resignation by Administrative Agent,
Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall be
satisfactory to the Funds Administrator and shall be an incorporated bank or
trust company.

          (c)    If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so
appointed within said 15 Business Day period, Administrative Agent, with the
consent of the Funds Administrator, shall then appoint its successor who shall
serve as Administrative Agent, as the case may be, until such time, if any, as
the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Funds Administrator, appoint a
successor as provided above.

          (d)    If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed
pursuant to clause (b) or (c), by the 20th Business Day after the date such
notice of resignation was given by Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
such resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall
thereafter perform all the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder until

                                       124
<Page>

such time, if any, as the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Funds
Administrator, appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          13.1   NO WAIVER; MODIFICATIONS IN WRITING. No failure or delay on the
part of Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
remedies that may be available to Administrative Agent or any Lender at law or
in equity or otherwise. No amendment, modification, supplement, termination or
waiver of or to any provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by
any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries therefrom, shall be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the Required Lenders and
the Borrowers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amendment, modification,
supplement, termination, waiver or consent, as the case may be, shall (A) reduce
the rate of interest or extend the final maturity of the Revolving Commitments
(but excluding any change relating to waiver of the applicability of the Default
Rate or any mandatory or voluntary repayment of any principal sum payable by any
Borrower to any Lender hereunder or any mandatory commitment reduction of the
Revolving Commitment related to any mandatory prepayment other than the
mandatory commitment reduction at the end of the Commitment Period), or the date
for payment of any fees or interest on any Loan, or Letter of Credit or any date
for reimbursement of any Letter of Credit Payment or waive or excuse any such
payment or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan or
Letter of Credit Payment, or amend the definition of "Borrowing Base" to
increase the advance rate percentages specified therein to a level higher than
that existing on the date hereof, without the prior written consent of each
holder of a Note or Lender affected thereby, (B) without the prior written
consent of the affected Lender, increase the Commitment of any Lender, extend
any Commitment, decrease the principal amount of any Loan or fees owed to any
Lender hereunder or change the Revolving Pro Rata Share of any Lender, or,
without the prior written consent of all Lenders, increase the amount of the
Commitments, (C) change this SECTION 13.1 or the definitions of the terms
"Required Lenders" or "Revolving Pro Rata Share," without the prior written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, or (D) other than as expressly
permitted in SECTION 13.16, effect any release of any material portion of the
Collateral during the term of this Agreement or release of any Borrower or
Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor which is not a Material
Subsidiary) from all or substantially all its obligations under the Subsidiary
Guarantee Agreement or amend any of the Loan Documents to change the first lien
nature of the Collateral without the prior written consent of all Lenders
hereunder (other than as a result of a transaction permitted by SECTION 8.3 or
an Asset Disposition made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(including any amendments thereto permitted hereby) or as otherwise permitted
pursuant to the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement); and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no
such amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent, as the
case may be, which has the effect of (x) increasing the duties or obligations of
Administrative Agent hereunder, (y)

                                       125
<Page>

increasing the standard of care or performance required on the part of
Administrative Agent hereunder, or (z) reducing or eliminating the fees,
indemnities or immunities to which Administrative Agent is entitled hereunder
(including, without limitation, any amendment or modification of this SECTION
13.1(a)), shall be effective unless the same shall be signed by or on behalf of
Administrative Agent; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that no such amendment,
modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent, as the case may be,
affecting the rights or duties of any Facing Bank under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, shall be effective unless the same shall be signed by such
Facing Bank. Any amendment, modification or supplement of or to any provision of
this Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and any consent
to any departure by the Borrowers from the terms of any provision of this
Agreement, shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is specifically required by
any Loan Document, no notice to or demand on a Borrower in any case shall
entitle any Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances.

          13.2   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Borrower agrees to do such further
acts and things and to execute and deliver to Administrative Agent such
additional assignments, agreements, powers and instruments, as Administrative
Agent may reasonably require or deem advisable to carry into effect the purposes
of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or to better assure and confirm
unto Administrative Agent its rights, powers and remedies hereunder.

          13.3   NOTICES, ETC. Except where telephonic instructions or notices
are authorized herein to be given, all notices, demands, instructions and other
communications required or permitted to be given to or made upon any party
hereto or any other Person shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered
or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, or by a reputable overnight or courier delivery service, or by
telecopier, and shall be deemed to be given for purposes of this Agreement on
the third day after deposit in registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
and otherwise on the day that such writing is delivered or sent to the intended
recipient thereof, or in the case of notice delivered by telecopy, upon
completion of transmission with a copy of such notice also being delivered under
any of the other methods provided above, all in accordance with the provisions
of this SECTION 13.3. Unless otherwise specified in a notice sent or delivered
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this SECTION 13.3, notices,
demands, instructions and other communications in writing shall be given to or
made upon the respective parties hereto at their respective addresses (or to
their respective telecopier numbers) indicated on its signature page to this
Agreement or, in the case of any Assignee, on its signature page to its
Assignment and Assumption Agreement and, in the case of telephonic instructions
or notices, by calling the telephone number or numbers indicated for such party
on its signature page to this Agreement or such Assignment or Assumption
Agreement, as the case may be.

          13.4   COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES.

          (a)    GENERALLY. Each Borrower agrees without duplication to pay
promptly upon request by Administrative Agent all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, printing, typing, reproduction, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the

                                       126
<Page>

documents and instruments referred to herein and therein and any amendment,
waiver, consent relating hereto or thereto or other modifications of (or
supplements to) any of the foregoing and any and all other documents and
instruments furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith, including without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket
expenses of Winston & Strawn, special counsel to Administrative Agent, and any
local counsel retained by Administrative Agent relative thereto, other Attorney
Costs, independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by
Administrative Agent in connection with the administration of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, and all search fees, appraisal fees and expenses,
title insurance policy fees, costs and expenses and filing and recording fees
and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, Attorney Costs), if
any, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, any of the Loan
Documents or any other agreement furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith. In addition, each Borrower shall pay any and
all present and future stamp, transfer, excise and other similar taxes payable
or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, any Loan Document, or the making of any Loan, and agrees to save
and hold Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and
all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay by such Borrower in
paying, or omission by such Borrower to pay, such taxes. Any portion of the
foregoing fees, costs and expenses which remains unpaid more than thirty (30)
days following Administrative Agent's or any Lender's statement and request for
payment thereof shall bear interest from the date of such statement and request
to the date of payment at the Default Rate.

          (b)    INDEMNIFICATION. Borrowers will jointly and severally indemnify
and hold harmless Administrative Agent and each Lender and each director,
officer, employee, agent, attorney, trustee, advisor and Affiliate of
Administrative Agent and each Lender (each such Person an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON"
and collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") from and against all losses,
claims, damages, obligations (including removal or remedial actions), expenses
or liabilities (not including Taxes as to which a Borrower is not required to
make any payment of additional amounts pursuant to SECTION 4.7(c) hereof) to
which such Indemnified Person may become subject, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages, penalties, obligations (including removal or remedial actions),
expenses or liabilities (or actions, suits or proceedings including any inquiry
or investigation or claims in respect thereof (whether or not Administrative
Agent or any Lender is a party thereto)) arise out of, in any way relate to, or
result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents and to reimburse each Indemnified Person upon their demand, for
any Attorney Costs or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
preparing to defend or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action
or claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,

                 (i)    that no Indemnified Person shall have the right to be so
     indemnified hereunder for any loss, claim, damage, penalties, obligations,
     expense or liability to the extent it arises or results from the gross
     negligence or willful misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnified Person as
     finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and

                 (ii)   that nothing contained herein shall affect the
     obligations and liabilities of the Lenders to the Borrowers contained
     herein.

                                       127
<Page>

                 (iii)  If any action, suit or proceeding arising from any of
     the foregoing is brought against Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
     other Person indemnified or intended to be indemnified pursuant to this
     SECTION 13.4, the Borrowers will, if requested by Administrative Agent, any
     Lender or any such Indemnified Person, resist and defend such action, suit
     or proceeding or cause the same to be resisted and defended by counsel
     reasonably satisfactory to the Person or Persons indemnified or intended to
     be indemnified. Each Indemnified Person shall, unless Administrative Agent,
     a Lender or other Indemnified Person has made the request described in the
     preceding sentence and such request has been complied with, have the right
     to employ its own counsel (or (but not as well as) staff counsel) to
     investigate and control the defense of any matter covered by such indemnity
     and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
     expense of the indemnifying party. Excluding any liability to the extent
     arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
     Indemnified Person as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
     final non-appealable judgment, the Borrowers further agree to indemnify and
     hold each Indemnified Person harmless from all loss, cost (including
     Attorney Costs), liability and damage whatsoever incurred by any
     Indemnified Person by reason of any violation of any Environmental Laws or
     Environmental Permits or for the Release or Threatened Release of any
     Contaminants into the environment for which any Borrower or any of its
     Subsidiaries has any liability or which occurs upon the Mortgaged Property
     or which is related to any property currently or formerly owned, leased or
     operated by or on behalf of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or by
     reason of the imposition of any Environmental Lien or which occurs by a
     breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants relating to
     environmental matters contained herein, including, without limitation, by
     reason of any matters disclosed in SCHEDULE 6.17, provided that, with
     respect to any liabilities arising from acts or failure to act for which
     any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is strictly liable under any
     Environmental Law or Environmental Permit, such Borrower's obligation to
     each Indemnified Person under this indemnity shall likewise be without
     regard to fault on the part of any Borrower or any such Subsidiary. If the
     Borrowers shall fail to do any act or thing which it has covenanted to do
     hereunder or any representation or warranty on the part of any Borrower or
     any Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be
     breached, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) do the
     same or cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and may expend its
     funds for such purpose, and will use its best efforts to give prompt
     written notice to the Funds Administrator that it proposes to take such
     action. Any and all amounts so expended by Administrative Agent shall be
     repaid to it by the Borrowers promptly upon Administrative Agent's demand
     therefor, with interest at the Default Rate in effect from time to time
     during the period including the date so expended by Administrative Agent to
     the date of repayment. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay
     or hold harmless Administrative Agent or any Lender as set forth in this
     SECTION 13.4 may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or
     public policy, the Borrowers shall make the maximum contribution to the
     payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities which is
     permissible under applicable law. The obligations of the Borrowers under
     this SECTION 13.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
     discharge of the Borrowers' other Obligations hereunder.

          13.5   DEFAULTING LENDER.

          (a)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Lender that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent a
Loan required to be made by it pursuant to SECTION 2.2 or its participation
pursuant to SECTION 2.5(d)(ii), Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such amounts available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
such Sections and the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers, pursuant to the
directions of the Funds Administrator, or the applicable Facing Bank a
corresponding amount on behalf of such Lender.

          (b)    If any amount referred to in SECTION 13.5(a) or in SECTION 4.9
is not made available to the Administrative Agent by a Lender (a "DEFAULTING
LENDER") and the Administrative Agent has made such amount available to the
Borrowers or a Facing Bank, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
recover such amount on demand from such Defaulting Lender together with interest
as hereinafter provided. If such Defaulting Lender does not pay such amount
forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefore, Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Borrowers shall immediately (but in
no event later than five Business Days after such demand) pay such amount to the
Administrative Agent together with interest calculated as hereinafter provided.
The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Defaulting
Lender and/or the Borrowers, as the case may be, (i) interest on such amount in
respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available
by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers to the date such amount is
recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to either (A)
if paid by such Defaulting Lender, the Federal Funds Rate or (B) if paid by the
Borrowers, the then applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with
SECTION 3.1, PLUS (ii) in each case, an amount equal to any costs (including
legal expenses) and losses incurred as a result of the failure of such
Defaulting Lender to provide such amount as provided in this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its duty to fulfill its
obligations hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrowers or the
Facing Bank, may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such
Lender hereunder, including the right of the Borrowers to seek reimbursement
from any Defaulting Lender for any amounts paid by the Borrowers under clause
(ii) above on account of such Defaulting Lender's default.

          (c)    (i)    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
     contrary, so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or has rejected its
     Commitment, the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to
     such Lender any payments made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent
     for the benefit of such Lender; and such Lender shall not be entitled to
     the sharing of any payments pursuant to SECTION 4.10. Amounts otherwise
     payable to such Lender under SECTION 4.10 shall instead be paid to the
     Administrative Agent. For so long as any Lender shall be in default for a
     period of at least 2 Business Days of its obligation to fund its Revolving
     Pro Rata Share of any Loan, no fees shall be accrued by or paid to such
     Lender.

                 (ii)   For purposes of voting or consenting to matters with
     respect to the Loan Documents and determining Revolving Pro Rata Share,
     such Defaulting Lender

                                       129
<Page>

     shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" and such Lender's Commitment shall be
     deemed to be zero (0).

                 (iii)  This SECTION 13.5(c) shall remain effective with respect
     to a Defaulting Lender until (A) the Obligations under this Agreement shall
     have been declared or shall have become immediately due and payable or (B)
     the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Funds Administrator
     shall have waived such Lender's default in writing.

                 (iv)   No Lender's Commitment shall be increased or otherwise
     affected, and performance by the respective Borrower shall not be excused,
     by the operation of this SECTION 13.5(c). Any payments of principal or
     interest which would, but for this SECTION 13.5(c), be paid to any Lender,
     shall be paid to the Lenders who shall not be in default under their
     respective Commitments and who shall not have rejected any Commitment, for
     application to the Loans then due and payable or to the other Obligations
     then due and payable or to provide cash collateral to secure Obligations
     not then due and payable in such manner and order as shall be determined by
     the Administrative Agent.

          13.6   CONFIRMATIONS. Each Borrower and each holder of any portion of
the Obligations agrees from time to time, upon written request received by it
from the other, to confirm to the other in writing (with a copy of each such
confirmation to Administrative Agent) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
the Loan or Loans and other Obligations then outstanding.

          13.7   SETOFF; RECOUPMENT.

          (a)    In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Funds
Administrator, any such notice being expressly waived by the Funds
Administrator, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, to setoff and apply against any Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, of the Borrowers to such Lender, any amount owing from such Lender to
the Borrowers, at or at any time after, the happening of any of the
above-mentioned events, and the aforesaid right of setoff may be exercised by
such Lender against the Borrowers or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor
in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution,
judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrowers, or against anyone else
claiming through or against, the Borrowers or such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor
in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution,
judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of
setoff shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the making, filing
or issuance, or service upon such Lender of, or of notice of, any such petition,
assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the
appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant.
Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Funds Administrator and Administrative
Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, PROVIDED that
the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and
application.

                                       130
<Page>

          (b)    Borrowers expressly agree that to the extent the Borrowers make
a payment or payments and such payment or payments, or any part thereof, are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or are required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other party under
any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to
the extent of such payment or repayment, the Indebtedness to the Lenders or part
thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force
and effect as if said payment or payments had not been made.

          13.8   EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto on separate
counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall
be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same Agreement.

          13.9   BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; ADDITION AND SUBSTITUTION OF
LENDERS.

          (a)    This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the Borrowers, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, the Lenders, all
future holders of the Notes and their respective successors and assigns;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrowers may not assign their rights or obligations
hereunder or in connection herewith or any interest herein (voluntarily, by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent and all of the Lenders.

          (b)    Each Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other
entities ("PARTICIPANTS") participating interests in all or any portion of its
Commitment and Loans or participation in Letters of Credit or any other interest
of such Lender hereunder (in respect of any Lender, its "CREDIT EXPOSURE"). In
the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
Participant, such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, and the Funds Administrator and Administrative Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. At the time of each sale of a
participating interest, pursuant to this SECTION 13.8(b), the Lender shall
provide to the Funds Administrator or Administrative Agent revised IRS Forms,
and if applicable, a Section 4.8(d)(ii) Certificate described in SECTION 4.8(d),
reflecting that portion of its Commitment and Loan retained by it on an amended
IRS Form W-8BEN and that portion of its Commitment and Loan which had been sold
to a Participant on a IRS Form W-8IMY (together with any required attachments).
The Borrowers agree that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have
become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such right of setoff shall be subject to the
obligation of such Participant to share with the Lenders, and the Lenders agree
to share with such Participant, as provided in SECTION 4.10. The Borrowers also
agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of SECTION 3.5 and
4.8 with respect to its participation in the Loans outstanding from time to
time, provided that such Participant's benefits under SECTIONS 3.5 and 4.8

                                       131
<Page>

shall be limited to the benefits that the primary Lender would be entitled to
thereunder. Each Lender agrees that any agreement between such Lender and any
such Participant in respect of such participating interest shall not restrict
such Lender's right to approve or agree to any amendment, restatement,
supplement or other modification to, waiver of, or consent under, this Agreement
or any of the Loan Documents except to the extent that any of the forgoing would
(i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in which such
Participant is participating or extend the stated maturity of any Letter of
Credit in which such Participant is participating beyond the Commitment
Termination Date, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
or fees on any such Loan, Note or Letter of Credit (except in connection with a
waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates) or
reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the Participant's
participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that
waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Events of Default
or Unmatured Events of Default or of a mandatory reduction in Commitments shall
not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase
in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any
Participant if the Participant's participation is not increased as a result
thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrowers of any of
their rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or
substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security Documents (except
as expressly provided in the Loan Documents) supporting the Loans and/or Letters
of Credit hereunder in which such Participant is participating.

          (c)    Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees, including an Affiliate thereof (treating any Related Fund as a single
Eligible Assignee) (each an "ASSIGNEE"), all or any part of its Credit Exposure
pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, PROVIDED that (i) it assigns
its Credit Exposure in an amount not less than $1,000,000 with respect to
Revolving Loans, and (ii) any assignment of all or any portion of any Lender's
Credit Exposure to an Assignee other than an Affiliate of such Lender or another
Lender, or in the case of a Lender that is a fund that invests in senior loans,
any Related Fund, shall require the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Funds Administrator (the consent of the Funds Administrator and the
Administrative Agent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that for the first fifteen Business Days following the Closing Date,
assignments by Administrative Agent shall not require the consent of the Funds
Administrator) and PROVIDED FURTHER, that notwithstanding the foregoing
limitations, any Lender may at any time assign all or any part of its Credit
Exposure to any Affiliate of such Lender or to any other Lender (or in the case
of a Lender which is a fund, any Related Fund). Upon execution of an Assignment
and Assumption Agreement and the payment of a nonrefundable assignment fee of
$3,500 (provided that no such fee shall be payable upon assignments by any
Lender which is a fund that invests in bank loans to any Related Fund in
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at its Payment Office in
connection with each such assignment, written notice thereof by such transferor
Lender to the Administrative Agent and the recording by the Administrative Agent
in the Register of such assignment and the resulting effect upon the Revolving
Commitment of the assigning Lender and the Assignee, the Assignee shall have, to
the extent of such assignment, the same rights and benefits as it would have if
it were a Lender hereunder and the holder of the Obligations (provided that the
Funds Administrator and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to continue
to deal solely and directly with the assignor Lender in connection with the

                                       132
<Page>

interests so assigned to the Assignee until written notice of such assignment,
together with payment instructions, addresses and related information with
respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to the Funds Administrator and
the Administrative Agent by the assignor Lender and the Assignee) and, if the
Assignee has expressly assumed, for the benefit of the Borrowers, some or all of
the transferor Lender's obligations hereunder, such transferor Lender shall be
relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent of such assignment and
assumption, and except as described above, no further consent or action by any
Borrower, the Funds Administrator, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall
be required. At the time of each assignment pursuant to this SECTION 13.9(c) to
a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for
United States Federal income tax purposes, the respective Assignee shall provide
to the Funds Administrator and the Administrative Agent the appropriate IRS
Forms (and, if applicable a Section 4.8(d)(ii) Certificate) described in SECTION
4.8(d) AND (e). Each Assignee shall take such Credit Exposure subject to the
provisions of this Agreement and to any request made, waiver or consent given or
other action taken hereunder, prior to the receipt by Administrative Agent and
the Funds Administrator of written notice of such transfer, by each previous
holder of such Credit Exposure. Such Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall
be deemed to amend this Agreement and SCHEDULE 1.1(a) hereto, to the extent, and
only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Assignee as a
Lender and the resulting adjustment of all or a portion of the rights and
obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement, the Commitments, the
determination of its Revolving Pro Rata Share (rounded to twelve decimal
places), the Loans, any outstanding Letters of Credit and any new Notes to be
issued, at the Borrowers' expense, to such Assignee, and no further consent or
action by the Borrowers, the Funds Administrator or Lenders shall be required to
effect such amendments.

          (d)    The Borrowers authorize each Lender to disclose to any
Participant or Assignee or its investment advisor (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and any
prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's
possession concerning any Borrower and any Subsidiary of any Borrower which has
been delivered to such Lender by any Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or
which has been delivered to such Lender by such Borrower in connection with such
Lender's credit evaluation of such Borrower prior to entering into this
Agreement; PROVIDED that such Transferee or prospective Transferee agrees to
treat any such information which is not public as confidential in accordance
with SECTION 13.17.

          (e)    Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender may at any time pledge or assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, the Notes held by it) to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board without notice to, or the consent of,
any Borrower or the Funds Administrator; PROVIDED that no such pledge or
assignment of a security interest under this SECTION 13.9(f) shall release a
Lender from any obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee
for such Lender as a party hereto. Any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or
any portion of its Notes or Loans to its trustee (or other similar
representative) in support of its obligations to its trustee. No such pledge or
assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.

          13.13  TRANSFERS OF NOTES. In the event that the holder of any Note
(including any Lender) shall transfer such Note, it shall immediately advise
Administrative Agent and the Funds Administrator of such transfer, and
Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall be entitled conclusively to assume
that no transfer of any Note has been made by any holder (including any Lender)
unless and until Administrative Agent and the Funds Administrator shall have
received written notice to the contrary. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by all of the other
parties hereto, no Lender shall, by reason of the transfer of a Note or
otherwise, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder. Each transferee of
any Note shall take such Note subject to the provisions of this Agreement and to
any request made, waiver or consent given or other action taken hereunder, prior
to the receipt by Administrative Agent and the Funds Administrator of written
notice of such transfer, by each previous holder of such Note, and, except as
expressly otherwise provided in such transfer, Administrative Agent, any
Borrower and the Funds Administrator shall be entitled conclusively to assume
that the transferee named in such notice shall hereafter be vested with all
rights and powers under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Pro Rata
Share of the Loans of the Lender named as the payee of the Note which is the
subject of such transfer.

          13.14  REGISTRY. The Borrowers hereby designate Administrative Agent
to serve as the Borrowers' agent, solely for purposes of this SECTION 13.14 to
maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will record the Loans made by
each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the
Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such
recordation shall not affect any Borrower's obligations in respect of such
Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the rights to the principal
of, and interest on, any Loan shall not be effective until such transfer is
recorded on the Register maintained by Administrative Agent with respect to
ownership of such Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the
transferor with respect to such Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The
registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Loans shall be
recorded by Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by
Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and
Assumption Agreement pursuant to SECTION 13.9(c). Coincident with the delivery
of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to Administrative Agent for
acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan,
or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall
surrender the Note (if any) evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new
Notes in the same aggregate principal amount then owing to such assignor or
transferor Lender shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or
the new Lender. The Borrowers agree to indemnify Administrative Agent from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature
which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by Administrative Agent
(other than those arising from the gross negligence or willful negligence of the
Administrative Agent) in performing its duties under this SECTION 13.14.

          13.15  HEADINGS. The Table of Contents and Article and Section
headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall
not affect the construction of this Agreement.

          13.16  TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall terminate when
the Revolving Commitment of each Lender has terminated and all outstanding
Obligations and

                                       135
<Page>

Loans have been paid in full and all Letters of Credit have expired or been
terminated or otherwise handled in a manner satisfactory to the issuer thereof;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the rights and remedies of Collateral Agent,
Administrative Agent and each Lender with respect to any representation and
warranty made by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and the indemnification provisions contained in this Agreement and any
other Loan Document, including, without limitation, SECTIONS 3.4, 3.5, and 4.8,
shall be continuing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document. The Mortgaged Property, the Collateral and any other
collateral security for the Obligations shall be released from any security
interest or Lien created by the Loan Documents in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Security Documents.

          13.17  CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Lenders severally agrees to keep
confidential all non-public information pertaining to any Borrower and any
Subsidiaries or Affiliates which is provided to it by any such parties in
accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential
information of this nature and in a prudent fashion, and shall not disclose such
information to any Person except:

          (a)    to the extent such information is public when received by such
Lender or becomes public thereafter due to the act or omission of any party
other than a Lender,

          (b)    to the extent such information is independently obtained from a
source other than a Borrower or its Subsidiaries and such information from such
source is not, to such Lender's knowledge, subject to an obligation of
confidentiality or, if such information is subject to an obligation of
confidentiality, that disclosure of such information is permitted,

          (c)    to an Affiliate of such Lender, counsel, auditors, examiners of
any regulatory authority having or reasonably asserting jurisdiction over such
Lender, accountants and other consultants retained by Administrative Agent or
any Lender or to any Affiliate of a Lender which is a direct or indirect
contractual counterparty in swap agreements with any Borrower or a Subsidiary of
any Borrower or such contractual counterparty's professional advisor (so long as
such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual
counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this SECTION 13.17) or to
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization
or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information
about a Lender's investment portfolio in connection with rating issued with
respect to such Lender,

          (d)    in connection with any litigation or the enforcement of the
rights of any Lender or Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document,

          (e)    to the extent (x) required by any applicable statute, rule or
regulation or court order (including, without limitation, by way of subpoena) or
pursuant to the request of any Governmental Authority having or reasonably
asserting jurisdiction over any Lender or Administrative Agent; provided,
however, that in such event, if the Lender(s) are able to do so, the Lender
shall provide the Funds Administrator with prompt notice of such requested
disclosure so that the Borrowers may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, and, in any event, the Lenders will endeavor in good faith
to provide only that portion of such

                                       136
<Page>

information which, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender(s), is relevant and
legally required to be provided, (y) requested by any nationally recognized
rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender's investment
portfolio in connection with rating issued with respect to such Lender or (z)
requested by an Affiliate of a Lender which is a direct or indirect contractual
counterparty in swap agreements with a Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower
or such contractual counterparty's professional advisor (so long as such
contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual
counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this SECTION 13.17) or to
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization
or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information
about a Lender's investment portfolio in connection with rating issued with
respect to such Lender,

          (f)    to the extent disclosure to other entities is appropriate in
connection with any proposed or actual assignment or grant of a participation by
any of the Lenders of interests in this Agreement and/or any of the other Loan
Documents to such other entities (who will in turn be required to maintain
confidentiality as if they were Lenders parties to this Agreement). In no event
shall Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated or required to return any
such information or other materials furnished by the Borrowers.

          13.18  CONCERNING THE COLLATERAL AND THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

          (a)    AUTHORITY. Each Lender and each Facing Bank authorizes and
directs Administrative Agent to act as Collateral Agent and to enter into the
Loan Documents relating to the Collateral for the benefit of the Lenders and the
Facing Banks and the other Secured Parties. Each Lender and each Facing Bank
agree that any action taken by Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the
Required Lenders (or, where required by the express terms hereof, a different
proportion of the Lenders) in accordance with the provisions hereof or of the
other Loan Documents, and the exercise by Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or the Required Lenders (or, where so required, such different proportion
of the Lenders) of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and
binding upon all of the Lenders and Facing Banks. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent as the
case may be, shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to (i) act as
the disbursing and collecting agent for the Lenders and the Facing Banks with
respect to all payments and collections arising in connection herewith and with
the Loan Documents relating to the Collateral; (ii) execute and deliver each
Loan Document relating to the Collateral and accept delivery of each such
agreement delivered by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) act as
Collateral Agent for the Lenders and the Facing Banks for purposes of the
perfection of security interests and Liens created by such agreements and all
other purposes stated therein to the extent such perfection is required under
the Loan Documents, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Collateral Agent hereby appoints,
authorizes and directs each Lender and each Facing Bank to act as collateral
sub-agent for Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Facing Banks for
purposes of the perfection of all security interests and Liens with respect to a
Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' respective deposit accounts maintained with,
and cash and Cash Equivalents held by, such Lender or such Facing Bank; (iv)
manage, supervise and otherwise deal with the Collateral; (v) take such action
as is necessary or desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the
security interests and liens created or purported to be created by the Loan
Documents; and (vi) except as may be otherwise

                                       137
<Page>

specifically restricted by the terms hereof or of any other Loan Document,
exercise all remedies given to Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Facing
Banks with respect to the Collateral under the Loan Documents relating thereto,
applicable law or otherwise.

          (b)    RELEASE OF COLLATERAL. (i) Each of the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the Facing Banks hereby direct the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent, as the case may be, to release, in accordance with the terms
hereof, any Lien held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
the case may be, under the Security Documents (and, in the case of clause (B)
below, release the affected Subsidiary from its guaranty),

          (A)    against all of the Collateral, upon final and indefeasible
     payment in full in cash of the Loans and Obligations and termination
     hereof;

          (B)    against any part of the Collateral sold or disposed of by any
     Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than sales permitted
     under SECTION 8.6(e) but including, without limitation, in the case of a
     sale or disposition of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary owned by a
     Borrower and its Subsidiaries, all assets of such Subsidiary and its
     Subsidiaries and all Pledged Intercompany Notes issued by such Subsidiary
     and its Subsidiaries), if such sale or disposition is permitted hereby (or
     permitted pursuant to a waiver or consent of a transaction otherwise
     prohibited by such Section);

          (C)    against any Collateral acquired by any Borrower or any of its
     Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and at least 80% of the purchase price
     therefor is within 120 days of the acquisition thereof financed with
     Indebtedness secured by a Lien permitted by SECTION 8.1(b)(i); and

          (D)    against a part of the Collateral which release does not require
     the consent of all of the Lenders as set forth in SECTION 13.1(a)(D), if
     such release is consented to by the Required Lenders;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
the case may be, shall not be required to execute any such document on terms
which, in its opinion, would expose it to liability or create any obligation or
entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or
warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or
impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of any Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries in respect of) all interests retained by any Borrower and/or
any of its Subsidiaries, including (without limitation) the proceeds of any
sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

          (ii)   Each of the Lenders and the Facing Banks hereby direct the
Collateral Agent to execute and deliver or file such termination and partial
release statements and do such other things as are necessary to release Liens to
be released pursuant to this SECTION 13.18 promptly upon the effectiveness of
any such release or enter into intercreditor agreements contemplated or
permitted herein.

                                       138
<Page>

          (c)    NO OBLIGATION. Neither Administrative Agent nor the Collateral
Agent shall have any obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person
to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or
that the Liens granted to Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent herein or
pursuant to the Loan Documents have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully
created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular
priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of
care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights,
authorities and powers granted or available to Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed
that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related
thereto, Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may act in any manner it
may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, given Administrative Agent's own
interests in the Collateral as one of the Lenders and that neither
Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty or liability
whatsoever to any Lender; PROVIDED, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Administrative Agent shall be responsible for their grossly negligent actions or
actions constituting intentional misconduct.

          (d)    SENIOR LIENS. Each Lender hereby instructs the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement and such amendments or modifications thereto and to the
other Security Documents consistent herewith as the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent reasonably determines to be necessary to cause the Liens
granted by the Borrowers and the Restricted Subsidiaries in favor of the
Administrative Agent and Lenders to secure the Obligations to be senior to the
Liens granted to secure the Term Loan Obligations. Each Lender agrees that it
shall be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

          13.19  JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF BORROWERS.

          (a)    Each of the Borrowers shall be jointly and severally liable
hereunder and under each of the other Loan Documents with respect to all
Obligations, regardless of which of the Borrowers actually receives the proceeds
of the Loans or the benefit of any other extensions of credit hereunder, or the
manner in which the Funds Administrator, the Borrowers, the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders or any of the Facing Banks account therefore in their
respective books and records. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, (i) each Borrower's obligations and liabilities with respect to
proceeds of Loans which it receives or Letters of Credit issued for its account,
and related fees, costs and expenses, and (ii) each Borrower's obligations and
liabilities arising as a result of the joint and several liability of the
Borrowers hereunder with respect to proceeds of Loans received by, or Letters of
Credit issued for the account of, any of the other Borrowers, together with the
related fees, costs and expenses, shall be separate and distinct obligations,
both of which are primary obligations of such Borrower. Neither the joint and
several liability of, nor the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent under the
Security Documents by, any of the Borrowers shall be impaired or released by (A)
the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Facing Bank, any
successors or assigns thereof, or any holder of any Note or any of the
Obligations to assert any claim or demand or to exercise or enforce any right,
power or remedy against the Funds Administrator, any Borrower, any Subsidiary of
any Borrower, any other Person, the Collateral or otherwise; (B) any extension

                                       139
<Page>

or renewal for any period (whether or not longer than the original period) or
exchange of any of the Obligations or the release or compromise of any
obligation of any nature of any Person with respect thereto; (C) the surrender,
release or exchange of all or any part of any property (including without
limitation the Collateral) securing payment, performance and/or observance of
any of the Obligations or the compromise or extension or renewal for any period
(whether or not longer than the original period) of any obligations of any
nature of any Person with respect to any such property; (D) any action or
inaction on the part of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Facing Bank,
or any other event or condition with respect to any other Borrower, including
any such action or inaction or other event or condition, which might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower, or a
guarantor or surety of or for any or all of the Obligations; and (E) any other
act, matter or thing (other than payment or performance of the Obligations)
which would or might, in the absence of this provision, operate to release,
discharge or otherwise prejudicially affect the obligations of such Borrower or
any other Borrower.

          (b)    Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein
or in any other of the Loan Documents, to the extent the joint obligations of a
Borrower shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason
(including, without limitation, because of Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act,
Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law) then the
Obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount
that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and
including, without limitation, the federal Bankruptcy Code).

          (c)    To the extent that any Borrower shall make a payment under this
SECTION 13.19(c) of all or any of the Obligations (other than Loans made to that
Borrower for which it is primarily liable) (a "GUARANTOR PAYMENT") that, taking
into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made
by any other Borrower, exceeds the amount that such Borrower would otherwise
have paid if each Borrower had paid the aggregate Obligations satisfied by such
Guarantor Payment in the same proportion that such Borrower's "Allocable Amount"
(as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment)
bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Borrowers as determined
immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations and termination of the
Commitments, such Borrower shall be entitled to receive contribution and
indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Borrower for the
amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in
effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment. As of any date of
determination, the "Allocable Amount" of any Borrower shall be equal to the
maximum amount of the claim that could then be recovered from such Borrower
under this SECTION 13.19(c) without rendering such claim voidable or avoidable
under Section 548 of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable
state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or
similar statute or common law. This SECTION 13.19(c) is intended only to define
the relative rights of the Borrowers and nothing set forth in this SECTION
13.19(c) is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Borrowers,
jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due
and payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including SECTION
13.19(a). Nothing contained in this SECTION 13.19(c) shall

                                       140
<Page>

limit the liability of any Borrower to pay the Loans made directly or indirectly
to that Borrower and accrued interest, fees and expenses with respect thereto
for which such Borrower shall be primarily liable. The parties hereto
acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall
constitute assets of the Borrower to which such contribution and indemnification
is owing. The rights of each Borrower against each other Borrower under this
SECTION 13.19(c) shall not be exercisable until the full and indefeasible
payment of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments.

          (d)    The liability of the Borrowers under this SECTION 13.19 is in
addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Borrower to
Administrative Agent and Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to which such Borrower is a party, without any limitation as to
amount.

          13.20  APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF FUNDS ADMINISTRATOR.

          (a)    Each Borrower hereby designates, appoints, authorizes and
empowers the Company as its agent to act as specified in the capacity of Funds
Administrator under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents and the
Company hereby acknowledges such designation, authorization and empowerment, and
accepts such appointment. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and
directs the Funds Administrator to take such action on its behalf under the
respective provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any
other instruments, documents and agreements referred to herein or therein, and
to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as
are specifically delegated to or required of the Funds Administrator by the
respective terms and provisions hereof and thereof, and such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, including, without limitation, to take the
following actions for and on such Borrower's behalf:

                 (i)    to submit on behalf of each Borrower Notices of
     Borrowing, Notices of Conversion and Notices of Continuation to
     Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,
     each such notice to be submitted by the Funds Administrator to
     Administrative Agent as soon as practicable after its receipt of a request
     to do so from a Borrower; and

                 (ii)   to submit on behalf of each Borrower requests for the
     issuance of Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this
     Agreement, each such request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit to be
     submitted by the Funds Administrator as soon as practicable after its
     receipt of a request to do so from any Borrower.

     The Funds Administrator is further authorized and directed by each of the
     Borrowers to take all such actions on behalf of such Borrower necessary to
     exercise the specific powers granted in clauses (i) and (ii) above and to
     perform such other duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and
     deliver such documents as delegated to or required of the Funds
     Administrator by the terms hereof or thereof. Administrative Agent and each
     Lender may regard any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan
     Documents from the Funds Administrator as a notice or communication from
     all Borrowers, and may give any notice or communication required or
     permitted to be given to any Borrower or

                                       141
<Page>

     Borrowers hereunder to the Funds Administrator on behalf of such Borrower
     or Borrowers. Each Borrower agrees that each notice, election,
     representation and warranty, covenant, agreement and undertaking made on
     its behalf by the Funds Administrator shall be deemed for all purposes to
     have been made by such Borrower and shall be binding upon and enforceable
     against such Borrower to the same extent as if the same had been made
     directly by such Borrower.

          (b)    The Funds Administrator may perform any of its duties hereunder
or under any of the other Loan Documents by or through its agents or employees.
