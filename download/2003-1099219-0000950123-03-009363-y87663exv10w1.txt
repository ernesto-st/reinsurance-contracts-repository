                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE CREDITS

         Section 2.1       Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each Lender severally and not jointly agrees to make Revolving
Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the Availability Period in an
aggregate principal amount that will not result in (a) such Lender's Revolving
Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender's Commitment or (b) the sum of the total
Revolving Credit Exposures of all Lenders plus the aggregate principal amount of
all outstanding Competitive Loans exceeding the Aggregate Commitment. Within the
foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, any
Borrower or all Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. The
Commitments to lend hereunder shall expire on the Termination Date.

         Section 2.2       Loans and Borrowings.

                  (a)      Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a
         Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders ratably in
         accordance with their respective Commitments. Each Competitive Loan
         shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
         2.4. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by
         it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
         provided that the Commitments and Competitive Bids of the Lenders are
         several and not joint, and no Lender shall be responsible for any other
         Lender's failure to make Loans as required. The obligations of the
         Borrowers to repay Loans shall be several, not joint.

                                      -15-

                  (b)      Subject to Section 2.12, (i) each Revolving Borrowing
         shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the
         Requesting Borrower may request in accordance herewith, and (ii) each
         Competitive Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of Eurodollar Loans
         or Fixed Rate Loans as the Requesting Borrower may request in
         accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar
         Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
         Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option
         shall not affect the obligation of the Requesting Borrower to repay
         such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (c)      At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
         Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
         amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
         $10,000,000. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made,
         such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
         multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000; provided, that an
         ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to
         the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. Each Competitive
         Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple
         of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. Borrowings of more than
         one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that
         there shall not at any time be more than a total of ten (10) Eurodollar
         Revolving Borrowings outstanding.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
         Agreement, the Borrowers shall not be entitled to request, or to elect
         to convert or continue, any Revolving Borrowing if the Interest Period
         requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.

         Section 2.3       Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a
Revolving Borrowing, the Requesting Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
not later than 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of
the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than
10:00 a.m., Chicago time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed
Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent
of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
and signed by the Requesting Borrower. Each such telephonic and written
Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.2:

                           (i)      the name of the Requesting Borrower and
                  aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

                           (ii)     the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
                  Business Day;

                           (iii)    whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR
                  Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;

                           (iv)     in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
                  initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto (which may
                  not end after the Maturity Date); and

                           (v)      the location and number of the Requesting
                  Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which
                  shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.5.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then
the Requesting Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of
one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in
accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender
of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as
part of the requested Borrowing.

         Section 2.4       Competitive Bid Procedure.

                  (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
         from time to time during the Availability Period any Borrower or all
         Borrowers may request Competitive Bids and may (but shall not have any
         obligation to) accept Competitive Bids and borrow Competitive Loans;
         provided that the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures of all
         Lenders plus the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
         Competitive Loans at any time shall not exceed the Aggregate
         Commitment. To request Competitive Bids, the Requesting Borrower shall
         notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone, in the
         case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., Chicago
         time, four Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing and,
         in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 9:00 a.m.,
         Chicago time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed
         Borrowing; provided that the Borrowers may submit up to (but not more
         than) three Competitive Bid Requests on the same day, but a Competitive
         Bid Request shall not be made within five Business Days after the date
         of any previous Competitive Bid Request, unless any and all such
         previous Competitive Bid Requests shall have been withdrawn or all
         Competitive Bids received in response thereto rejected. Each such
         telephonic Competitive Bid Request shall be confirmed promptly by hand
         delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
         Competitive Bid Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
         and signed by the Requesting Borrower. Each such telephonic and written
         Competitive Bid Request shall specify the following information in
         compliance with Section 2.2:

                           (i)      the name of the Borrower and aggregate
                  amount of the requested Borrowing;

                           (ii)     the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
                  Business Day;

                           (iii)    whether such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar
                  Borrowing or a Fixed Rate Borrowing;

                           (iv)     the Interest Period to be applicable to such
                  Borrowing (which may not end after the Termination Date); and

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

                           (v)      the location and number of the Requesting
                  Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which
                  shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.5.

                  Promptly following receipt of a Competitive Bid Request in
         accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
         Lenders of the details thereof by telecopy, inviting the Lenders to
         submit Competitive Bids.

                  (b)      Each Lender may (but shall not have any obligation
         to) make one or more Competitive Bids to the Requesting Borrower in
         response to a Competitive Bid Request. Each Competitive Bid by a Lender
         must be in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and must be
         received by the Administrative Agent by telecopy, in the case of a
         Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 9:00 a.m., Chicago
         time, three Business Days before the proposed date of such Competitive
         Borrowing, and in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than
         9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the proposed date of such Competitive
         Borrowing. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the
         form approved by the Administrative Agent may be rejected by the
         Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the
         applicable Lender as promptly as practicable. Each Competitive Bid
         shall specify (i) the principal amount (which shall be a minimum of
         $10,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal
         the entire principal amount of the Competitive Borrowing requested by
         the Requesting Borrower) of the Competitive Loan or Loans that the
         Lender is willing to make, (ii) the Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at
         which the Lender is prepared to make such Loan or Loans, and (iii) the
         Interest Period applicable to each such Loan and the last day thereof.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
         Requesting Borrower by telecopy of the Competitive Bid Rate and the
         principal amount specified in each Competitive Bid and the identity of
         the Lender that shall have made such Competitive Bid.

                  (d)      Subject only to the provisions of this paragraph, the
         Requesting Borrower may accept or reject any Competitive Bid. Such
         Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone, confirmed
         by telecopy in a form approved by the Administrative Agent, whether and
         to what extent it has decided to accept or reject each Competitive Bid,
         in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 10:00
         a.m., Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed
         Competitive Borrowing, and in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not
         later than 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the proposed date of the
         Competitive Borrowing; provided that (i) the failure of such Borrower
         to give such notice shall be deemed to be a rejection of each
         Competitive Bid, (ii) such Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Bid
         made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if such Borrower rejects a
         Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (iii) the
         aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by such Borrower
         shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the requested Competitive
         Borrowing specified in the related Competitive Bid Request, (iv) to the
         extent necessary to comply with clause (iii) above, such Borrower may
         accept Competitive Bids at the same Competitive Bid Rate in part, which
         acceptance, in the case of multiple Competitive Bids at such
         Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made by such Borrower in

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

         consultation with the Administrative Agent pro rata in accordance with
         the amount of each such Competitive Bid, and (v) except pursuant to
         clause (iv) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a
         Competitive Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal
         amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000; and
         provided further that if a Competitive Loan must be in an amount less
         than $5,000,000 because of the provisions of clause (iv) above, such
         Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of $1,000,000 or any integral
         multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation of
         acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a particular
         Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts shall be
         rounded to integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner determined by
         the Requesting Borrower in consultation with the Administrative Agent.
         A notice given by the Requesting Borrower pursuant to this paragraph
         shall be irrevocable.

                  (e)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
         bidding Lender by telecopy whether or not its Competitive Bid has been
         accepted (and, if so, the amount and Competitive Bid Rate so accepted),
         and each successful bidder will thereupon become bound, subject to the
         terms and conditions hereof, to make the Competitive Loan in respect of
         which its Competitive Bid has been accepted.

                  (f)      If the Administrative Agent shall elect to submit a
         Competitive Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such
         Competitive Bid directly to the Requesting Borrower at least one
         quarter of an hour earlier than the time by which the other Lenders are
         required to submit their Competitive Bids to the Administrative Agent
         pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.

         Section 2.5       Funding of Borrowings.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it
         hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately
         available funds by 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, to the account of the
         Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
         notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
         available to the Requesting Borrower by transferring the amounts so
         received on the proposed date of the Borrowing, in immediately
         available funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the
         Administrative Agent in Chicago or as designated by such Borrower in
         the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request.

                  (b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
         notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that
         such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
         Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume
         that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
         accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon
         such assumption, make available to the Requesting Borrower a
         corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made
         its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative
         Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Requesting Borrower severally
         agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
         corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
         including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to
         but excluding the date of payment to the

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

         Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal
         Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
         thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (ii)
         in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the
         relevant Loan. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
         Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in
         such Borrowing.

         Section 2.6       Interest Elections.

                  (a)      Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the
         Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of
         a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period
         as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Requesting
         Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to
         continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving
         Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this
         Section. The Requesting Borrower may elect different options with
         respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case
         each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding
         the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
         portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall
         not apply to Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or
         continued.

                  (b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section, the
         Requesting Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
         election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be
         required under Section 2.3 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving
         Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the
         effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
         Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
         delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
         Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and
         signed by the Requesting Borrower.

                  (c)      Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
         shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.2:

                           (i)      the name of the Borrower and Borrowing to
                  which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different
                  options are being elected with respect to different portions
                  thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
                  resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
                  specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be
                  specified for each resulting Borrowing);

                           (ii)     the effective date of the election made
                  pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a
                  Business Day;

                           (iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an
                  ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                           (iv)     if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar
                  Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
                  giving effect to such election (which may not end after the
                  Maturity Date).

         If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing
         but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Requesting Borrower
         shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
         duration.

                  (d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
         Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
         details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting
         Borrowing.

                  (e)      If the Requesting Borrower fails to deliver a timely
         Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving
         Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
         then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of
         such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
         Revolving Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
         an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
         Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so
         notifies the Requesting Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default
         is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted
         to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
         Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
         at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

         Section 2.7       Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

                  (a)      Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall
         terminate on the Termination Date.

                  (b)      Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
         Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Required Lenders, by
         notice to the Borrowers, terminate the Commitments and thereupon the
         Commitments shall terminate immediately.

                  (c)      The Borrowers may at any time terminate, or from time
         to time reduce, the Aggregate Commitment; provided that (i) each
         reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall be in an amount that is an
         integral multiple of $10,000,000 and (ii) the Borrowers shall not
         terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitment if, after giving effect to
         any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.9,
         the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures of all Lenders plus the
         aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Competitive Loans would
         exceed the Aggregate Commitment.

                  (d)      The Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent
         of any election to terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitment under
         paragraph (c) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the
         effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such
         election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of
         any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
         contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrowers pursuant to
         this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of
         termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitment delivered by the
         Borrowers may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
         effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may
         be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on
         or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

         satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitment
         shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall be
         made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
         Commitments. All accrued Facility Fees and Utilization Fees shall be
         payable on the effective date of the termination of the obligations of
         the Lenders to make Loans hereunder.

         Section 2.8       Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

                  (a)      Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay
         (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then
         unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to such Borrower
         hereunder on the Termination Date, and (ii) to the Administrative Agent
         for account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
         Competitive Loan made to such Borrower on the last day of the Interest
         Period applicable to such Loan; provided, that upon the written request
         of the Borrowers delivered to the Administrative Agent at least ten
         (10) Business Days prior to the Termination Date and so long as no
         Default has occurred and is continuing on the Termination Date, the
         Revolving Loan Termination Balance shall be converted to a term loan
         which shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

                  (b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
         usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of
         each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
         Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and
         paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in
         which it shall record (i) the name of the Borrower and amount of each
         Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period
         applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due
         and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each
         Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
         Administrative Agent from any Borrower hereunder for the account of the
         Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant
         to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence
         of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
         provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to
         maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner
         affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay its Loans in accordance
         with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (e)      Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be
         evidenced by promissory notes substantially in the form of Exhibit C
         (each, a "Note"). In such event, each Borrower shall prepare, execute
         and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or, if
         requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns)
         and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
         Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times
         (including after assignment pursuant to Article IX) be represented by
         one or more Notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or
         to its registered assigns).

         Section 2.9       Prepayment of Loans.

                  (a)      Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and
         from time to time to prepay without penalty (except as may be provided
         in Section 2.14) any Borrowing of such Borrower in whole or in part,
         subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this
         Section; provided that no Borrower shall have the right to prepay any
         Competitive Loan without the prior consent of the Lender thereof.

                  (b)      The Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent
         by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in
         the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later
         than 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of
         prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving
         Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, one Business Day
         before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable
         and shall specify the name of the Borrower, the prepayment date and the
         principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
         provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a
         conditional notice of termination of the Aggregate Commitment as
         contemplated by Section 2.7, then such notice of prepayment may be
         revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with
         Section 2.7. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to
         a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
         Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any
         Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in
         the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as
         provided in Section 2.2. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall
         be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
         Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent
         required by Section 2.11.

                  (c)      Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, each
         Borrower agrees that if requested by the Administrative Agent (acting
         at the request of the Required Lenders) such Borrower will promptly
         prepay each Loan, together with accrued interest.

         Section 2.10      Fees.

                  (a)      Facility Fee. The Borrowers jointly and severally
         agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender
         a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") as follows: (i) from the Effective
         Date to but not including the Termination Date, the Borrowers agree to
         pay a Facility Fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Facility
         Fee Rate on each Lender's Commitment, regardless of usage; and (ii)
         from and after the Termination Date, the Borrowers agree to pay a
         Facility Fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Facility Fee
         Rate on each Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure. The Facility Fee shall
         be based on the Level Status (as defined in the Pricing Schedule) of
         the Borrower which has the lowest Level Status of all Borrowers. The
         Facility Fee is payable quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date
         hereafter, on the Termination Date and on the Maturity Date.

                  (b)      Utilization Fee. The Borrowers agree to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a utilization fee
         (the "Utilization Fee") as follows: (i) for

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

         each day from the Effective Date to but not including the Termination
         Date on which the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Loans
         (including both Revolving Loans and Competitive Loans) to all Borrowers
         exceeds 50% of the Aggregate Commitment, each Borrower agrees to pay a
         Utilization Fee based on each Lender's outstanding Loans at a per annum
         rate equal to the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate on the average daily
         amount of all outstanding Loans to such Borrower and (ii) on and after
         the Termination Date, each Borrower agrees to pay a Utilization Fee
         based on each Lender's outstanding Loans at a rate per annum equal to
         the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate on the average daily amount of all
         outstanding Loans to such Borrower. The Utilization Fee is payable
         quarterly in arrears on each Payment Date hereafter, on the Termination
         Date and on the Maturity Date.

                  (c)      Competitive Bid Fee. Each Borrower agrees to pay to
         the Administrative Agent for its own account a fee for each Competitive
         Bid Request submitted by such Borrower under Section 2.4 in an amount
         agreed to in the fee letter dated March 31, 2003 (the "Fee Letter").

                  (d)      Payment of Fees. All fees payable hereunder shall be
         paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the
         Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of the Utilization
         Fee and the Facility Fee, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be
         refundable under any circumstances.

         Section 2.11      Interest.

                  (a)      The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear
         interest at the Alternate Base Rate. Changes in the rate of interest on
         any ABR Borrowing will take effect simultaneously with each change in
         the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (b)      The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall
         bear interest at (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Loan, the
         Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing,
         or (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Eurodollar
         Bid Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing.

                  (c)      Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at the Fixed
         Rate applicable to such Loan.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
         interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower
         hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon
         acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,
         after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in
         the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise
         applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this
         Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
         applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

                  (e)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in
         arrears on each Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of
         Revolving Loans, upon termination of the

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

         Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph
         (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of
         any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an
         ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period),
         accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
         payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
         event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the
         end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
         Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

                  (f)      All interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on
         the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by
         reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base
         Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a
         year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall
         be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
         day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate,
         Eurodollar Rate, Eurodollar Bid Rate or Eurodollar Base Rate shall be
         determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be
         conclusive absent manifest error.

         Section 2.12      Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a)      the Administrative Agent determines (which
         determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate
         and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate,
         the Eurodollar Base Rate or the Eurodollar Bid Rate, as applicable, for
         such Interest Period; or

                  (b)      the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
         Lenders (or, in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Lender
         that is required to make such Loan) that the Eurodollar Rate, the
         Eurodollar Base Rate or the Eurodollar Bid Rate, as applicable, for
         such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
         such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its
         Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the relevant Borrower and the Lenders
that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any
Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving
Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a
Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing
and (iii) any request by the relevant Borrower for a Eurodollar Competitive
Borrowing shall be ineffective; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving
rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by such
Borrower for Eurodollar Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are
not affected thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice
affect only one Type of Borrowing, then the other Type of Borrowing shall be
permitted.

         Section 2.13      Increased Costs.

                  (a)      If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
                  of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
                  by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected
                  in the Eurodollar Rate); or

                           (ii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank
                  market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
                  Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender;

         and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
         such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate
         Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to
         reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
         hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
         relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or
         amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs
         incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b)      If any Lender determines that any Change in Law
         regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing
         the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such
         Lender's holding company as a consequence of this Agreement or the
         Loans made to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's
         holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
         into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such
         Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from
         time to time each Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional
         amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's
         holding company, as the case may be, for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c)      A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or
         amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as
         the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section
         shall be delivered to the relevant Borrower(s) and shall be conclusive
         absent manifest error. Such Borrower(s) shall pay such Lender the
         amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after
         receipt thereof.

                  (d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
         compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
         such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that no
         Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
         Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90
         days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the relevant
         Borrower(s) of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
         reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation
         therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to
         such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day
         period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
         retroactive effect thereof.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
         Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to
         this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law
         that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall

                                      -26-

         have been publicly announced prior to submission of the Competitive Bid
         pursuant to which such Loan was made.

         Section 2.14      Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including, without
limitation, as a result of a mandatory prepayment under Section 2.9(c) or an
Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow,
convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be
revoked under Section 2.9(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the
failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to
make such Loan, or (e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by any Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event,
the relevant Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and
expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss,
cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by
such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would
have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred,
at the Eurodollar Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the
period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest
Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue,
for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over
(ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such
period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and
period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender
setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the relevant Borrower and shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Borrower shall pay such Lender the
amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt
thereof.

         Section 2.15      Taxes.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by or on account of any
         obligation of each Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of
         and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
         provided that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum
         payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
         required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
         payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the
         case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
         had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such
         deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
         to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
         law.

                  (b)      In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes
         not paid pursuant to Section 2.15(a)(iii) to the relevant Governmental
         Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                                      -27-

                  (c)      Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative
         Agent and each Lender within thirty (30) days after written demand
         therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
         paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on
         or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of
         such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
         imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
         Section) and any penalties, interest, additions to tax and reasonable
         expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
         asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided, that such
         Borrower shall not be obligated to make a payment pursuant to this
         Section 2.15 in respect of penalties, interest and additions to tax
         attributable to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, if (i) such
         penalties, interest and additions to tax are attributable to the
         failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
         to pay amounts paid to the Administrative Agent or such Lender by such
         Borrower (for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes) to the relevant
         Governmental Authority within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
         payment from such Borrower or (ii) such penalties, interest and
         additions to tax are attributable to the gross negligence or willful
         misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
         be. Within 180 days after the Administrative Agent or such Lender
         learns of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, such
         Person shall give notice to the relevant Borrower of the payment by the
         Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of such
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, and of the assertion by any
         Governmental Authority that such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are
         due and payable, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect
         such Borrower's obligations hereunder to reimburse the Administrative
         Agent and such Lender for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, except
         that such Borrower shall not be liable for penalties, interest and
         other liabilities accrued or incurred after such 180 day period until
         such time as it receives the notice contemplated above, after which
         time it shall be liable for penalties, interest and other liabilities
         accrued or incurred prior to or during such 180 day period and accrued
         or incurred after such receipt. Such Borrower shall not be liable for
         any penalties, interest and other liabilities with respect to such
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent it has reimbursed the
         amount thereof to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case
         may be. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
         delivered to the relevant Borrower by a Lender, or by the
         Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall
         be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the relevant Borrower to a
         Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the
         Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
         issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy
         of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
         reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e)      Each Foreign Lender, before it signs and delivers
         this Agreement if listed on the signature pages hereof, and before it
         becomes a Lender in the case of each other Foreign Lender, shall
         provide such Borrower and the Administrative Agent either (i) two
         accurate, complete and signed copies of either (x) U.S. Internal
         Revenue Service Form

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

         W-8ECI or any successor form, or (y) U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form
         W-8BEN or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, or any successor
         form, in each case, indicating that such Lender is on the date of
         delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of interest hereunder
         free from, or subject to a reduced rate of withholding of United States
         Federal income tax or (ii) in the case of such a Lender that is
         entitled to claim exemption from withholding of United States Federal
         income tax under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code with
         respect to payments of "portfolio interest", (x) a certificate to the
         effect that such Lender is (A) not a "bank" within the meaning of
         Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) not a "10 percent shareholder" of
         any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code and
         (C) not a controlled foreign corporation related to any Borrower within
         the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) two accurate,
         complete and signed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
         or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-81MY, or any successor Form. To
         the extent permitted by applicable law, from time to time thereafter,
         at the request of any Borrower, each Foreign Lender shall deliver
         renewals or additional copies of such forms (or successor forms) on or
         before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete. Upon the
         written request of a Borrower to the Administrative Agent and any
         Lender which is not a Foreign Lender, such Lender shall provide such
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent with two accurate, complete and
         signed copies of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9.

                  (f)      If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other
         Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent
         did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account
         of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or
         properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify the
         Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its
         exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such
         Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts
         paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax,
         withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
         and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to
         the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (f), together with all
         costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time
         charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may
         be employees of the Administrative Agent). The obligations of the
         Lenders under this paragraph (f) shall survive the payment of the Loans
         and termination of this Agreement.

                  (g)      If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines,
         in its good faith judgment, that it has actually received or realized
         any refund of tax or any reduction of its tax liabilities or otherwise
         recovered any amount in connection with any deduction or withholding or
         payment of any additional amount by any Borrower pursuant to Section
         2.13(a) or this Section 2.15, such Person shall reimburse such Borrower
         in an amount equal to the net benefit, after tax, and net of all
         expenses incurred by such Person in connection with such refund,
         reduction or recovery; provided, that nothing in this paragraph (g)
         shall require any Person to make available its tax returns (or any
         other information relating to its taxes which it deems to be
         confidential). Each Borrower shall return such amount to the applicable
         Person in the event that such Person is required to repay such refund
         of tax or is not entitled to such reduction of, or credit against, its
         tax liabilities. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall become
         aware that it is

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

         entitled to receive a refund or direct credit in respect of Indemnified
         Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any
         Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional
         amounts, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of
         such refund or direct credit and shall, within 30 days after receipt of
         a request for such by such Borrower (whether as a result of
         notification that it has made of such to such Borrower or otherwise),
         make a claim to such Governmental Authority for such refund or direct
         credit and contest such Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes or liabilities
         if (i) such Borrower has agreed in writing to pay all of such Lender's
         or Administrative Agent's reasonable costs and expenses relating to
         such claim or contest, (ii) such Lender or the Administrative Agent
         determines, in its good faith judgment, that it would not be materially
         disadvantaged or prejudiced as a result of such claim or contest (it
         being understood that the mere existence of fees, charges, costs or
         expenses that such Borrower has offered to and agreed to pay on behalf
         of such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to be
         materially disadvantageous to such person) and (iii) such Borrower
         furnishes, upon request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, an
         opinion of reputable tax counsel (such opinion and such counsel to be
         acceptable to such Lender or the Administrative Agent) to the effect
         that such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were wrongly or illegally
         imposed.

         Section 2.16      Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs.

                  (a)      Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be
         made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of
         amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior
         to 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the date when due, in immediately
         available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received
         after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
         Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next
         succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.
         All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
         offices at 1 Bank One Plaza, Chicago, Illinois, 60670, except that
         payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 10.3 shall be made
         directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent
         shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of
         any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
         receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is
         not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
         succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
         interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such
         extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

                  (b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
         available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of
         principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
         applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
         hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance
         with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and
         (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably
         among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
         principal then due to such parties.

                  (c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
         set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
         principal of or interest on any of its

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

         Revolving Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater
         proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and accrued
         interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then
         the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash
         at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans of other Lenders
         to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall
         be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
         amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
         Revolving Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are
         purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
         recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase
         price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
         (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply
         to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with
         the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender
         as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in
         any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to MetLife
         or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of
         this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing
         and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable
         law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
         foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of
         set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as
         if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of
         such participation.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
         notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any
         payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
         Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the
         Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such
         payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon
         such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the amount due. In such
         event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of
         the Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
         forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with
         interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount
         is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
         Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective
         Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
         with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

                  (e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required
         to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.5(b) or 2.16(d), then the
         Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
         contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by
         the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such
         Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied
         obligations are fully paid.

         Section 2.17      Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

                  (a)      If any Lender requests compensation under Section
         2.13, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to
         any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
         pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall, upon the request of
         such Borrower, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
         office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
         rights and obligations

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

         hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the
         judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
         eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15,
         as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such
         Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
         disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
         reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with
         any such designation or assignment.

                  (b)      If any Lender (or, subject to Section 9.2.3, any
         Participant in Loans made by such Lender) requests compensation under
         Section 2.13, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional
         amount to any Lender (or, subject to Section 9.2.3, any Participant in
         Loans made by such Lender) or any Governmental Authority for account of
         any Lender (or any Participant in Loans made by such Lender) pursuant
         to Section 2.15, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund
         Loans hereunder, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort,
         upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
         Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and
         subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.3), all its
         interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any
         outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall
         assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
         Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall
         have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
         which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld and (ii) such Lender
         shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
         principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest
         thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
         from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
         accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Borrower (in the case of all
         other amounts). A Lender shall not be required to make any such
         assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
         such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to
         require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders, as to itself and

valid and binding obligation of each Borrower, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law. The Support Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and
Funding, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable

rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any Borrower.

         Section 3.4       Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.

                  (a)      MetLife has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
         audited consolidated balance sheet and statements of earnings, equity
         and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002,
         reported on by Deloitte & Touche, LLP, independent public accountants.
         Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
         financial position and results of operations and cash flows of MetLife
         and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, as of the date thereof and for such
         fiscal year, in accordance with GAAP.

                  (b)      The Company has heretofore furnished to each of the
         Lenders the annual Statutory Statement of the Company as at and for the
         year ended December 31, 2002, as filed with the Applicable Insurance
         Regulatory Authority. Such Statutory Statement presents fairly, in all

         with SAP.

                  (c)      Since December 31, 2002, there has been no material
         adverse change in the business, assets, property, condition (financial
         or otherwise) or prospects of MetLife and its Subsidiaries taken as a

         good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and
         personal property material to its business, except for defects in title
         that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
         expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

                  (b)      MetLife and each of its Material Subsidiaries owns,
         or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents
         and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use
         thereof by MetLife and its Material Subsidiaries does not infringe upon
         the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that,
         individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
         result in a Material Adverse Change.

         Section 3.6       Litigation and Environmental Matters.

                  (a)      There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or
         before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to
         the knowledge of any Borrower, threatened against or affecting MetLife
         or any of its Material Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a
         reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
         adversely determined, is reasonably likely, individually or in the
         aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Change (other than the
         Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the
         Transactions.

                  (b)      Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with
         respect to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
         could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Change, neither MetLife nor any of its Material Subsidiaries (i) has
         failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
         comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
         Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental
         Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any
         Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any
         Environmental Liability.

         Section 3.7       Compliance with Laws and Agreements. MetLife and each
of its Material Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. No Default has
occurred and is continuing.

         Section 3.8       Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither
MetLife nor any of its Material Subsidiaries (other than Funding) is an
"investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Investment Company Act of 1940, and Funding is an "investment company" as
defined in such Act that is exempt from the requirements of such Act. Neither
MetLife nor any of its Material Subsidiaries is a "holding company" as defined
in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935.

         Section 3.9       Taxes. MetLife and each of its Subsidiaries has
timely filed or caused to be filed all tax returns and reports required to have
been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been
paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which MetLife or such Subsidiary, as applicable,
has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the
failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Change.

         Section 3.10      ERISA. Each Plan and, to the knowledge of MetLife,
each Multiemployer Plan, is in compliance in all material respects with, and has
been administered in all material respects in compliance with, the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other Federal or State law, and no ERISA
Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together
with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to
occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         Section 3.11      Disclosure. None of the reports, financial
statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of any
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or
supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided that with respect to projected financial
information, each Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in
good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

         Section 3.12      Margin Stock. No part of the proceeds of any Loan
hereunder will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that
entails a violation of any of the Regulations of the Board, including
Regulations U and X. Not more than 25% of the value (as determined by any
reasonable method) of the assets of any of the Borrowers is represented by
Margin Stock.

amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b)
MetLife or such Material Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves

each of its Material Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations
and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property,

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         Section 5.8       Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans will be
used only for general corporate purposes (including the back-up of commercial
paper) of MetLife and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business;

or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the
Regulations of the Board, including Regulations U and X; provided further that
no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or
indirectly, to acquire the capital stock or business of any other Person without
the consent of such Person; and provided further that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall have any responsibility as to the use of any such

         of such Borrower;

                  (d)      Liens on any property or assets of any Person
         existing at the time such Person is merged or consolidated with or into

                  (e)      Liens on any real property securing Indebtedness in
         respect of which (i) the recourse of the holder of such Indebtedness
         (whether direct or indirect and whether contingent or otherwise) under

         creating the Lien or providing for the Indebtedness secured by the Lien
         collect by levy of execution or otherwise against assets or property of
         such Borrower (other than such real property directly securing such
         Indebtedness) if such Borrower fails to pay such Indebtedness when due

         recourse obligations that are customary in "non-recourse" real estate
         transactions;

         $2,000,000,000 at any one time outstanding;

                  (k)      Liens on debt obligations of such Borrower which are

         business and on ordinary business terms;

         assets would have been permitted in connection with the original
         creation, incurrence or assumption of such Lien.

         continue unremedied for a period of five or more Business Days;

                  (c)      any representation or warranty made or deemed made by

         Material Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or
         that enables or permits (with or without the giving of notice, the
         lapse of time or both) the holder or holders of any Material
         Indebtedness or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to cause

         the institution of, or fail to contest in a timely and appropriate
         manner, any proceeding or petition described in clause (h) of this

                  (k)      one or more judgments for the payment of money in an
         aggregate amount in excess of $200,000,000 (or its equivalent in any
         other currency) shall be rendered against MetLife, any Material
         Subsidiary of MetLife or any combination thereof and the same shall
         remain undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which
         execution shall not be effectively stayed; or

                  (l)      an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the
         opinion of the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other
         ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to result
         in liability of MetLife and its Material Subsidiaries in an aggregate
         amount exceeding $200,000,000 in any year;

Borrowers, declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or
in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may
thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of
the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest
thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder,
shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest
or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers;
and in case of any event with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or
(i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the
principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon
and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall
automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         Section 8.1       Appointment; Nature of Relationship. Bank One, NA is
hereby appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative
(herein referred to as the "Administrative Agent") hereunder and under each
other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act as the contractual representative of such Lender
with the rights and duties expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents. The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such contractual
representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article VIII.
Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Administrative Agent," it is
expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any
fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document and that the Administrative Agent is merely acting as the
contractual representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its
capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Administrative Agent
(a) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (b) is a
"representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of the term "secured party"
as defined in the New York Uniform Commercial Code and (c) is acting as an
independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the
Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any
agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all
of which claims each Lender hereby waives.

         Section 8.2       Powers. The Administrative Agent shall have and may
exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no
implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any
action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents
to be taken by the Administrative Agent.

         Section 8.3       General Immunity. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the
Borrowers, any Borrower, the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction
is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Person.

         Section 8.4       No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify
(a) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan
Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of
the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly
to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV,
except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Administrative
Agent; (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default; (e) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in
connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or
priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the financial condition
of any Borrower or any guarantor of any of the Loans or of any Borrower's or any
such guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall have no
duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished
by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent at such time, but is voluntarily
furnished by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent (either in its capacity as
Administrative Agent or in its individual capacity).

         Section 8.5       Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Administrative
Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written
instructions signed by the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the
Lenders. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be
under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless
it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all
liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action.

         Section 8.6       Employment of Administrative Agents and Counsel. The
Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative Agent
hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents, and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money
or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning the contractual arrangement between the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and all matters pertaining to the Administrative Agent's duties
hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

         Section 8.7       Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any note, notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document reasonably believed by
it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
Person or Persons, and, with respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of
counsel selected by the Administrative Agent, which counsel may be employees of
the Administrative Agent.

         Section 8.8       Administrative Agent's Reimbursement and
Indemnification. The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative
Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the
Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately
prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers
for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers
under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative
Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders) and (c) for any

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered
in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including,
without limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative
Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement
of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents,
provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the
extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent and (ii) any indemnification
required pursuant to Section 2.15(f) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 8.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the
provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 8.8 shall
survive payment of the Loans and all interest and fees with respect thereto and
termination of this Agreement.

         Section 8.9       Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not
be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default hereunder
unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or a
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lenders.

         Section 8.10      Rights as a Lender. In the event the Administrative
Agent is a Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and
powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document with respect to its
Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at
any time when the Administrative Agent is a Lender, unless the context otherwise
indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower in which such Borrower or
such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

         Section 8.11      Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Arranger or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by
MetLife and the Company and such other documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         Section 8.12      Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and
the Borrowers, such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a
successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. The Administrative
Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written notice
received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal to
be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Administrative Agent's giving
notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Administrative Agent may
appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Administrative
Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may at any time
without the consent of any Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates
which is a commercial bank as a successor Administrative Agent hereunder. No
successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until
such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such
successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and
retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or
removed Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation or
removal of the Administrative Agent, the resigning or removed Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of an
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall continue in
effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative
Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event that there is a
successor to the Administrative Agent by merger, or the Administrative Agent
assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section
8.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime
rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Administrative Agent.

         Section 8.13      Administrative Agent and Arranger Fees. The Borrowers
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, for their respective
accounts, the fees agreed to by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the
Arranger pursuant to the Fee Letter, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.

         Section 8.14      Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrowers and the
Lenders agree that the Administrative Agent may delegate any of its duties under
this Agreement to any of its Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such
Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and employees) which performs duties in
connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits of the
indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to which the
Administrative Agent is entitled under Articles VIII and X.

         Section 8.15      Syndication Agents, Senior Managing Agents, Managing
Agents, etc. Neither any of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as a
"co-agent" nor any Syndication Agent, Senior Managing Agent or Managing Agent
shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under
this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same
acknowledgments

                                      -47-

<PAGE>

with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the Administrative
Agent in Section 8.11.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         Section 9.1       Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of
the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that
(a) no Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations under
the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each Lender, (b) any
assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 9.3, and (c)
any transfer by Participation must be made in compliance with Section 9.2. Any
attempted assignment or transfer by any party not made in compliance with this
Section 9.1 shall be null and void, unless such attempted assignment or transfer
is treated as a participation in accordance with Section 9.2. The parties to
this Agreement acknowledge that clause (b) of this Section 9.1 relates only to
absolute assignments and this Section 9.1 does not prohibit assignments creating
security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or assignment
by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any
Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund,
any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations to its
trustee; provided, that no such pledge or assignment creating a security
interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder
unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of
Section 9.3. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan
or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until such Person complies with Section 9.3; provided, that the Administrative
Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions
from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments
relating to such Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to
any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all
the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or
consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a
Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on
any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

         Section 9.2       Participations.

                  9.2.1.   Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may at any
         time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
         participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held
         by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of
         such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by
         a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
         obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such
         Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
         the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner
         of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence
         thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable
         by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be determined as if such
         Lender had not sold such participating interests,

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

         and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal
         solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
         rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  9.2.2.   Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole
         right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any
         amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan
         Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect
         to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest
         which would require consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms
         of Section 10.2 or of any other Loan Document.

                  9.2.3.   Benefit of Certain Provisions. Each Borrower agrees
         that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff
         provided in Section 10.7 in respect of its participating interest in
         amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the
         amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a
         Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain
         the right of setoff provided in Section 10.7 with respect to the amount
         of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree
         to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
         right of setoff provided in Section 10.7, agrees to share with each
         Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of
         setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 2.16(c) as
         if each Participant were a Lender. The Borrowers further agree that
         each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13,
         2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
         acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.3, provided
         that (a) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
         payment under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 than the Lender who sold the
         participating interest to such Participant would have received had it
         retained such interest for its own account, unless the sale of such
         interest to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of
         MetLife, and (b) any Participant not incorporated under the laws of the
         United States of America or any State thereof agrees to comply with the
         provisions of Section 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender.

         Section 9.3       Assignments.

                  9.3.1.   Permitted Assignments. Subject to Section 9.3.2, any
         Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities
         ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations under the
         Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of
         Exhibit A or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties
         thereto. Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not
         a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either
         be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Loans of
         the assigning Lender or (unless each of MetLife and the Administrative
         Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than
         $5,000,000. The amount of the assignment shall be based on the
         Commitment or outstanding Loans (if the Commitment has been terminated)
         subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment
         or as of the "Trade Date," if the "Trade Date" is specified in the
         assignment.

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

                  9.3.2.   Consents. The consent of MetLife shall be required
         prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a
         Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, provided that the
         consent of MetLife shall not be required if an Event of Default has
         occurred and is continuing. The consent of the Administrative Agent
         shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the
         Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.
         Any consent required under this Section 9.3.2 shall not be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed.

                  9.3.3    Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the
         Administrative Agent of an assignment, together with any consents
         required by Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2, and (b) payment of a $3,500 fee
         to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such
         fee is waived by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall
         become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment.
         The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the
         effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the
         Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement
         constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights
         and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not
         be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such
         assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to
         this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of
         the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender
         under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original
         party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect
         to the Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser without any
         further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the
         Administrative Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
         Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be
         entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the
         Loans and all interest and fees with respect thereto and termination of
         the applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
         rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
         this Section 9.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
         sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations
         in accordance with Section 9.2. Upon the consummation of any assignment
         to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 9.3.3, the transferor Lender,
         the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall, if the transferor
         Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes,
         make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate,
         replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes
         or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in
         each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments,
         as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

                  9.3.4    Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for
         this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its
         offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
         delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
         addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts
         of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
         time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
         conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
         may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant
         to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

         Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall
         be available for inspection by any Borrower and any Lender, at any
         reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         Section 9.4       Dissemination of Information. The Borrowers authorize
each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person
acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such
Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries, including without limitation any information contained in any
audit reports pertaining to any Borrower's assets; provided that each Transferee
and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 10.11 of this
Agreement.

         Section 9.5       Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document
is transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 2.15(e).

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 10.1      Notices. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and
other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be
delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

                  (a)      if to MetLife, the Company or Funding, to it at One
         MetLife Plaza, Area 7B, Long Island City, NY 11101, Attention: Tracey
         Dedrick (Fax: (212) 578-0266);

                  (b)      if to the Administrative Agent, to 1 Bank One Plaza,
         Chicago, Illinois 60670, Attention: Mark Goldstein (Fax: (212)
         373-1439); and

                  (c)      if to any Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy
         number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

         Section 10.2      Waivers; Amendments.

                  (a)      No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or
         any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as
         a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
         right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
         enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
         thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and
         remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are
         cumulative and are not exclusive

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

         of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
         any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the
         Borrowers therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same
         shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such
         waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
         for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of
         any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any
         Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b)      Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may
         be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or
         agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required
         Lenders or by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent with the
         consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall
         (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent
         of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce
         the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
         without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii)
         postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any
         Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce
         the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the
         scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
         consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.16(b) or
         (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
         required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, or (v)
         change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of
         "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number
         or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights
         hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder,
         without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no
         such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
         duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written
         consent of the Administrative Agent.

         Section 10.3      Expenses; Indemnity: Damage; Waiver.

                  (a)      Each Borrower jointly and severally agrees to pay (i)
         all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
         Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and
         disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection
         with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the
         preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments,
         modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the
         transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and
         (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or
         any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
         counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with
         the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this
         Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection
         with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket
         expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in
         respect of such Loans.

                  (b)      Each Borrower jointly and severally agrees to
         indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related
         Party of any of the foregoing

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

         Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and
         hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
         damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges
         and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
         asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or
         as a result of (i) the use or proposed use of the proceeds of any Loan,
         or (ii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
         proceeding relating thereto, whether based on contract, tort or any
         other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party
         thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee,
         be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
         liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                  (c)      To the extent that the Borrowers fail to pay any
         amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under
         paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to
         pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage
         (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or
         indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the
         unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or
         related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
         against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such.

                  (d)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
         Borrowers shall not assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim
         against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special,
         indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
         actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of,
         this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
         Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e)      All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
         not later than 10 days after written demand therefor.

         Section 10.4      Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties made by the Borrowers herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any
Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty
at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and
unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The
provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 10.3 and Article VIII shall survive
and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

         Section 10.5      Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall
constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements
with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire
contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.1, this Agreement
shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative
Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         Section 10.6      Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         Section 10.7      Right of Setoff. Subject to Section 2.16(c), if an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of
its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the
credit or the account of the relevant Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held
by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

         Section 10.8      Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process.

                  (a)      This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
         and governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b)      Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction
         of any United States Federal or New York State court sitting in New
         York, New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
         to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,
         and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may
         be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
         permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
         agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
         conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
         judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
         Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any
         Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
         this Agreement against the Borrowers or their respective properties in
         the courts of any jurisdiction.

<PAGE>

                  (c)      Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
         objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
         any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
         Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.
         Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
         extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
         maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  (d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
         service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.1.
         Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
         Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

         Section 10.9      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         Section 10.10     Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         Section 10.11     Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of
or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Company
or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than
as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Company. In the event that any Lender becomes legally compelled
to disclose any confidential Information pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Section, such Lender shall give prompt written notice of that fact to the

                                      -55-

Borrowers prior to the disclosure so that the Borrowers may seek an appropriate
remedy to prevent or limit such disclosure and the Lenders shall cooperate
reasonably (at the expense of the Borrowers) with the Borrowers in seeking such
remedy. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information
received from the Company relating to the Company or its business, other than
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
on a nonconfidential basis, prior to disclosure by the Company; provided that,
in the case of information received from the Company after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Borrowers and all other parties to the
transactions contemplated hereunder hereby agree that all parties (and each
employee, representative, or other agent of such parties) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. "tax treatment" or
"tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section
1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereunder and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such
parties relating to such U.S. "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4); provided, that to
the extent any document contains Information that relates to the U.S. "tax
treatment" or "tax structure" and contains other information, this paragraph
shall only apply to the information relating to the U.S. "tax treatment" or "tax
structure."

         Subject to the following two sentences, a particular Level Status shall
exist with respect to a Borrower on a particular day if on such day such
Borrower does not qualify for a Level Status with more advantageous pricing and
either the Moody's Rating or the S&P Rating is at least equal to the
corresponding rating specified for such Level Status in the table above. In the
event of a difference in the equivalent "rating level" from S&P and Moody's
resulting in a split of only one level, then the Level Status shall be
determined by reference to the higher of the two Ratings. In the event of a
difference in the equivalent "rating level" from S&P and Moody's resulting in a
split of greater than one level, then the Level Status shall be that Level
Status one above the Level Status determined by reference to the lower of the
two Ratings. The above ratings are in the format of S&P Rating/Moody's Rating.

         For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the
following meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:

         "Level Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III
Status, Level IV Status or Level V Status.

         "Moody's Rating" means, at any time, the long term unsecured senior,
non-credit enhanced debt rating of a Borrower issued by Moody's and then in
effect.

         "Rating" means Moody's Rating or S&P Rating.

<PAGE>

         "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the long term unsecured senior,
non-credit enhanced debt rating of a Borrower issued by S&P and then in effect.

         The Applicable Margin, Applicable Utilization Fee Rate and Applicable
Term Out Premium Rate shall be determined for each Borrower in accordance with
the foregoing table based on such Borrower's Level Status as determined from its
then-current Moody's and S&P Ratings. The Applicable Facility Fee Rate for all
Borrowers shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing table based on
the Level Status of the Borrower which has the lowest Level Status of all
Borrowers. The Rating in effect on any date for the purposes of this Schedule is
that in effect at the close of business on such date. If at any time a Borrower
has no Moody's Rating or no S&P Rating or such Borrower does not qualify for a
Level Status with more advantageous pricing, Level V Status shall exist with
respect to such Borrower; provided, that if Funding has no Moody's Rating or S&P
Rating, it shall be deemed to have the same Level Status as the Company or
MetLife, whichever has the lower Level Status. For the purpose of this Schedule
2.10 and the Credit Agreement, Level I Status is the highest Level Status and
Level V Status is the lowest Level Status.

                                DISCLOSED MATTERS

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      Sales Practices Claims


      Over the past several years, Metropolitan Life, New England Mutual Life
Insurance Company ("New England Mutual") and General American Life Insurance
Company ("General American") have faced numerous claims, including class action
lawsuits, alleging improper marketing and sales of individual life insurance
policies or annuities. These lawsuits are generally referred to as "sales
practices claims."

      In December 1999, a federal court approved a settlement resolving sales
practices claims on behalf of a class of owners of permanent life insurance
policies and annuity contracts or certificates issued pursuant to individual
sales in the United States by Metropolitan Life, Metropolitan Insurance and
Annuity Company or Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company between January 1,
1982 and December 31, 1997. The class includes owners of approximately six
million in-force or terminated insurance policies and approximately one million
in-force or terminated annuity contracts or certificates.

      Similar sales practices class actions against New England Mutual, with
which Metropolitan Life merged in 1996, and General American, which was acquired
in 2000, have been settled. In October 2000, a federal court approved a
settlement resolving sales practices claims on behalf of a class of owners of
permanent life insurance policies issued by New England Mutual between January
1, 1983 through August 31, 1996. The class includes owners of approximately
600,000 in-force or terminated policies. A federal court has approved a
settlement resolving sales practices claims on behalf of a class of owners of
permanent life insurance policies issued by General American between January 1,
1982 through December 31, 1996. An appellate court has affirmed the order
approving the settlement. The class includes owners of approximately 250,000
in-force or terminated policies. Implementation of the General American class
action settlement is proceeding.

      Certain class members have opted out of the class action settlements noted
above and have brought or continued non-class action sales practices lawsuits.
In addition, other sales practices lawsuits have been brought. As of December
31, 2002, there are approximately 420 sales practices lawsuits pending against
Metropolitan Life, approximately 60 sales practices lawsuits pending against New
England Mutual and approximately 35 sales practices lawsuits pending against
General American. Metropolitan Life, New England Mutual and General American
continue to defend themselves vigorously against these lawsuits. Some individual
sales practices claims have been resolved through settlement, won by dispositive
motions, or, in a few instances, have gone to trial. Most of the current cases
seek substantial damages, including in some cases punitive and treble damages
and attorneys' fees. Additional litigation relating to the Company's marketing
and sales of individual life insurance may be commenced in the future.

      The Metropolitan Life class action settlement did not resolve two putative
class actions involving sales practices claims filed against Metropolitan Life
in Canada, and these actions remain pending. In March 2002, a purported class
action complaint was filed in a federal court in Kansas by S-G Metals
Industries, Inc. against New England Mutual. The complaint seeks certification
of a class on behalf of corporations and banks that purchased participating life
insurance policies, as well as persons who purchased participating policies for
use in pension plans or through work site marketing. These policyholders were
not part of the New England Mutual class action settlement noted above. The
action was transferred to a federal court in Massachusetts. New England Mutual
moved to dismiss the case and in November 2002, the federal district court
dismissed the case. S-G Metals has filed a notice of appeal. New England Mutual
intends to continue to defend itself vigorously against the case.
<PAGE>
      The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated
financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for sales
practices claims against Metropolitan Life, New England Mutual and General
American.

      Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had investigations
or inquiries relating to Metropolitan Life's, New England Mutual's or General
American's sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities. Over the
past several years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory
authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief. The
Company may continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner.

      Asbestos-Related Claims

      Metropolitan Life is a defendant in thousands of lawsuits seeking
compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by
exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products. Metropolitan Life has
never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or
selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has Metropolitan Life
issued liability or workers' compensation insurance to companies in the business
of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or
asbestos-containing products. Rather, these lawsuits have principally been based
upon allegations relating to certain research, publication and other activities
of one or more of Metropolitan Life's employees during the period from the
1920's through approximately the 1950's and alleging that Metropolitan Life
learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and,
among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health
risks. Metropolitan Life believes that it should not have legal liability in
such cases.

      Legal theories asserted against Metropolitan Life have included
negligence, intentional tort claims and conspiracy claims concerning the health
risks associated with asbestos. Although Metropolitan Life believes it has
meritorious defenses to these claims, and has not suffered any adverse monetary
judgments in respect of these claims, due to the risks and expenses of
litigation, almost all past cases have been resolved by settlements.
Metropolitan Life's defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) to
plaintiffs' claims include that: (i) Metropolitan Life owed no duty to the
plaintiffs -- it had no special relationship with the plaintiffs and did not
manufacture, produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly
injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs cannot demonstrate justifiable detrimental
reliance; and (iii) plaintiffs cannot demonstrate proximate causation. In
defending asbestos cases, Metropolitan Life selects various strategies depending
upon the jurisdictions in which such cases are brought and other factors which,
in Metropolitan Life's judgment, best protect Metropolitan Life's interests.
Strategies include seeking to settle or compromise claims, motions challenging
the legal or factual basis for such claims or defending on the merits at trial.
In early 2002 and in early 2003, two trial courts granted motions dismissing
claims against Metropolitan Life on some or all of the above grounds. Other
courts have denied motions brought by Metropolitan Life to dismiss cases without
the necessity of trial. There can be no assurance that Metropolitan Life will
receive favorable decisions on motions in the future. Metropolitan Life intends
to continue to exercise its best judgment regarding settlement or defense of
such cases, including when trials of these cases are appropriate.

      The following table sets forth the total number of asbestos personal
injury claims pending against Metropolitan Life as of the dates indicated, the
number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and the total
settlement payments made to resolve asbestos personal injury claims during those
years:

----------
(1)   Settlement payments represent payments made by Metropolitan Life during
      the year in connection with settlements made in that year and in prior
      years. Amounts do not include Metropolitan Life's attorneys' fees and
      expenses and do not reflect amounts received from insurance carriers.

      During the fourth quarter of 2002, Metropolitan Life analyzed its claims
experience and reviewed external publications and numerous variables to identify
trends and assessed their impact on its recorded asbestos liability. Certain
publications suggest a trend towards more asbestos-related claims and a greater
awareness of asbestos litigation generally by potential plaintiffs and
plaintiffs' lawyers. Plaintiffs' lawyers continue to advertise heavily with
respect to asbestos litigation. Bankruptcies and reorganizations of other
defendants in asbestos litigation may increase the pressures on remaining
defendants, including Metropolitan Life. Through the first nine months of 2002,
the number of new claims received by Metropolitan Life was lower than those
received during the comparable 2001 period. However, the number of new claims
received by Metropolitan Life during the fourth quarter of 2002 was
significantly higher than those received in the prior year quarter, resulting in
more new claims being received by Metropolitan Life in 2002 than in 2001.
Factors considered also included expected trends in filing cases, the dates of
initial exposure of plaintiffs to asbestos, the likely percentage of total
asbestos claims which included Metropolitan Life as a defendant and experience
in claims settlement negotiations.

      Metropolitan Life also considered views derived from actuarial
calculations it made in the fourth quarter of 2002. These calculations were made
using, among other things, current information regarding Metropolitan Life's
claims and settlement experience, information available in public reports, as
well as a study regarding the possible future incidence of mesothelioma. Based
on all of the above information, including greater than expected claims
experience over the last three years, Metropolitan Life expects to receive more
claims in the future than it had previously expected. Previously, Metropolitan
Life's liability reflected that the increase in asbestos-related claims was a
result of an acceleration in the reporting of such claims; the liability now
reflects that such an increase is also the result of an increase in the total
number of asbestos-related claims expected to be received by Metropolitan Life.
Accordingly, Metropolitan Life increased its recorded liability for
asbestos-related claims by $402 million from approximately $820 million to
$1,225 million at December 31, 2002. This total recorded asbestos-related
liability (after the self-insured retention) is within the coverage of the
excess insurance policies discussed below.

      During 1998, Metropolitan Life paid $878 million in premiums for excess
insurance policies for asbestos-related claims. The excess insurance policies
for asbestos-related claims provide for recovery of losses up to $1,500 million,
which is in excess of a $400 million self-insured retention. The
asbestos-related policies are also subject to annual and per-claim sublimits.
Amounts are recoverable under the policies annually with respect to claims paid
during the prior calendar year. Although amounts paid by Metropolitan Life in
any given year that may be recoverable in the next calendar year under the
policies will be reflected as a reduction in the Company's operating cash flows
for the year in which they are paid, management believes that the payments will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity.

      Each asbestos-related policy contains an experience fund and a reference
fund that provides for payments to Metropolitan Life at the commutation date if
the reference fund is greater than zero at commutation or pro rata
<PAGE>
reductions from time to time in the loss reimbursements to Metropolitan Life if
the cumulative return on the reference fund is less than the return specified in
the experience fund. The return in the reference fund is tied to performance of
the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. A
claim will be made under the excess insurance policies in 2003 for the amounts
paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of the retention. Based on
performance of the reference fund, at December 31, 2002, the loss reimbursements
to Metropolitan Life in 2003 and the recoverable with respect to later periods
will be $42 million less than the amount of the recorded losses. Such foregone
loss reimbursements may be recovered upon commutation depending upon future
performance of the reference fund. The foregone loss reimbursements are
estimated to be $9 million with respect to 2002 claims and $42 million in the
aggregate.

      The $402 million increase in the recorded liability for asbestos claims
less the foregone loss reimbursement adjustment of $42 million ($27 million, net
of income tax) resulted in an increase in the recoverable of $360 million. At
December 31, 2002, a portion ($136 million) of the $360 million recoverable was
recognized in income while the remainder ($224 million) was recorded as a
deferred gain which is expected to be recognized in income in the future over
the estimated settlement period of the excess insurance policies. The $402
million increase in the recorded liability, less the portion of the recoverable
recognized in income, resulted in a net expense of $266 million ($169 million,
net of income tax). The $360 million recoverable may change depending on the
future performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Lehman Brothers
Aggregate Bond Index.

      As a result of the excess insurance policies, $1,237 million is recorded
as a recoverable at December 31, 2002 ($224 million of which is recorded as a
deferred gain as mentioned above); the amount includes recoveries expected to be
obtained in 2003 for amounts paid in 2002. If at some point in the future, the
Company believes the liability for probable and estimable losses for
asbestos-related claims should be increased, an expense would be recorded and
the insurance recoverable would be adjusted subject to the terms, conditions and
limits of the excess insurance policies. Portions of the change in the insurance
recoverable would be recorded as a deferred gain and amortized into income over
the estimated remaining settlement period of the insurance policies.

      The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated
financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for
asbestos-related claims. The ability of Metropolitan Life to estimate its
ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty due to
numerous factors. The availability of data is limited and it is difficult to
predict with any certainty numerous variables that can affect liability
estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims,
the disease mix and severity of disease, the jurisdiction of claims filed, tort
reform efforts and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their
amounts.

      Recent bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, as
well as advertising by plaintiffs' asbestos lawyers, may be resulting in an
increase in the number of claims and the cost of resolving claims, as well as
the number of trials and possible adverse verdicts Metropolitan Life may
experience. Plaintiffs are seeking additional funds from defendants, including
Metropolitan Life, in light of such recent bankruptcies by certain other
defendants. It is likely that bills will be introduced in 2003 in the United
States Congress to reform asbestos litigation. While the Company strongly
supports reform efforts, there can be no assurance that legislative reforms will
be enacted. Metropolitan Life will continue to study its claims experience,
review external literature regarding asbestos claims experience in the United
States and consider numerous variables that can affect its asbestos liability
exposure, including bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos
litigation and legislative and judicial developments, to identify trends and to
assess their impact on the recorded asbestos liability.

      The number of asbestos cases that may be brought or the aggregate amount
of any liability that Metropolitan Life may ultimately incur is uncertain.
Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that the Company's total exposure
<PAGE>
to asbestos claims may be greater than the liability recorded by the Company in
its consolidated financial statements and that future charges to income may be
necessary. While the potential future charges could be material in particular
quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information
currently known by management, it does not believe any such charges are likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.

      Property and Casualty Actions

      Purported class action suits involving claims by policyholders for the
alleged diminished value of automobiles after accident-related repairs have been
filed in Rhode Island, Texas, Georgia and Tennessee against Metropolitan
Property and Casualty Insurance Company. Rhode Island and Texas trial courts
denied plaintiffs' motions for class certification and a hearing on plaintiffs'
motion in Tennessee for class certification is to be scheduled. A settlement has
been reached in the Georgia class action; the Company determined to settle the
case in light of a Georgia Supreme Court decision involving another insurer. The
settlement is being implemented. A purported class action has been filed against
Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company's subsidiary, Metropolitan
Casualty Insurance Company, in Florida. The complaint alleges breach of contract
and unfair trade practices with respect to allowing the use of parts not made by
the original manufacturer to repair damaged automobiles. Discovery is ongoing
and a motion for class certification is pending. Total loss valuation methods
are the subject of national class actions involving other insurance companies. A
Pennsylvania state court purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleges
that Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company improperly took
depreciation on partial homeowner losses where the insured replaced the covered
item. The court has dismissed the action. An appeal has been filed. Metropolitan
Property and Casualty Insurance Company and Metropolitan Casualty Insurance
Company are vigorously defending themselves against these lawsuits.

      Demutualization Actions

      Several lawsuits were brought in 2000 challenging the fairness of
Metropolitan Life's plan of reorganization and the adequacy and accuracy of
Metropolitan Life's disclosure to policyholders regarding the plan. These
actions name as defendants some or all of Metropolitan Life, the Holding
Company, the individual directors, the Superintendent and the underwriters for
MetLife, Inc.'s initial public offering, Goldman Sachs & Company and Credit
Suisse First Boston. Five purported class actions pending in the New York state
court in New York County were consolidated within the commercial part. In
addition, there remained a separate purported class action in New York state
court in New York County. On February 21, 2003, the defendants' motions to
dismiss both the consolidated action and separate action were granted; leave to
replead as a proceeding under Article 78 of New York's Civil Practice Law and
Rules has been granted in the separate action. Another purported class action in
New York state court in Kings County has been voluntarily held in abeyance by
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs in the state court class actions seek injunctive,
declaratory and compensatory relief, as well as an accounting and, in some
instances, punitive damages. Some of the plaintiffs in the above described
actions also have brought a proceeding under Article 78 of New York's Civil
Practice Law and Rules challenging the Opinion and Decision of the
Superintendent who approved the plan. In this proceeding, petitioners seek to
vacate the Superintendent's Opinion and Decision and enjoin him from granting
final approval of the plan. This case also is being held in abeyance by
plaintiffs. Another purported class action was filed in New York state court in
New York County on behalf of a purported class of beneficiaries of Metropolitan
Life annuities purchased to fund structured settlements claiming that the class
members should have received common stock or cash in connection with the
demutualization. Metropolitan Life's motion to dismiss this case was granted in
a decision filed on October 31, 2002. Plaintiff has withdrawn her notice of
appeal. Three purported class actions were filed in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming violation of the Securities
Act of 1933. The plaintiffs in these actions, which have been consolidated,
claim that the Policyholder Information Booklets relating to the plan failed to
disclose certain material facts and seek
<PAGE>
rescission and compensatory damages. Metropolitan Life's motion to dismiss these
three cases was denied in 2001. On February 4, 2003, plaintiffs filed a
consolidated amended complaint adding a fraud claim under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. A purported class action also was filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking damages from
Metropolitan Life and the Holding Company for alleged violations of various
provisions of the Constitution of the United States in connection with the plan
of reorganization. In 2001, pursuant to a motion to dismiss filed by
Metropolitan Life, this case was dismissed by the District Court. In January
2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the
dismissal. Metropolitan Life, the Holding Company and the individual defendants
believe they have meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs' claims and are
contesting vigorously all of the plaintiffs' claims in these actions.

      In 2001, a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Justice, Ontario,
Canada on behalf of a proposed class of certain former Canadian policyholders
against the Holding Company, Metropolitan Life, and Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company of Canada. Plaintiffs' allegations concern the way that their policies
were treated in connection with the demutualization of Metropolitan Life; they
seek damages, declarations, and other non-pecuniary relief. The defendants
believe they have meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs' claims and will
contest vigorously all of plaintiffs' claims in this matter.

      In July 2002, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of a proposed class comprised of the
settlement class in the Metropolitan Life sales practices class action
settlement approved in December 1999 by the United States District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania. The Holding Company, Metropolitan Life, the
trustee of the policyholder trust, and certain present and former individual
directors and officers of Metropolitan Life are named as defendants. Plaintiffs'
allegations concern the treatment of the cost of the settlement in connection
with the demutualization of Metropolitan Life and the adequacy and accuracy of
the disclosure, particularly with respect to those costs. Plaintiffs seek
compensatory, treble and punitive damages, as well as attorneys' fees and costs.
The defendants' motion to transfer the lawsuit to the Western District of
Pennsylvania was granted on February 14, 2003. The defendants' motion to dismiss
is pending. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class certification which the
Texas court has adjourned. The defendants believe they have meritorious defenses
to the plaintiffs' claims and will contest them vigorously.

      Race-Conscious Underwriting Claims

      Insurance Departments in a number of states initiated inquiries in 2000
about possible race-conscious underwriting of life insurance. These inquiries
generally have been directed to all life insurers licensed in their respective
states, including Metropolitan Life and certain of its affiliates. The New York
Insurance Department has concluded its examination of Metropolitan Life
concerning possible past race-conscious underwriting practices. Metropolitan
Life has cooperated fully with that inquiry. Four purported class action
lawsuits filed against Metropolitan Life in 2000 and 2001 alleging racial
discrimination in the marketing, sale, and administration of life insurance
policies have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages,
punitive damages, reformation, imposition of a constructive trust, a declaration
that the alleged practices are discriminatory and illegal, injunctive relief
requiring Metropolitan Life to discontinue the alleged discriminatory practices
and adjust policy values, and other relief. Metropolitan Life has entered into
settlement agreements to resolve the regulatory examination and the actions
pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The class action settlement, which has received preliminary approval from
the court, must receive final approval before it can be implemented. A fairness
hearing was held on February 7, 2003. The regulatory settlement agreement is
conditioned upon final approval of the class action settlement. Metropolitan
Life recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the
anticipated resolution of these matters and believes that charge is adequate to
cover the costs associated with these settlements.
<PAGE>
      Sixteen lawsuits involving approximately 125 plaintiffs have been filed in
federal and state court in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee alleging federal
and/or state law claims of racial discrimination in connection with the sale,
formation, administration or servicing of life insurance policies. Metropolitan
Life is contesting vigorously plaintiffs' claims in these actions.

      Other

      In 2001, a putative class action was filed against Metropolitan Life in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging
gender discrimination and retaliation in the MetLife Financial Services unit of
the Individual segment. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages,
punitive damages, a declaration that the alleged practices are discriminatory
and illegal, injunctive relief requiring Metropolitan Life to discontinue the
alleged discriminatory practices, an order restoring class members to their
rightful positions (or appropriate compensation in lieu thereof), and other
relief. Metropolitan Life is vigorously defending itself against these
allegations.

      A lawsuit has been filed against Metropolitan Life in Ontario, Canada by
Clarica Life Insurance Company regarding the sale of the majority of
Metropolitan Life's Canadian operation to Clarica in 1998. Clarica alleges that
Metropolitan Life breached certain representations and warranties contained in
the sale agreement, that Metropolitan Life made misrepresentations upon which
Clarica relied during the negotiations and that Metropolitan Life was negligent
in the performance of certain of its obligations and duties under the sale
agreement. Metropolitan Life is vigorously defending itself against this
lawsuit.

      A putative class action lawsuit is pending in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia, in which plaintiffs allege that they were
denied certain ad hoc pension increases awarded to retirees under the
Metropolitan Life retirement plan. The ad hoc pension increases were awarded
only to retirees (i.e., individuals who were entitled to an immediate retirement
benefit upon their termination of employment) and not available to individuals
like these plaintiffs whose employment, or whose spouses' employment, had
terminated before they became eligible for an immediate retirement benefit. The
district court denied the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment to allow
for discovery. Discovery has not yet commenced pending the court's ruling as to
the timing of a class certification motion. The plaintiffs seek to represent a
class consisting of former Metropolitan Life employees, or their surviving
spouses, who are receiving deferred vested annuity payments under the retirement
plan and who were allegedly eligible to receive the ad hoc pension increases
awarded in 1977, 1980, 1989, 1992, 1996 and 2001, as well as increases awarded
in earlier years. Metropolitan Life is vigorously defending itself against these
allegations.

      A reinsurer of universal life policy liabilities of Metropolitan Life and
certain affiliates is seeking rescission and has commenced an arbitration
proceeding claiming that, during underwriting, material misrepresentations or
omissions were made. The reinsurer also has sent a notice purporting to increase
reinsurance premium rates. Metropolitan Life and these affiliates intend to
vigorously defend themselves against the claims of the reinsurer, including the
purported rate increase.

      The SEC is conducting an examination at New England Securities. The
examination commenced in March 2003 after the company notified the SEC of an
operational issue involving one of its advisory products.

      In April 2003, a federal court jury in Arizona awarded approximately $85
million to the plaintiff in a case involving a claim for benefits under a
General American individual disability income policy. The defendants, which
include General American, have filed or will file post trial motions and, if
they are denied, will appeal the judgment. A substantial amount of General
American's individual disability income business is reinsured with various
carriers.
<PAGE>
      Various litigation, claims and assessments against the Company, in
addition to those discussed above and those otherwise provided for in the
Company's consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of the
Company's business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its
activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer.
Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state
authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the
Company's compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.

      Summary

      It is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all
pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide reasonable ranges of
potential losses, except as noted above in connection with specific matters. In
some of the matters referred to above, very large and/or indeterminate amounts,
including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these
considerations it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could
have a material adverse effect upon the Company's consolidated financial
position, based on information currently known by the Company's management, in
its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings
are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or
indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent
unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in
certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
annual periods.

                                 FORM OF OPINION

                                 April 25, 2003

To the Lenders Referred to Below and
Bank One, NA, as
  Administrative Agent
1 Bank One Plaza
Chicago, Illinois  60670

Dear Sirs:

                  I am an Assistant General Counsel of Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company (the "Company"), a New York stock life insurance company, and
in such capacity have represented the Company, MetLife, Inc. ("MetLife"), a
Delaware corporation, and MetLife Funding, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Funding" and together with the Company and MetLife, the "Borrowers"), in
connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of April 25, 2003 (the "Credit
Agreement"), among the Borrowers, the lenders named therein and Bank One, NA, as
Administrative Agent, providing for loans to be made by said lenders to the
Borrowers in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1,000,000,000. Terms
defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meanings. This
opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 4.1(e) of the Credit Agreement.

                  In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have examined
originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of
such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other
instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I
have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

                  In my examination, I have assumed the authenticity of all
documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with authentic
original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. When relevant
facts were not independently established, I have relied upon statements of
governmental officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to the
Credit Agreement.

                  In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed,
with respect to the Credit Agreement, that (except, to the extent expressly set
forth in the opinions below, as to the Borrowers):

                  (i)      it has been duly authorized by, has been duly
         executed and delivered by, and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
         and enforceable obligations of, all of the parties thereto;

                  (ii)     all signatories thereto have been duly authorized;
         and

                                      B-1

<PAGE>

                  (iii)    all of the parties thereto are duly organized and
         validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other)
         to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Agreement.

                  Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

                  1.       (a) MetLife is a corporation duly organized,
         validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware; (b)
         the Company is a stock life insurance company duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of New York; (c) Funding
         is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
         under the laws of Delaware; (d) each of the Borrowers has all requisite
         corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
         conducted; and (e) except where the failure to do so, individually or
         in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
         Material Adverse Change, MetLife and each of its Material Subsidiaries
         is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every
         jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

                  2.       The Transactions are within each Borrower's corporate
         powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.
         The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
         Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
         Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
         principles of equity, including principles of commercial
         reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether
         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

                  3.       The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or
         approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any
         Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and
         are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law
         or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents
         of any Borrower or any order of any Governmental Authority, and (c)
         will not violate or result in a default under any material indenture,
         agreement or other instrument binding upon any Borrower or its assets,
         or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by
         any Borrower.

                  4.       There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or
         before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to
         my knowledge, threatened against or affecting MetLife or any of its
         Material Subsidiaries (a) as to which there is a reasonable possibility
         of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, is
         reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
         Material Adverse Change (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (b) that
         involve the Credit Agreement or the Transactions.

                  5.       Neither MetLife nor any of its Material Subsidiaries
         (other than Funding) is an "investment company" as defined in, or
         subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and
         Funding is an "investment company" as defined in such Act that is
         exempt from the requirements of such Act. Neither MetLife nor any of
         its

                                      B-2

         Material Subsidiaries is a "holding company" as defined in, or subject
         to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

                  6.       The Support Agreement was duly authorized by all
         necessary corporate action of the Company and Funding. The Support
         Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Company
         and Funding and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
         each of the Company and Funding, enforceable in accordance with its
         terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and
         subject to general principles of equity, including principles of
         commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of
         whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

                  The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments
and qualifications:

                  (A)      The enforceability of Section 10.3 of the Credit
         Agreement may be limited by laws or public policy limiting the
         enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party, or
         requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action
         or inaction.

                  (B)      The enforceability of provisions of the Credit
         Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except
         in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.

                  (C)      I express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws
         of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than the
         State of New York) that limit the interest, fees or other charges such
         Lenders may impose, (ii) the last sentence of Section 2.16(c) of the
         Credit Agreement, and (iii) the first sentence of Section 10.8(b) of
         the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject
         matter jurisdiction of United States Federal Courts sitting in New
         York, New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit
         Agreement.

                  The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the
Federal laws of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York
and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I do not express
any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.

                  This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the
above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose
or relied upon by any other Person (other than your successors and assigns as
Lenders and Persons that acquire participations in the Loans) without my prior
written consent.

                                Very truly yours,

                                      B-3
