agreement, upon written request of either Party, the matter will be referred for resolution
to a steering committee established pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.3(a) (the &#147;<U>Steering
Committee</U>&#148;). The Steering Committee will have two members, one of whom will be
appointed by FIS and the other of whom will be appointed by LPS, and each of whom shall be a
senior executive of the Party appointing the member. The Steering Committee will make a
good faith effort to promptly resolve all Disputes referred to it. Steering Committee
decisions will be unanimous and will be binding on FIS and LPS. If the Steering Committee
does not agree to a resolution of a Dispute within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the reference of
the matter to it, the Dispute will be referred to the Chief Executive Officers of FIS and
LPS. If the Chief Executive Officers do not agree to a resolution of the Dispute within
fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the reference of the matter to them, then the Parties will be free
to exercise the remedies available to them under applicable law, subject to Sections&nbsp;8.3(b)
and 8.3(c).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <I>Mediation</I>. In the event any Dispute cannot be resolved in a friendly manner as set
forth in Section&nbsp;8.3(a), the Parties intend that such Dispute be resolved by mediation. If
the Steering Committee and the Chief Executive Officers are unable to resolve the Dispute as
contemplated by Section&nbsp;8.3(a), either FIS or LPS may demand mediation of the Dispute by
written notice to the other in which case the Parties will select a mediator within ten (10)
days after the demand. Neither Party may unreasonably withhold consent to the selection of
the mediator. Each of FIS and LPS will bear its own costs of mediation but both Parties
will share the costs of the mediator equally.

set forth in Section&nbsp;8.3(a) or through mediation pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.3(b), the latter
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the submission of the Dispute to mediation, either Party involved
in the Dispute may submit the dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to this Section
8.3(c). All Disputes submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.3(c) shall be
resolved in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, unless the Parties mutually agree to utilize an alternate set of rules, in
which event all references herein to the American Arbitration Association shall be deemed
modified accordingly. Expedited rules shall apply regardless of the amount at issue.
Arbitration proceedings hereunder may be initiated by either Party making a written request
to the American Arbitration Association, together with any appropriate filing fee, at the
office of the American Arbitration Association in Orlando, Florida. The arbitration shall
be by a single qualified arbitrator (&#147;<U>Arbitrator</U>&#148;) experienced in the matters at
issue, such Arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by FIS and LPS. If the parties fail to
agree on an Arbitrator within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after notice of commencement of arbitration,
the American Arbitration Association shall, upon the request of any Party to the dispute or
difference, appoint the Arbitrator. All arbitration proceedings shall be held in the city
of Jacksonville, Florida in a location to be specified by the Arbitrator (or any place
agreed to by the Parties and the Arbitrator). Any order or determination of the arbitral
tribunal shall be final and binding upon the Parties to the arbitration as to matters
submitted and may be enforced by any Party to the Dispute in any court having jurisdiction
over the subject matter or over either Party. The Parties agree that the length of time to
be provided in any arbitration action to conduct discovery shall be limited to ninety (90)
days, the length of time to conduct the arbitration hearing shall be limited to ten (10)
days (with each Party having equal time) and that the Arbitrator shall be required to render
his or her decision within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the completion of the arbitration hearing.
All costs and expenses incurred by the Arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Parties.
Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with any such arbitration
proceeding. The use of any alternative dispute resolution procedures hereunder will not be
construed under the doctrines of laches, waiver or estoppel to affect adversely the rights
of either Party.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) FIS and LPS acknowledge and agree that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by LPS or FIS, misuse of the FIS
Marks by LPS. Accordingly, nothing in this Section&nbsp;8.3 will prevent either FIS or
LPS from seeking injunctive or similar relief in the event (A)&nbsp;any delay resulting
from efforts to mediate such Dispute could result in serious and irreparable injury
to FIS or LPS, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B)&nbsp;of any actual or
threatened breach of any provisions of this Agreement or (C)&nbsp;that the Dispute
relates to, or involves a claim of, actual or threatened infringement of any of the
FIS Marks. All actions for such injunctive or interim relief shall be brought in a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with this Agreement. Such remedy
shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement.

June&nbsp;13, 2008 (the &#147;<U>Distribution Agreement</U>&#148;), pursuant to which, among other things, LPS
has agreed to assume certain liabilities of FIS; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings
set forth in the Distribution Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Assumption of Liabilities</U>. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, LPS hereby
assumes and agrees to pay, honor and discharge when due all of the Assumed Liabilities in
accordance with their respective terms and subject to all of FIS&#146;s associated rights, claims and
defenses. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby agree that if any of the liabilities
contemplated to be assumed by Assignee pursuant to the Distribution Agreement cannot be so assumed
hereunder for any reason (including without limitation the failure to timely obtain a required
third party or governmental consent or approval), then the financial responsibility for such
liabilities shall accrue or otherwise be debited to Assignee until such time as the applicable
liabilities can be properly and fully assumed by Assignee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Third Parties</U>. The assumption by LPS of the liabilities of FIS herein provided is
not intended by the Parties to expand the rights and remedies of any third party against LPS in
respect of such liabilities as compared to the rights and remedies which such third party would
have had against FIS in respect of such liabilities had the Parties not consummated the
transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall, or shall
be construed to, prejudice the right of LPS to contest any claim or demand with respect to any
obligation, liability or commitment assumed hereunder and LPS shall have all rights which FIS may
have or have had to defend or contest any such claim or demand.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>LPS&#146;s Rights</U>. FIS hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints LPS (and each of
LPS&#146;s successors and permitted assigns) its true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full
power of substitution, in its name or otherwise, to pay, discharge, adjust, settle or compromise
any Assumed Liabilities, to prosecute or defend any action or claim in connection therewith, and,
if applicable, to submit to arbitration any controversy relating thereto; <U>provided</U> that

Proceeding, such settlement includes a release of FIS from further liability in connection with the
Assumed Liabilities being settled.

counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to the other Party.
