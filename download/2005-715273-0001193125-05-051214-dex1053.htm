Property is damaged by fire or other casualty which is insured (without regard to deductibles) to an extent as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the affected Property, then no party shall have the right to terminate its obligations under

obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Property by reason thereof and the Closing shall take place without abatement of the Purchase Price, but Owner shall assign to Purchaser at the Closing all of Owner&#146;s interest in any

competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas, and pay into the registry of the court the Deposit, or deposit any such documents with respect to which there is a dispute in the registry of such court, whereupon such Escrow Agent shall be relieved

whether issued with or without jurisdiction, and whether or not subsequently vacated, modified, set aside or reversed. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
