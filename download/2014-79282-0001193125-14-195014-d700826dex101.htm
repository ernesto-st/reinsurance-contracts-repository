expenses of the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be allocated between the Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not

claimed by the Representative, and if the Dispute Resolution Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall
be allocated sixty percent (60%)&nbsp;(i.e., 300 &divide; 500) to the Parent and forty percent (40%)&nbsp;(i.e., 200 &divide; 500) to the Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders). </P>
