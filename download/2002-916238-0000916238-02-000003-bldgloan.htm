Thereafter, Lender's Estimate of Cost will take into account, in addition to the subcontracts and purchase orders, other considerations that Lender, in its reasonable discretion, deems relevant or likely to have an impact upon the cost of construction expenses or interest, including current costs for availability of the subcontractors to perform under the subcontracts and purchase orders, past and current expenses for the Project, and other projects similar to the Project, and market rates of interest. If there is an </FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">identity of interest</FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT"> between the Borrower's contractors, any contract between parties having such </FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">identity of interest</FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT"> shall be regarded solely as an estimate for the purpose of this Section.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) Each Request for Advance by the Borrower shall constitute an affirmation that the warranties and representations contained in Article II of this Agreement remain true and correct, and that no breach of the covenants of Borrower contained in this Agreement has occurred, in each case as of the date of the Advance, unless Lender is notified to the contrary prior to funding of the requested Advance.</P>

If Borrower shall fail promptly to bond or discharge any mechanics' lien claim filed or otherwise asserted or to contest any such claims and give security or indemnity in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;7.5 above, or, having commenced to contest the same, and having given such security or indemnity, shall thereafter fail to prosecute such contest in good faith or with due diligence, or fail to maintain such indemnity or security so required by the Title Company for its full amount, or, upon adverse conclusion of any such contest, shall fail to cause any judgment or decree to be satisfied and the lien to be released, then, and in any such event, Lender may at its election (but shall not be required to), (i) procure the release and discharge of any such claim and any judgment or decree thereon, without inquiring into or investigating the amount, validity or enforceability of such lien or claim and (ii) effect any settlement or compromise of the same, or may furnish such security or indemnity to the Title Company, and any amounts so expended by Lender, including premiums paid or security furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be deemed to constitute an Advance of the Loan Proceeds hereunder. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.7 <U>Sign and Publicity</U>.

Lender may appear in any such proceedings and negotiations and Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender copies of all notices and pleadings in any such proceedings. Borrower will in good faith file and prosecute all claims necessary for any award or payment resulting from such damage, destruction or taking. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in exercising its rights under this section shall constitute indebtedness secured by the Mortgage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.2 <U>Application of Insurance Proceeds and Condemnation Awards</U>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) Upon occurrence of any loss or damage to all or any portion of the Project resulting from fire, vandalism, malicious mischief or any other casualty or physical harm (a </FONT>"<U><FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Casualty</U></FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">) or any exercise of the power of condemnation or eminent domain (a </FONT>"<U><FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Taking</U></FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">), Lender may elect to collect all proceeds of any insurance policies collected or claimed as a result of such Casualty and all awards resulting from such Taking. After deduction of all expenses of collection and settlement, including attorney's and adjusters' fees and charges and except as provided in the Mortgage, Lender will apply such proceeds (the </FONT>"<U><FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Proceeds</U></FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">) and such awards (the </FONT>"<U><FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Awards</U></FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">), in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Mortgage. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1 above, Borrower hereby authorizes Lender, at Lender's option, to collect any losses under any insurance with respect to the Project which is kept, or caused to be kept, by Borrower. Any Proceeds or Awards remaining after payment in full of the Loan and all other sums due Lender hereunder shall be paid by Lender to Borrower without any allowance for interest thereon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) In the event Lender does not elect to apply the Proceeds or Awards to prepayment of the Loan or in the event such Proceeds or Awards, if applied, do not fully discharge the Loan or would be insufficient to pay for the costs of restoration of the Project, Borrower will:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i) Proceed with diligence to make settlement (which shall be subject to the prior written approval of Lender) with insurers or with condemning authorities and cause the Proceeds or Awards to be deposited with Lender, unless Lender shall elect to exercise its right under the Mortgage to make such settlement without the consent of Borrower to the extent permitted under the Mortgage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii) In the event of any unreasonable delay in making settlement with insurers or effecting collection of Proceeds or Awards, Borrower shall deposit with Lender the full amount required to meet the obligations due under the Loan, disregarding such Proceeds or Awards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii) In the event the Proceeds or Awards deposited with Lender and the undisbursed or unadvanced proceeds of the Loan are insufficient to place the Loan In Balance, Borrower shall deposit with Lender on demand any amount necessary to place the Loan In Balance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv) Promptly proceed with construction and restoration of the Project, including the repair of all such loss or damage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) All Proceeds, Awards and funds deposited by Borrower hereunder shall first be fully disbursed before an Advance of any further Loan Proceeds. Borrower shall not be entitled to any payment of or credit for interest on such Proceeds, Awards and funds. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) Lender shall not be obligated to see to the proper application of any of the Proceeds nor shall the amount so released or used be deemed a payment on any indebtedness evidenced by the Note or secured by any of the Loan Documents. In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage or other transfer of title in lieu of foreclosure, all right, title and interest of Lender, in and to any insurance policies then in force shall pass to the purchaser or Lender, as the case may be.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) All proceeds of use and occupancy or rental value insurance shall be paid to Lender for the purposes of paying, to the extent available and necessary, in the following order: (i) insurance premiums payable with respect to any insurance required to be carried by Borrower hereunder; (ii) taxes, assessments and charges payable by Borrower under any of the Loan Documents; and (iii) all amounts payable on the Note, together with any and all other amounts evidenced or secured by any of the Loan Documents, and to the extent that such insurance proceeds are available to pay the items listed in clauses&nbsp;(i), (ii) and (iii), Lender shall pay such items for the account of Borrower. All such insurance proceeds not deemed necessary, in Lender's sole opinion, to pay the above items shall be paid over to Borrower.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f) Upon failure on the part of Borrower to promptly commence or continue the repair or restoration of the Project after settlement of any claim with the insurer, Lender shall have the right to apply such Proceeds to the payment of any indebtedness secured by the Loan Documents, and resort to such other remedies available to Lender hereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent Lender from applying at any time the whole or any part of such insurance proceeds to the curing of any Event of Default hereunder.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE IX</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ASSIGNMENTS, SALE AND ENCUMBRANCES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.1 <U>Lender's Right to Assign</U>. Lender may assign, negotiate, pledge or otherwise hypothecate this Agreement or any of its rights and security hereunder, including the Note, and any of the other Loan Documents to any bank, participant or financial institution, and in case of such assignment, Borrower will accord full recognition thereto, and hereby agrees that all rights and remedies of Lender in connection with the interest so assigned shall be enforceable against Borrower by such bank, participant or financial institution with the same force and effect and to the same extent as the same would have been enforceable by Lender but for such assignment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.2 <U>Prohibition of Assignments and Encumbrances by Borrower</U>. Except as otherwise provided in the Mortgage, Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, create, effect, consent to, attempt, contract for, agree to make, suffer or permit any conveyance, sale, assignment, transfer, lien, pledge, mortgage, security interest, encumbrance or alienation (</FONT>"<U><FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Prohibited Transfer</U></FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">) of all or any portion of, or any interest in, the Land, or the Project, whether effected directly, indirectly, voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law or otherwise; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) liens securing the Loan, (ii) the lien of current taxes and assessments not in default, (iii) Leases permitted or approved pursuant to this Agreement, and (iv) the Permitted Exceptions.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE XI</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LENDER'S REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.1 <U>Remedies Conferred Upon Lender</U>. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender, in addition to all remedies conferred upon Lender by law and by the terms of the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, may pursue any one or more of the following remedies concurrently or successively, it being the intent hereof that none of such remedies shall be to the exclusion of any others:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) Withhold further Advances of Loan Proceeds and terminate any or all of its obligations to Borrower.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) Declare the Note to be due and payable forthwith, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) In addition to any rights of set-off that Lender may have under applicable law, Lender may, without notice of any kind to Borrower appropriate and apply to the payment of the Note or of any sums due under this Agreement, any and all balances, deposits, credits, accounts, certificates of deposit, instruments or money of Borrower then or thereafter in the possession of Lender.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) Exercise or pursue any other remedy or cause of action permitted at law or at equity or under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including but not limited to foreclosure of the Mortgage and enforcement of all Loan Documents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) With or without entry upon the Land, cause construction of the Project to be completed. Lender, for such purpose, may use all available materials and equipment located upon the Land and purchase all other necessary materials and employ contractors and other employees. All sums expended by Lender for such purpose shall constitute Advances pursuant hereto and shall be secured by the Mortgage and other Loan Documents and shall forthwith be due and payable by Borrower to Lender with interest thereon at the Default Interest Rate specified in the Note. The authority and agency conferred hereby upon Lender shall be deemed to create a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.2 <U>Right of Lender to Make Advances to Cure Defaults</U>. In the event that Borrower shall fail to perform any of its covenants or agreements herein or in any of the other Loan Documents contained, Lender may (but shall not be required to) perform any of such covenants and agreements, and any amounts so expended by Lender shall be deemed advanced by Lender under an obligation to do so regardless of the identity of the person or persons to whom said funds are disbursed. Loan Proceeds advanced by Lender in the exercise of its judgment that the same are needed to complete the Project to protect its security for the Loan are obligatory advances hereunder and shall constitute additional indebtedness payable on demand which is evidenced and secured by the Loan Documents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.3 <U>Attorneys' Fees</U>. Borrower will pay Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in connection with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if at any time or times hereafter the Lender employs counsel for advice or other representation with respect to any matter concerning Borrower, the Guarantor, this Agreement, the Land or the Loan Documents or to protect, collect, lease, sell, take possession of, or liquidate all or any portion of the Land, or to attempt to enforce or protect any security interest or lien or other right in any of the premises or under any of the Loan Documents, or to enforce any rights of the Lender or obligations of Borrower or any other person, firm or corporation that may be obligated to Lender by virtue of this Agreement or under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreement, instrument or document, heretofore or hereafter delivered to Lender in furtherance hereof, then in any such event, all of the reasonable attorneys' fees arising from such services, and any expenses, costs and charges relating thereto, shall constitute additional indebtedness owing by Borrower to Lender payable on demand, and evidenced and secured by the Loan Documents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.4 <U>No Waiver</U>. No failure by Lender to exercise, or delay by Lender in exercising, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement and in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of each other or of any right or remedy provided by law or equity. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall, in itself entitle Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.5 <U>Availability of Remedies</U>. All of the remedies set forth herein and/or provided by law or equity shall be equally available to Lender, and the choice by Lender of one (1) such alternative over another shall not be subject to question or challenge by Borrower or any other person, nor shall any such choice be asserted as a defense, set-off, or failure to mitigate damages in any action or proceeding by Lender to recover or seeking any other remedy under this Loan Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, nor shall such choice preclude Lender from subsequently electing to exercise a different remedy, except as otherwise provided by law. The parties have agreed to the alternative remedies hereof specified in part because they recognize that the choice of remedies in the event of a failure hereunder will necessarily be and should properly be a matter of business judgment, which the passage of time and events may or may not prove to have been the best choice to maximize recovery by Lender at the lowest cost to Borrower. It is the intention of the parties that such choice by Lender be given conclusive effect regardless of such subsequent developments. At any sale of the security or collateral for the Loan or any part thereof whether by foreclosure or otherwise, Lender may in its discretion purchase all or any part of such collateral so sold or offered for sale for its own account and may apply against the balance due Lender pursuant to the terms of the Note the amount bid therefor.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE XII</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LEASES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.1 <U>Warranties Regarding Leases</U>. To induce Lender to execute and perform this Agreement, Borrower warrants and represents to Lender that all leases, tenancies, licenses or other similar agreements (</FONT>"<U><FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Leases</U></FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">) for use of any part of the Project are in full force and effect and Borrower is not aware of any defaults under any of the Leases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.2 <U>Agreements Regarding Leases</U>. At all times for so long as any part of the Loan remains unpaid:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) Borrower will not execute, terminate, cancel, amend, modify, assign or alter any Lease (for purposes of this Section 12.2, the defined term </FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Lease</FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT"> shall include any lease of any part of the Project executed after the date of this Agreement) without obtaining the approval of the Lender as to the terms, conditions, and provisions of any such Lease, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) Borrower will diligently perform all of its obligations under the Leases and will cause all tenants under the Leases to perform their obligations under the Leases. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) Borrower shall assign each executed lease of the Project to the Lender upon Lender's request.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) Borrower shall obtain Estoppel Letters and Subordination, Attornment and Non-Disturbance Agreements for each Lease requested by Lender in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE XIII</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MISCELLANEOUS</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.1 <U>Time Is of the Essence</U>. Lender and Borrower agree that time is of the essence with respect to all of their covenants under this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.2 <U>Prior Agreements</U>. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any other documents or instruments executed pursuant thereto or contemplated thereby, shall represent the entire, integrated agreement between the parties hereto with respect to construction and equipping of the Project, and shall supersede all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements pertaining thereto, either oral or written, other than the Commitment, which shall survive the execution of this Agreement by Borrower and Lender, and the occurrence of the Loan Closing, and shall be included in the term </FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT">Loan Documents.</FONT>"<FONT FACE="GoudyOlSt BT"> This Agreement and any provision hereof shall not be modified, amended, waived or discharged in any manner other than by a written amendment executed by all parties to this Agreement. An action on the part of the Lender waiving a specific provision or requirement herein contained, shall not be construed to be a waiver of future application of such provision or requirement or a waiver of any other provision or requirement hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.3 <U>Disclaimer by Lender</U>. Lender shall not be liable to any subcontractor, supplier, laborer, architect, engineer or any other party for services performed or materials supplied in connection with construction of the Project. Lender shall not be liable for any debts or claims accruing in favor of any such parties against Borrower or against the Land. The Borrower shall not be considered an agent of Lender for any purposes, and Lender is not a venture partner with Borrower. Lender shall not be deemed to be in privity of contract with any contractor, subcontractor or provider of services on or to the Land, nor shall any payment of funds directly to a Contractor, subcontractor or provider of services on or to the Land, be deemed to create any third party beneficiary status or recognition of same by Lender unless and until Lender expressly assumes such status in writing. Approvals granted by Lender for any matters covered under this Agreement shall be narrowly construed to cover only the parties and facts identified in any written approval or if not in writing such approvals shall be solely for the benefit of Borrower.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.4 <U>Indemnification</U>. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, defend and save harmless, Lender and its directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and all liability, expense or damage of any kind or nature and from any suits, claims, or demands, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of this Agreement or in connection herewith, except to the extent such suit, claim or damage is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender. This obligation on the part of Borrower shall survive the closing of the Loan, the repayment thereof and any cancellation of the Loan Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.5 <U>Captions</U>. The captions and headings of various articles and sections of this Agreement and exhibits pertaining hereto are for convenience only and not to be considered as defining or limiting in any way the scope or intent of the provisions hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.6 <U>Inconsistent Terms and Partial Invalidity</U>. In the event of any inconsistency among the terms hereof (including incorporated terms), or between such terms and the terms of any other Loan Document, this Loan Agreement shall be controlling. If any provision of this Agreement, or any paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or the application thereof, in any circumstances, is adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid part were never included herein.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.7 <U>Gender and Number</U>. Any word herein which is expressed in the masculine or neuter gender shall be deemed to include the masculine, feminine and neuter genders. Any word herein which is expressed in the singular or plural number shall be deemed, whenever appropriate in the context, to include the singular and plural.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.8 <U>Definitions Included in Amendments</U>. Definitions contained in this Agreement which identify documents, including, without limitation, the Loan Documents, shall be deemed to include all amendments and supplements to such documents from the date hereof, and all future amendments and supplements thereto entered into from time to time to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement or otherwise with the consent of the Lender. Reference to this Agreement contained in any of the foregoing documents shall be deemed to include all amendments and supplements to this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.9 <B><U>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</U>.</B> <B>BORROWER AND LENDER EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR RELATING THERETO OR ARISING FROM THE BANKING RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.10 <U>Notices</U>.
