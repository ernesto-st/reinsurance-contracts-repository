Election for any Base Rent Period shall also be considered the LIBOR Period Election in effect on (1)&nbsp;the Base Rent Commencement Date or Base Rent Date upon which such Base Rent Period begins

Periods until a new designation becomes effective in accordance with the provisions set forth in this definition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however: (1)&nbsp;Chiron shall not be entitled to

Parent and all other Participants to (1)&nbsp;a corresponding extension not only to the date for the expiration of the Term specified above, but also to the date specified in clause&nbsp;(3) of
the definition of Designated Sale Date, the Demand Deadline (and a corresponding extension of the Guaranty), and (2)&nbsp;an adjustment to the Rent that Chiron will be required to pay for the
extension, it being expected that the Rent for the extension may be different than the Rent required for the original Term, and it being understood that the Rent for any extension must in all events
be satisfactory to BNPLC (and all Participants) and Chiron, in their sole and absolute discretion; (B)&nbsp;no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of Chiron's exercise

of liability or loss of rights hereunder for being judged unreasonable. Accordingly, each of Chiron and BNPLC (and each Participant) hereby disclaim any obligation express or implied to be reasonable
in negotiating the Rent for any such extension. Subject to the changes to the Rent payable during any extension of the Term as provided in this Paragraph, if Chiron exercises its option to extend the
Term as provided in this Paragraph, the Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and the leasehold estate granted thereunder to Chiron shall continue without interruption and without any loss of

as provided in the next paragraph, any demand for payment made by BNPLC upon Guarantor under this Guaranty will constitute a demand made not only for BNPLC itself, but also on

Guaranty, the Banks may agree among themselves to each make a separate demand directly upon Guarantor. However, to be effective for purposes of this Guaranty, any such agreement by the Banks must be
in writing; must be provided to Guarantor before BNPLC makes a demand upon Guarantor for itself and for Participants; and must specify the respective amounts that BNPLC and each Participant will for
itself demand of Guarantor. Also, the total of all amounts specified in any such agreement as amounts that will be demanded of Guarantor must not exceed (before any addition required by the next
paragraph) Guarantor's maximum liability. If Guarantor receives an agreement among the Banks that satisfies the requirements set forth in the preceding sentences, Guarantor shall honor any separate
demands made by BNPLC and Participants in accordance with such agreement by making payments directly to BNPLC and Participants, rather than by making a single payment to BNPLC.

continuing security until no sum remains payable under the Lease and Purchase Agreements. Furthermore, these obligations of the Guarantor are additional to, and not instead of, any security or other
guarantee or indemnity at any time existing in favor of BNPLC, whether from the Guarantor or otherwise. The Guarantor irrevocably waives all notices and demands whatsoever. However, Guarantor shall
not have to make any payment requested for the first time after December&nbsp;31, 2009 by BNPLC (as provided in the last sentence of Paragraph&nbsp;1) or by BNPLC or Participants (as provided in

having discharged or diminished the liability of the Guarantor and this Guaranty will continue to apply as if such payment had at all times remained owning by Chiron.

Guarantor, present or future, including those in respect of deposits, but, in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings, only to the extent permitted by applicable

BNPLC's rights against Chiron and the right of recovery from Chiron. However, the Guarantor shall not by virtue of this Guaranty be entitled to the transfer of any rights of BNPLC or claim in
competition with BNPLC until all amounts which may be payable under the Lease and Purchase Agreements have been paid in full.

1999 amounting to USD $172,572,542.12, which will be returned to Novartis, AG. </FONT></DD></DL>
