                                   ARTICLE II.

                                   THE CREDITS

         SECTION 2.01 COMMITMENTS. Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Revolving
Lender agrees, severally and not jointly:

         (a) to make Revolving Loans to Borrower, at any time and from time to
time after the Closing Date until the earlier of one Business Day prior to the
Maturity Date and the termination

                                       46
<PAGE>

of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof,
in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not (subject
to provisions of Sections 10.10 and 10.11) result in such Lender's Revolving
Exposure exceeding the lesser of (A) such Lender's Revolving Commitment less
such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of any Line Reserve and (B) such Lender's Pro
Rata Percentage multiplied by the Borrowing Base then in effect.

         (b) Within the limits set forth in clause (a) above and subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, pay or
prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

         SECTION 2.02 LOANS. (a) Each Loan (other than Swingline Loans) shall be
made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with their applicable Commitments; provided, that the failure of any
Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to
be made by such other Lender). Except for Loans deemed made pursuant to Section
2.02(f), Loans (other than Swingline Loans) comprising any Borrowing shall be in
an aggregate principal amount that is (i) in the case of ABR Loans, integral
multiples of $1.0 million and not less than $5.0 million or (B) in the case of
Eurodollar Revolving Loans, an integral multiple of $1.0 million and not less
than $5.0 million or (ii) equal to the remaining available balance of the
applicable Revolving Commitments.

         (b) Subject to Sections 2.11 and 2.12, each Borrowing shall be
comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Loans as Borrower may
request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any
Eurodollar Revolving Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate
of such Lender to make such Loan; provided, that any exercise of such option
shall not affect the obligation of Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type may be
outstanding at the same time; provided further that Borrower shall not be
entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than six
Eurodollar Revolving Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any one time. For
purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods,
regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered
separate Borrowings.

         (c) Except with respect to Loans made pursuant to Section 2.02(f), each
Lender shall make each Loan (other than Swingline Loans) to be made by it
hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate
not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, and the Administrative Agent
shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an account as directed by
Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request maintained with the Administrative
Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition
precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so
received to the respective Lenders.

         (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such

                                       47
<PAGE>

Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (c) above, and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds
available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and Borrower severally agree
to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent
its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error). If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute
such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

         (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Borrower
shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Maturity Date.

         (f) If the Issuing Bank shall not have received from Borrower the
payment required to be made by Section 2.18(e) within the time specified in such
Section, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent of the LC Disbursement and the Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Revolving Lender of such LC Disbursement and its Pro Rata
Percentage thereof. Each Revolving Lender shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent on such date (or, if
such Revolving Lender shall have received such notice later than 12:00 (noon),
New York City time, on any day, not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time,
on the immediately following Business Day), an amount equal to such Lender's Pro
Rata Percentage of such LC Disbursement (it being understood that such amount
shall be deemed to constitute an ABR Revolving Loan of such Lender, and such
payment shall be deemed to have reduced the LC Exposure), and the Administrative
Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing
Bank any amounts received by it from Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(e) prior
to the time that any Revolving Lender makes any payment pursuant to this
paragraph (f); any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent thereafter
will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders
that shall have made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their interests
may appear. If any Revolving Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata Percentage
of such LC Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above,
such Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay interest on such amount, for
each day from and including the date such amount is required to be paid in
accordance with this paragraph (f) to but excluding the date such amount is
paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at (i) in
the case of Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to
Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06(a), and (ii) in the case of such
Lender, for the first such day, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and for each
day thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate.

         SECTION 2.03 BORROWING PROCEDURE. To request a Revolving Borrowing,
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone
(promptly confirmed by telecopy) (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New

                                       48
<PAGE>

York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or
(ii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, (other than Swingline Loans), not later
than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the proposed
Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent
of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
and signed by Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (a)      whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Revolving
         Borrowing or a Swingline Loan;

                  (b)      the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

                  (c)      the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
         Day;

                  (d)      whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
         Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing;

                  (e)      in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, the
         initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a
         period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period";
         provided, that until the earlier of (i) the date on which the
         Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have notified
         Borrower that the primary syndication of the Commitments has been
         completed and (ii) the date which is 180 days after the Closing Date,
         the Interest Period shall be one month;

                  (f)      the location and number of Borrower's account to
         which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
         requirements of Section 2.02; and

                  (g)      that the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (b)-(e)
         are satisfied as of the date of the notice.

         If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is
specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration (subject to the proviso in clause (e) above). Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the
Administrative Agent shall notify Collateral Agent of the borrowing Request,
confirm with Collateral Agent that the funding of such Borrowing Request is in
conformity with this Section 2.03 and advise each Lender of the details thereof
and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested
Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.04 EVIDENCE OF DEBT; REPAYMENT OF LOANS. (a) Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Revolving Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving
Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the
then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the
Maturity Date and the 10th day (or earlier, but, subject to application of funds
under Section 9.01(f), at least two Business Days) after such Swingline

                                       49
<PAGE>

Loan is made; provided, that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made,
Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the date such
Borrowing was requested.

         (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time under this Agreement.

         (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and Class thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto; (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower to each
Lender hereunder; and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
The Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, advise the Collateral Agent
of the status of such accounts to permit Collateral Agent to determine the
Borrowing Base.

         (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs
(b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of
the obligations therein recorded; provided, that the failure of any Lender or
the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall
not in any manner affect the obligations of Borrower to repay the Loans in
accordance with their terms.

         (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, Borrower shall prepare, execute
and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) in
the form of Exhibit H-1 or H-2, as the case may be. Thereafter, the Loans
evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

         (f) All funds in the Blocked Accounts (including the Concentration
Account) shall be applied to the Loans and other Obligations in accordance with
Section 9.01 hereof.

         SECTION 2.05 FEES. (a) Commitment Fee. Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee (a
"COMMITMENT FEE"), equal to the Applicable Fee per annum on the average daily
unused amount of each Commitment of such Lender during the period from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment
terminates. Accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day
of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the date hereof. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
Commitment Fees with respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of
a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving
Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender
shall be disregarded for such purpose).

                                       50
<PAGE>

         (b) Administrative Agent Fees; Collateral Agent Fees. Borrower agrees
to pay to the (i) the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the
administrative fees set forth in the Fee Letter or such other fees payable in
the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (the "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES") and (ii) (i) Collateral
Agent, for its own account, the collateral monitoring fee set forth in the Fee
Letter or such other fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
agreed upon between Borrower and the Collateral Agent (the "COLLATERAL AGENT
FEES").

         (c) LC and Fronting Fees. Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation
fee ("LC PARTICIPATION FEE") with respect to its participations in Letters of
Credit, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin from time to
time used to determine the interest rate on Eurodollar Revolving Loans pursuant
to Section 2.06 on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later
of the date on which such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and the date
on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing
Bank a fronting fee ("FRONTING FEE"), which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125%
per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion
thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to
be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to
the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
processing of drawings thereunder. LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date;
provided, that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within
10 days after demand. All LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
LC Participation Fee shall be increased to a per annum rate equal to 2% plus the
otherwise applicable rate with respect thereto.

         (d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate,
among the Lenders, except that the Fronting Fees shall be paid directly to the
Issuing Bank. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any
circumstances.

         SECTION 2.06 INTEREST ON LOANS AND DEFAULT COMPENSATION. (a) Subject to
the provisions of Section 2.06(c), the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing and
each Swingline Loan, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.

         (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), the Loans comprising
each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate

                                       51
<PAGE>

for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin
in effect from time to time.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, all Obligations shall, upon written
notice from the Administrative Agent, or at the election of the Required
Lenders, bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a per annum rate
equal to (i) in the case of principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise
applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section
2.06, (ii) LC Participation Fee shall increase as provided in Section 2.05(c),
and (iii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR
Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.06.

         (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Revolving
Commitments; provided, that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of
this Section 2.06 shall be payable on demand (provided, that, absent demand,
such interest shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date and upon
termination of the Revolving Commitments), (ii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior
to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the
principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period
therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date
of such conversion.

         (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate
Base Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and such determination shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.07 TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. (a) The
Revolving Commitments, the Swingline Commitment, and the LC Commitment shall
automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

         (b) Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
permanently reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided, that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an
integral multiple of $1.0 million and not less than $5.0 million, (ii) the
Commitments shall not be reduced to an amount less than $175.0 million and (iii)
the Commitments shall not be terminated or reduced if, after giving effect to
any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum
of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving
Commitments, the Swingline Exposures would exceed the Swingline Commitment or
the LC Exposures would exceed the LC Commitment.

         (c) Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to
terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.07 at
least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or
reduction, specifying such election and the effective

                                       52
<PAGE>

date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be irrevocable. Any termination or
reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of
the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.

         SECTION 2.08 INTEREST ELECTIONS. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially
shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the
case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period
as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, Borrower may elect to
convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in
the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.08. Borrower may elect different
options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which
case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the
Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion
shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Borrower shall not be entitled to request any conversion or
continuation that, if made, would result in more than six Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any one time. This Section 2.08 shall not
apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.

         (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.08, Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if Borrower was
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request substantially in the form of Exhibit D.

         (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (i)      the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses
(iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii)     the effective date of the election made pursuant to
such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
Borrowing or a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing; and

                  (iv)     if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
term "Interest Period"; provided, that until the earlier of (i) the date on
which the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have

                                       53
<PAGE>

notified Borrower that the primary syndication of the Commitments has been
completed and (ii) the date which is 180 days after the Closing Date, the
Interest Period shall be one month.

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing
but does not specify an Interest Period, then Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration (subject to the proviso in
clause (iv) above).

         (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

         (e) If an Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
request of the Required Lenders, so notifies Borrower, then, after the
occurrence and during the continuance of such Event of Default (i) no
outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.

         SECTION 2.09 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

         SECTION 2.10 OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS.

         (a) Optional Prepayments. In addition to prepayments of Borrowings in
accordance with Section 9.01 hereof, Borrower shall have the right at any time
and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, subject to
the requirements of this Section 2.10; provided, that each partial prepayment
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1.0 million and not less
than $5.0 million.

         (b) Revolving Loan Prepayments.

                  (i)      In the event of the termination of all the Revolving
Commitments, Borrower shall, on the date of such termination, repay or prepay
all its outstanding Revolving Borrowings and all outstanding Swingline Loans and
replace all outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an amount equal to the
LC Exposure in the Cash Collateral Account.

                  (ii)     In the event of any partial reduction of the
Revolving Commitments, then (A) at or prior to the effective date of such
reduction, the Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and the Revolving
Lenders of the sum of the Revolving Exposures after giving effect thereto and
(B) if the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of
Revolving Commitments after giving effect to such reduction, then Borrower
shall, on the date of such reduction, first, repay or prepay all Swingline
Loans, second, repay or prepay Revolving Borrowings and third, replace or cash
collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.18(j), in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                                       54
<PAGE>

                  (iii)    In the event that Excess Availability is less than
$15.0 million, the Borrower shall, without notice or demand, immediately apply
an amount equal to such deficiency to prepay the Loans and any interest accrued
thereon, in accordance with this Section 2.10(b)(iii). The Borrower shall,
first, repay or prepay Revolving Borrowings and second, replace or cash
collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.18(j), in an amount sufficient to restore such Excess
Availability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Overadvance made pursuant to
Section 10.10 shall be repaid only on demand in accordance with such Section.

                  (iv)     In the event that the sum of all Lenders' Revolving
Exposures exceeds the Revolving Commitments then in effect (including, without
limitation, on any date on which Dollar Equivalents are determined pursuant to
Section 11.15), the Borrower shall, without notice or demand, immediately first,
repay or prepay Revolving Borrowings and, second, replace or cash collateralize
outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.18(j), in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                  (v)      In the event that the aggregate LC Exposure exceeds
the LC Commitment then in effect (including, without limitation, on any date on
which Dollar Equivalents are determined pursuant to Section 11.15), the Borrower
shall, without notice or demand, immediately replace or cash collateralize
outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.18(j), in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

         (c) Asset Sales. Not later than one Business Day following the receipt
of any Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Loan Party, Borrower shall, and
shall cause the applicable Loan Party (with appropriate adjustments to any
intercompany loan account balances or Borrowing Base Guarantor Intercompany Loan
Account balances, as applicable) to, apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds
received with respect thereto to make prepayments in accordance with Section
2.10(i); provided, that:

                  (i)      no such prepayment shall be required with respect to
(A) any Asset Sale permitted by Section 6.05(b)(ii), (e) or (h), (B) the
disposition of assets subject to a condemnation or eminent domain proceeding or
insurance settlement to the extent it does not constitute a Casualty Event, or
(C) Asset Sales for fair market value resulting in no more than $100,000 in Net
Cash Proceeds per Asset Sale (or series of related Asset Sales) and less than
$1.0 million in Net Cash Proceeds in any fiscal year; and

                  (ii)     subject to Section 2.10(g) and so long as no Event of
Default shall then exist or would arise therefrom and the aggregate of such Net
Cash Proceeds of Asset Sales (except Asset Sales permitted under Section
6.05(b)(v)) shall not exceed $5.0 million in any fiscal year, such proceeds
shall not be required to be so applied on such date to the extent that Borrower
shall have delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Administrative Agent on or
prior to such date stating that such Net Cash Proceeds shall be used to purchase
replacement assets or acquire 100% of the Equity Interests of any Person that
owns such assets no later than 270 days following the date of such Asset Sale
(which Officers' Certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be
so expended); provided, that all Property purchased with the Net Cash Proceeds
thereof (other than such Property purchased by a Foreign Subsidiary in
connection with a Foreign Permitted Asset Sale) pursuant to this subsection
shall be made subject to the Lien of

                                       55
<PAGE>

the applicable Security Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent, for its
benefit and for the benefit of the other Secured Parties in accordance with
Sections 5.11 and 5.12;

         (d) Debt Issuance. Upon any Debt Issuance after the Closing Date (other
than Acquisition Debt Issuance), Borrower shall, and shall cause the other Loan
Parties to, make prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(i) in an aggregate
principal amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance.

         (e) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (f) Casualty Events. Not later than one Business Day following the
receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from a Casualty Event, Borrower shall apply,
and shall cause other Loan Parties (with appropriate adjustments to any
intercompany loan account balances or Borrowing Base Guarantor Intercompany Loan
Account balances, as applicable) to apply, an amount equal to 100% of such Net
Cash Proceeds to make prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(i); provided,
that subject to Section 2.10(g) and so long as no Event of Default shall then
exist or arise therefrom, such proceeds shall not be required to be so applied
on such date to the extent that in the event such Net Cash Proceeds shall not
exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate at any time, Borrower shall have delivered
an Officers' Certificate (which Officers' Certificate shall set forth the
estimates of the proceeds to be so expended) to the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent on or prior to such date stating that such proceeds shall be
used to repair, replace or restore any Property that is subject of a Casualty
Event no later than 270 days following the date of receipt of such proceeds;
provided, further, that all Property purchased with the Net Cash Proceeds
thereof pursuant to this subsection shall be made subject to the Lien of the
applicable Security Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent, for its benefit
and for the benefit of the other Secured Parties in accordance with Sections
5.11 and 5.12.

         (g) In the event that Borrower has delivered an Officers' Certificate
in accordance with Section 2.10(c)(ii) or in accordance with Section 2.10(f),
(i) both a Reserve and a Line Reserve ("REINVESTMENT RESERVE") shall be
established (in the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds less, in the case of a
Casualty Event, the Net Cash Proceeds attributable to lost or destroyed
Inventory) which shall each be released simultaneously with and to the extent of
any Loans advanced to the Borrower for the purpose of purchasing assets in
accordance with Section 2.10(c)(ii) or 2.10(f), as applicable; provided, that
Borrower submits (with the applicable Borrowing Request) an Officer's
Certificate setting forth the use of proceeds of the requested Loan and
confirming that such use is in compliance with Section 2.10(c)(ii) or 2.10(f),
as applicable, and (ii) in the event that any part or all of the Reinvestment
Reserve remains in place at the end of the time period set forth in Section
2.10(c)(ii) or 2.10(f), as applicable:

                  (A)      Borrower shall, and shall cause other Loan Parties to
         (with appropriate adjustments to any intercompany loan account balances
         or Borrowing Base Guarantor Intercompany Loan Account balances, as
         applicable) prepay Obligations in accordance (with a concurrent release
         of such Reinvestment Reserve) with Section 2.10(i) in the amount of
         such remaining Reinvestment Reserve without reducing Commitments, and

                  (B)      if such Reinvestment Reserve relates to Eligible
         Equipment or Eligible Real Property, (x) such Eligible Equipment or
         Eligible Real Property shall be deleted

                                       56
<PAGE>

         from Schedule 1.01(d) and Schedule 1.01(d) shall be amended in
         accordance with the definition of the term "Fixed Asset Loan Value"
         (with appropriate adjustments to the Borrowing Base Guarantor
         Intercompany Loan Account), and (y) the Fixed Asset Loan Value of the
         Person owning such Eligible Equipment or Eligible Real Property shall
         be reduced by an amount equal to the appraised net orderly liquidation
         value of Eligible Equipment or the appraised fair market value of
         Eligible Real Property, as applicable.

         For the purposes of determining whether clause (B) of this paragraph
(g) shall apply, any Equipment located on one of the locations listed on
Schedule 1.01(e) shall be deemed Eligible Equipment and therefore clause (B) of
this paragraph (g) shall apply with respect to such Equipment and the amount of
the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equipment shall be deemed to be the appraised net
orderly liquidation value thereof.

         (h) [Intentionally Omitted.]

         (i) Application of Prepayments.

                  (i)      Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of
Borrowings hereunder, Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be
prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment
pursuant to paragraph (i) of this Section 2.10(i). Subject to Section 9.04 and
so long as no Event of Default shall then exist and be continuing, all mandatory
prepayments shall be applied as follows: first, to Fees and reimbursable
expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent then due and
payable pursuant to the Loan Documents; second, to interest then due and payable
on all Loans; third, to the principal balance of the Swingline Loan until the
same has been repaid in full; fourth, to the outstanding principal balance of
Revolving Loans until the same has been paid in full, including accompanying
accrued interest and charges under Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.15 (Borrower may
elect which of any Eurodollar Revolving Borrowings is to be prepaid); fifth, to
cash collateralize all LC Exposures plus any accrued and unpaid Fees with
respect thereto (to be held and applied in accordance with Section 2.18(i)
hereof); sixth, to all other Obligations pro rata in accordance with the amounts
that such Lender certifies is outstanding; and, seventh, returned to Borrower or
to such party as otherwise required by law. All such mandatory prepayments of
the Revolving Loans shall cause a corresponding reduction in the Revolving
Commitments of the Lenders in accordance with their applicable Revolving
Commitments.

                  (ii)     Amounts to be applied pursuant to this Section 2.10
to the prepayment of Revolving Loans shall be applied, as applicable, first to
reduce outstanding ABR Revolving Loans, respectively. Any amounts remaining
after each such application shall be applied to prepay Eurodollar Revolving
Loans, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of any
prepayment of Loans required under this Section 2.10 shall be in excess of the
amount of the ABR Loans at the time outstanding, only the portion of the amount
of such prepayment as is equal to the amount of such outstanding ABR Loans shall
be immediately prepaid and, at the election of Borrower, the balance of such
required prepayment shall be prepaid immediately, together with any amounts
owing to the Lenders under Section 2.13.

         (j) Notice of Prepayment. Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender)
by telephone (confirmed by

                                       57
<PAGE>

telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a
Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment. Promptly following
receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline
Loans), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that
would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as
provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount
of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied
ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be
accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.06.

         SECTION 2.11 ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing:

         (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period; or

         (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included
in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone, e-mail or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter
and, until the Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be
ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.12 INCREASED COSTS. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBOR Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii)     impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Eurodollar Revolving Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
participation therein;

                                       58
<PAGE>

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Revolving Loan (or of maintaining
its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise),
then Borrower will pay to Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

         (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of
this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held
by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level
below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies
of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

         (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section 2.12 shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Borrower shall pay Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

         (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall not constitute a waiver
of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided, that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.12 for any increased costs or reductions
incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to
such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall not begin earlier than the date of
effectiveness of the Change in Law.

         SECTION 2.13 BREAKAGE PAYMENTS. In the event of (a) the payment or
prepayment, whether optional or mandatory, of any principal of any Eurodollar
Revolving Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable
thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of
any Eurodollar Revolving Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any
Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or
(d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto as

                                       59
<PAGE>

a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such
event, Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Loan, such
loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such
event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate that would have been applicable
to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the
then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits of a
comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar market. A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be delivered to
Borrower and Administrative Agent and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Borrower shall pay Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender the
amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt
thereof.

         SECTION 2.14 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF
SET-OFFs. (a) Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.12,
2.13 or 2.15, or otherwise) on or before the time expressly required hereunder
or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 677 Washington
Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut, except payments to be made directly to the
Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that
payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 and 11.03 shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of to the Persons entitled thereto and
payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent
shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other
Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any
payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business
Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be
payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document
shall be made in Dollars.

         (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC
Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest
and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal
and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.

                                       60
<PAGE>

         (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or
Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater
proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of
other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments
shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided, that (i) if
any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of
this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring
a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

         (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that Borrower
will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower
has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such
payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the
amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

         (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by
it pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.02(f), 2.14(d), 2.17(d), 2.18(d) or 11.03(d),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

         SECTION 2.15 TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of Borrower or any Borrowing Base Guarantor hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall be made without set-off, counterclaim or other defense
and free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all
Indemnified Taxes; provided, that if Borrower or such

                                       61
<PAGE>

Borrowing Base Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions or
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) the
Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or
withholdings been made, (ii) Borrower or such Borrowing Base Guarantor shall
make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) Borrower or such Borrowing Base
Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (b) In addition, Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (c) Borrower shall indemnify and pay the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 2.15) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing
Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority, Borrower shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.

         (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which Borrower
is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to
payments under this Agreement shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate. Each Foreign Lender either (1) (i) agrees to
furnish either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) and (ii) agrees (for the benefit
of Borrower and the Administrative Agent), to the extent it may lawfully do so
at such times, upon reasonable request by Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
to provide a new Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (or successor form) upon the
expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm any
complete exemption from, or any entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal
withholding tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder or (2) in the
case of any such Foreign Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (i) agrees to furnish either (a) a "Non-Bank

                                       62
<PAGE>

Certificate" in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
and two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN (or successor form) or (b) an Internal Revenue Form W-8ECI (or
successor form), certifying (in each case) to such Foreign Lender's legal
entitlement to an exemption or reduction from U.S. federal withholding tax with
respect to all interest payments hereunder and (ii) agrees (for the benefit of
Borrower and the Administrative Agent) to the extent it may lawfully do so at
such times, upon reasonable request by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to
provide a new Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or successor form) upon the expiration or
obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm any complete
exemption from, or any entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding
tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder.

         (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender (or an assignee) determines
in its reasonable discretion that it has received a refund of any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower or with
respect to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section
2.15, it shall pay over such refund to Borrower (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this
Section 2.15 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or the Other Taxes giving
rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender (or assignee) and without interest (other than any interest
paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided, however, that Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent
or such Lender (or assignee), agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrower
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or assignee)
in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or assignee) is required
to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in this
Section 2.15(f) shall require the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or
assignee) to make available its tax returns or any other information which it
deems confidential to Borrower or any other Person. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in no event will any Lender be required to pay any amount to
Borrower the payment of which would place such Lender in a less favorable net
after-tax position than such Lender would have been in had the additional
amounts giving rise to such refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes never
been paid in the first place.

         SECTION 2.16 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. (a)
Mitigation of Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under Section
2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or
any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.12 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

         (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.15, or if any Lender defaults in its

                                       63
<PAGE>

obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in Section 11.04), all of its interests, rights
and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee selected by Borrower that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided, that (i) Borrower shall have received the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline
Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender
shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in
the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such
assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease
to apply.

         SECTION 2.17 SWINGLINE LOANS. (a) Swingline Commitment. Subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make
Swingline Loans to Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Availability
Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not
result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans
exceeding $10.0 million or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Exposures
exceeding the lesser of (A) the total Revolving Commitments minus any
Reinvestment Reserve and (B) the Borrowing Base then in effect; provided, that
the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance
an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow
Swingline Loans.

         (b) Swingline Loans. To request a Swingline Loan, Borrower shall notify
the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy),
not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline
Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date
(which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The
Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such
notice received from Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline
Loan available to Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account
of Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made
to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section
2.18(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the requested date of such Swingline Loan. Borrower shall not request a
Swingline Loan if at the time of and immediately after giving effect to such
request a Default has occurred and is continuing. Swingline Loans shall be made
in minimum amounts of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 above such
amount.

         (c) Prepayment. Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time
to time to repay any Swingline Loan, in whole or in part, upon giving written or
telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written, or telecopy
notice) to the Swingline Lender and to the

                                       64
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent before 12:00 (noon), New York City time on the date of
repayment at the Swingline Lender's address for notices specified in the
Swingline Lender's Administrative Questionnaire. All principal payments of
Swingline Loans shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount
being repaid to the date of payment.

         (d) Participations. The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to
the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on any
Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such
Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice
shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders
will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent
will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice
such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each
Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of
notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loan
or Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever (provided, that such
payment shall not cause such Lender's Revolving Exposure to exceed such Lender's
Revolving Commitment). Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation
under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the
same manner as provided in Section 2.02(f) with respect to Loans made by such
Lender (and Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of any
participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and
thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the
Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by
the Swingline Lender from Borrower (or other party on behalf of Borrower) in
respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the
proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the
Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent
shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders
that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the
Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations
in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve Borrower of any
default in the payment thereof.

         SECTION 2.18 LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) General. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of
Credit for Borrower's account or the account of any Borrowing Base Guarantor in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank,
at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period
(provided, that Borrower shall be a co-applicant with respect to each Letter of
Credit issued for the account of or in favor of any Borrowing Base Guarantor).
In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit
application or other agreement submitted by Borrower to, or entered into by
Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall control. Issuing Bank may consent to issuing

                                       65
<PAGE>

Letters of Credit that have automatic extension or renewal provisions
("evergreen" Letters of Credit) in its sole discretion, which evergreen Letters
of Credit Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, elect not to permit to be
extended or renewed at any time. If, as of the date which is 60 days prior to
the Maturity Date, any evergreen Letters of Credit may for any reason remain
outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, Borrower shall immediately deposit
in the Cash Collateral Account, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, an amount in cash representing 105% of the
aggregate maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
in accordance with Section 9.04 hereof.

         (b) Request for Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit, Borrower shall hand
deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements
for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) an LC Request to the
Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on the third
Business Day preceding the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (or such later date and time as is acceptable to the Issuing Bank). A
request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit shall specify in form and
detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank: (i) the proposed issuance date of the
requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the amount
thereof; (iii) the expiry date thereof; (iv) the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in
case of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be
presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such
other matters as the Issuing Bank may require. A request for an amendment,
renewal or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit shall specify in form
and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (i) the Letter of Credit to be
amended, renewed or extended; (ii) the proposed date of amendment, renewal or
extension thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the nature of the
proposed amendment, renewal or extension; and (iv) such other matters as the
Issuing Bank may require. If requested by the Issuing Bank, Borrower also shall
submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in
connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be
issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit Borrower shall be deemed to
represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $50.0 million and (ii)
the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the total
Revolving Commitments minus the Line Reserve and (B) the Borrowing Base then in
effect. Unless the Issuing Bank shall agree otherwise, no Letter of Credit shall
be in an initial amount less than $100,000, in the case of a Commercial Letter
of Credit, or $500,000, in the case of a Standby Letter of Credit.

         (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) in the case of a Standby Letter of
Credit, (x) the date which is one year after the date of the issuance of such
Standby Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof,
one year after such renewal or extension) and (y) the Letter of Credit
Expiration Date and (ii) in the case of a Commercial Letter of Credit, (x) the
date that is 180 days after the date of issuance of such Commercial Letter of
Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, 180 days after such
renewal or extension) and (y) the Letter of Credit Expiration Date.

                                       66
<PAGE>

         (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such
Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank
and not reimbursed by Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of
this Section 2.18, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to
Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

         (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
by paying to the Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later
than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is
made, if Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to
11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been
received by Borrower prior to such time, on such date, then not later than 2:00
p.m., New York City time on (i) the Business Day that Borrower receives such
notice, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that
Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time
on the day of receipt; provided, that Borrower may, subject to the conditions to
borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.17 that
such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, Borrower's obligation to make
such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving
Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If Borrower fails to make such payment when due,
the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative
Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the
payment then due from Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Pro Rata
Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Percentage of the
unreimbursed LC Disbursement in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(f)
with respect to Loans made by such Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
payment from Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent
shall, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, distribute such payment to such Lenders
and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a
Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for
any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a
Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not
relieve Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                                       67
<PAGE>

         (f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of Borrower to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.18 shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section 2.18, constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of Borrower hereunder.
Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of
their Affiliates, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided, that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as
opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived
by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by Borrower that
are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise reasonable care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

         (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following
its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for
payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such
demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC
Disbursement thereunder; provided, that any failure to give or delay in giving
such notice shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the
Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement
(other than with respect to the timing of such reimbursement obligation set
forth in Section 2.18(e)).

         (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full
on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear
interest, for each day from and including the date

                                       68
<PAGE>

such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that Borrower reimburses
such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving
Loans; provided, that, if Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when
due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.18, then Section 2.06(c) shall
apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of
the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment
by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.18 to
reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent
of such payment.

         (i) Resignation or Removal of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may
resign as Issuing Bank hereunder at any time upon at least 30 days' prior notice
to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and Borrower. If the resigning Issuing
Bank is UBS, the successor Issuing Bank shall be Merrill Lynch Bank USA. The
Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing
Bank. One or more Lenders may be appointed as additional Issuing Banks in
accordance with subsection (k) below. The Administrative Agent shall notify the
Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank or any such additional
Issuing Bank. At the time any such resignation or replacement shall become
effective, Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the
replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c). From and after the effective
date of any such resignation or replacement or addition, as applicable, (i) the
successor or additional Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations
of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be
issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "ISSUING BANK" shall be
deemed to refer to such successor or such addition or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor or such additional Issuing Bank and all previous
Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the resignation or
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such resignation or replacement, but shall not be required to issue
additional Letters of Credit. If at any time there is more than one Issuing Bank
hereunder, Borrower may, in its discretion, select which Issuing Bank is to
issue any particular Letter of Credit.

         (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, on the Business Day that Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, Borrower shall deposit in the Cash Collateral
Account, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided, that the obligation to deposit
such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to Borrower described
in clause (g) or (h) of Article VIII. Each such deposit shall be held by the
Collateral Agent in a Cash Collateral Account pursuant to Section 9.04 as
collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of Borrower under
this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,
including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any
interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be
made at the option and sole discretion of the Collateral Agent and at the risk
and expense of Borrower,

                                       69
<PAGE>

such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has
been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC
Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to
satisfy other Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement. If Borrower is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount plus any accrued interest or
realized profits of such amounts (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall
be returned to Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default
have been cured or waived. If Borrower is required to provide an amount of such
collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b), such amount plus any accrued
interest or realized profits on account of such amount (to the extent not
applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to Borrower as and to the extent that,
after giving effect to such return, Borrower would remain in compliance with
Section 2.10(b) and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

         (k) Additional Issuing Banks. Borrower may, at any time and from time
to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or more additional Lenders
to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement. Any Lender
designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph (k) shall be deemed (in
addition to being a Lender) to be the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of
Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and all references herein and in
the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall, with respect to such
Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Lender in its capacity as Issuing
Bank, as the context shall require.

         (l) The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter
of Credit if:

                  (i)      any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the
Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to the
Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank
shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of
letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall
impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any
restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not
otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall
impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was
not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith
deems material to it; or

                  (ii)     the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate
one or more policies of the Issuing Bank.

         (m) The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter
of Credit if (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue
such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to
such Letter of Credit.

<PAGE>

invoice is subject to the Borrower's or Borrowing Base Guarantor', as
applicable, completion of further performance under such contract or is subject
to the equitable lien of a surety bond issuer;

                  (xi)     any Account with respect to which an invoice or other

are delivered on a bill-and-hold, cash-on-delivery basis or placed on
consignment (other than Eligible Consigned Inventory), guaranteed sale or other
terms by reason of which the payment by the Account Debtor is or may be
conditional or with respect to which the applicable Account Debtor is treated by
Borrower or a Borrowing Base Guarantor as a cash-in-advance terms customer
(regardless of whether shipment was in fact withheld subject to receiving
payment);

                  (xv)     any Account that is in default; provided, that,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an Account shall be deemed in
default upon the occurrence of any of the following:

                  limitations as the Collateral Agent may deem appropriate; it
                  being understood that as of the Closing Date, an Account of
                  AutoZone, Inc., Robert Bosch Corporation, Graybar Electric
                  Company, Inc. or State Electric Supply Co., Inc. which is due

<PAGE>

                  to its original terms of sale more than 90 days after its
                  original invoice date shall not be deemed in default by reason
                  of this clause (b) or by reason of clause (a) above, as long

applicable advance rate with respect to Eligible Inventory, in its reasonable
credit judgment, subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the
Supermajority Lenders in the case of adjustments, new criteria, changes in the

warehousemen if clause (iii) above has been complied with;

                  (vi)     is to be returned to suppliers;

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each Loan Party represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and each of the Lenders (with references
to the Companies being references thereto after giving effect to the
Transactions unless otherwise expressly stated) that:

                                       75
<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.01 ORGANIZATION; POWERS. Each Company (a) is duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b)
has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted
and to own and lease its Property and (c) is qualified and in good standing (to
the extent such concept is applicable in the applicable jurisdiction) to do
business in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.02 AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's powers and have
been duly authorized by all necessary action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each Loan Party and constitutes, and each other Loan
Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered
by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

         SECTION 3.03 GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.03, the Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval
of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental
Authority, except (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force
and effect, (ii) filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan
Documents and (iii) consents, approvals, registrations, filings or actions the
failure of which to obtain or perform could not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of any Company or any order of any Governmental
Authority, (c) will not violate, result in a default or require any consent or
approval under any applicable law or regulation, indenture, agreement or other
instrument binding upon any Company or its assets, or give rise to a right
thereunder to require any payment to be made by any Company, except for
violations, defaults or the creation of such rights that could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (d) will not result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any Property of any Company, except Liens
created under the Loan Documents and Permitted Liens.

         SECTION 3.04 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) Borrower has heretofore
furnished to the Lenders the consolidated balance sheets and related statements
of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of Holdings and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (i) as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000, 2001
and 2002, audited by and accompanied by the opinion of Deloitte & Touche LLP,
independent public accountants, and (y) as of and for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2003 and for the comparable period of the preceding fiscal
year, in each case, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Holdings. Such
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied and present fairly and accurately the financial condition and results of
operations and cash flows of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
such dates and for such periods. Except as set forth in such financial
statements or schedules hereto, as of the Closing Date, there are no liabilities
of any Company of any kind, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise, which if unpaid could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, and there is no existing condition,
situation or set of circumstances which could reasonably be expected to result

                                       76
<PAGE>

in such a liability, other than liabilities under the Loan Documents and the
Qualified Senior Note Documents.

         (b) Borrower has heretofore delivered to the Lenders Holdings' (i)
Confidential Information Memoranda, (ii) unaudited consolidated and
consolidating balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows as of and
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 and for the comparable period
of the preceding fiscal year and (iii) consolidated projections for a 5-year
period after the Closing Date. Such projections and financial statements have
been prepared in good faith by the Loan Parties, based on the assumptions stated
therein (which assumptions are believed by the Loan Parties on the date hereof
and on the Closing Date to be reasonable), are based on the best information
available to the Loan Parties as of the date of delivery thereof, accurately
reflect all adjustments required to be made to give effect to the Transactions.
The projections are based upon the same accounting principles as those used in
the preparation of the financial statements described above and the estimates
and assumptions stated therein, all of which the Loan Parties believes to be
reasonable and fair in light of current conditions and current facts known to
the Loan Parties and, as of the Closing Date, reflect the Loan Parties' good
faith and reasonable estimates of the future financial performance of the Loan
Parties for the period set forth therein. The projections are not a guaranty of
future performance, and actual results may differ from the projections.

         (c) Since December 31, 2002, there has been no event, change or
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.05 PROPERTIES. (a) Each Company has good title to, or valid
leasehold interests in, all its Property material to its business, except for
minor irregularities or deficiencies in title that, individually or in the
aggregate, do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as
currently conducted or to utilize such Property for its intended purpose. Title
to all such Property held by such Company is free and clear of all Liens except
for Permitted Liens. The Property of the Companies, taken as a whole, (i) is in
good operating order, condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted)
(except to the extent that the failure to be in such condition could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect) and (ii)
constitutes all the Property which is required for the business and operations
of the Companies as presently conducted.

         (b) Real Property. As of the Closing Date,

                  (i)      Schedule 3.05(b) contains a true and complete list of
each interest in Real Property owned by any Company and describes the type of
interest therein held by such Company. Schedule 3.05(b) contains a true and
complete list of each Real Property leased, subleased or otherwise occupied or
utilized by any Company, as lessee, sublessee, franchisee or licensee, and
describes the type of interest therein held by such Company and whether such
lease, sublease or other instrument requires the consent of the landlord
thereunder or other parties thereto to the Transactions.

                  (ii)     The Real Property and the current use thereof
complies in all material respects with (i) all applicable Requirements of Law
(including building and zoning ordinances

                                       77
<PAGE>

and codes), and the Borrower or the relevant Company is not an illegal user of
such Real Property, and (ii) all insurance requirements of this Agreement, in
each case, except where noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (iii)    No Casualty Event has been commenced or, to the best
knowledge of Borrower and the Companies, is contemplated with respect to all or
any portion of any material Real Property or for any materially adverse
relocation of roadways providing access to such Real Property other than a
Casualty Event relating to Real Property that has been restored, replaced or
rebuilt.

                  (iv)     There are no current, pending or, to the best
knowledge of Borrower and the Companies, proposed special or other assessments
for public improvements or otherwise affecting any Mortgaged Real Properties,
nor are there any contemplated improvements to such Mortgaged Real Properties
that may result in such special or other assessments, in each case, other than
such assessments that will be paid prior to delinquency.

                  (v)      Neither the Borrower nor the Companies have suffered,
permitted or initiated the joint assessment of any Mortgaged Real Property with
any other real property constituting a separate tax lot that would interfere
with the legal foreclosure of such Mortgaged Real Property independent of any
property that is not a Mortgaged Real Property. All owned Real Property is
comprised of one or more parcels, each of which or such parcels together
constitutes a separate tax lot and none of which constitutes a portion of any
other tax lot.

                  (vi)     Each of the Borrower and the Companies has obtained
all material permits (including assembly permits), licenses, variances and
certificates required by Requirements of Law to be obtained by such Person and
necessary to the use and operation of the Mortgaged Real Properties for the
purposes for which they are currently used. Each of the Borrower and the
Companies has obtained all permits (including assembly permits), licenses,
variances and certificates required by Requirements of Law to be obtained by
such Person and necessary to the use and operation of Real Property other than
Mortgaged Real Properties except to the extent that the failure to obtain such
permits, licenses, variances and certificates could not, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The use being made of
all Real Property is in material conformity with the certificate of occupancy
and/or such other permits, licenses, variances and certificates for such Real
Property and any other reciprocal easement agreements, restrictions, covenants
or conditions affecting such Real Property.

                  (vii)    Except for maintenance and repairs in the ordinary
course of business or as set forth on Schedule 3.05(b), to the best knowledge of
Borrower and the Companies, all Real Property owned by Loan Parties is free from
structural defects and all building systems contained therein are in good
working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, suitable for the
purposes for which they are currently being used.

                  (viii)   No Person other than the Companies has any possessory
interest in any Real Property or right to occupy any Real Property except for
leases, subleases and concessions (i) in the ordinary course of business and
(ii) on terms no less favorable to the Companies than terms that were available
to unaffiliated parties in the market generally at the time entered into.

                                       78
<PAGE>

There are no outstanding options to purchase or rights of first refusal or
restrictions on transferability affecting any owned Real Property.

                  (ix)     Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the affected Property, (i) all Real Property has
adequate rights of access to public ways to permit the Real Property to be used
for its intended purpose and is served by operating and adequate water,
electric, telephone, sewer, sanitary sewer and storm drain facilities, (ii) all
public utilities necessary to the continued use and enjoyment of the Real
Property and the Companies have the legal right to the continued use thereof,
(iii) all roads necessary for the full utilization of the Real Property for its
current purpose have been completed and dedicated to public use and accepted by
all Governmental Authorities or are the subject of access easements for the
benefit of such Real Property and (iv) all reciprocal easement agreements
affecting any Real Property are in full force and effect and no Company is aware
of any defaults thereunder. Except for public streets and sidewalks and other
non-material parcels in respect of which any further discontinuance of use or
occupying would not materially interfere with the value or utility of adjacent
or nearby Real Property, no Company uses or occupies any real property other
than such Real Property in connection with the use and operation of any Real
Property.

                  (x)      No building or structure constituting Real Property
or any appurtenance thereto or equipment thereon, or the use, operation or
maintenance thereof, violates any restrictive covenant or encroaches on any
easement or on any property owned by others, which violation or encroachment
materially interferes with the use or could materially adversely affect the
value of such building, structure or appurtenance or which encroachment is
necessary for the operation of the business at any Real Property. All buildings,
structures, appurtenances and equipment necessary for the use of each Mortgaged
Property for the purpose for which it is currently being used are located on the
real property encumbered by such Mortgage.

                  (xi)     Each parcel of Real Property, including each lease,
has adequate available parking to meet legal and operating requirements (after
taking into account reciprocal easement agreements and other easements on
adjoining or nearby land).

                  (xii)    No portion of the Real Property owned by a Loan Party
has suffered any material damage by fire or other material casualty loss that
has not heretofore been substantially repaired and restored to its original
condition. No portion of the Real Property owned by a Loan Party (other than the
Real Property located in Willimantic, Connecticut for which Borrower has flood
insurance) is located in a special flood hazard area as designated by any
federal governmental authorities.

         (c) Each Company owns, or is licensed to use, all patents, patent
applications, trademarks, trade names, servicemarks, copyrights, technology,
trade secrets, proprietary information, domain names, know-how and processes
necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted (the
"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"), except for those the failure to own or license which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been asserted and is pending by any
Person challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual Property or
the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor does any
Company know of any valid basis for any such claim (except for such claim and
infringement that could not reasonably be expected to result in a

                                       79
<PAGE>

Material Adverse Effect). The use of such Intellectual Property by each Company
does not infringe the rights of any Person, except for such claims and
infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) (i) No Company has received any notice of, nor has any knowledge
of, the occurrence or pendency or contemplation of any Casualty Event affecting
all or any portion of the Property and (ii) no Mortgage encumbers improved Real
Property that is located in an area that has been identified by the Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development as an area having special flood hazards and with
respect to which flood insurance has been made available under the National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968.

         SECTION 3.06 EQUITY INTERESTS AND SUBSIDIARIES. (a) Schedule 3.06(a)
sets forth a list of (i) all the Subsidiaries and their jurisdiction of
organization as of the Closing Date and (ii) the number of shares of each class
of its Equity Interests authorized, and the number outstanding (and the record
holder of such Equity Interests), on the Closing Date and the number of shares
covered by all outstanding options, warrants, rights of conversion or purchase
and similar rights at the Closing Date. All Equity Interests of each Company are
duly and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by
Holdings or Borrower, directly or indirectly through Wholly Owned Subsidiaries
and all Equity Interests of Borrower are owned directly by Intermediate Holdings
and all Equity Interests of Intermediate Holdings are owned directly by
Holdings. Each Loan Party is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good
and marketable title to, the Equity Interests pledged by it under the Security
Agreements and Foreign Pledge Agreements, free of any and all Liens, rights or
claims of other Persons, except the security interest created by the Security
Agreements, and there are no outstanding warrants, options or other rights to
purchase, or shareholder, voting trust or similar agreements outstanding with
respect to, or Property that is convertible into, or that requires the issuance
or sale of, any such Equity Interests.

         (b) No consent of any Person including any other general or limited
partner, any other member of a limited liability company, any other shareholder
or any other trust beneficiary is necessary or desirable in connection with the
creation, perfection or first priority status of the security interest of the
Collateral Agent in any Equity Interests pledged to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties under the Security Documents or the exercise by
the Collateral Agent of the voting or other rights provided for in the Security
Documents or the exercise of remedies in respect thereof.

         (c) An accurate organization chart, showing the ownership structure of
Holdings, Borrower and each Subsidiary on the Closing Date, and after giving
effect to the Transaction, is set forth on Schedule 3.06(c).

         SECTION 3.07 LITIGATION; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. (a) As of the Closing
Date, there are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or
before any Governmental Authority now pending or, to the knowledge of any
Company, threatened against or affecting any Company or any business, Property
or rights of any such Person (i) that involve any Loan Document or the
Transactions or (ii) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       80
<PAGE>

         (b) Except for matters covered by Section 3.17, no Company or any of
its Property is in violation of, nor will the continued operation of their
Property as currently conducted violate, any Requirements of Law (including any
zoning or building ordinance, code or approval or any building permits) or any
restrictions of record or agreements affecting the Real Property or is in
default with respect to any judgment, writ, injunction, decree or order of any
Governmental Authority, where such violation or default could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.08 AGREEMENTS. (a) No Company is a party to any agreement or
instrument or subject to any corporate or other constitutional restriction that
has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (b) No Company is in default in any manner under any provision of any
indenture or other agreement or instrument evidencing Indebtedness, or any other
agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
Property are or may be bound, where such default could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Schedule 3.08(c) accurately and completely lists all material
agreements (other than leases of Real Property set forth on Schedule 3.05(b) and
other than the Intercompany Agreements) to which any Company is a party which
are in effect on the date hereof in connection with the operation of the
business conducted thereby and Borrower has delivered to the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent complete and correct copies of all such material
agreements, including any amendments, supplements or modifications with respect
thereto.

         SECTION 3.09 FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS. (a) No Company is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of buying or carrying Margin Stock.

         (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan or any Letter of Credit will be
used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or
ultimately, for any purpose that entails a violation of, or that is inconsistent
with, the provisions of the regulations of the Board, including Regulation T, U
or X. The pledge of the Security Agreement Collateral pursuant to the Security
Agreements and Foreign Pledge Agreements does not violate such regulations.

         SECTION 3.10 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY
ACT. No Company is (a) an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (b) a "holding company," an
"affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         SECTION 3.11 USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower will used the proceeds of the
Revolving Loans on and after the Closing Date to effect the Refinancing, to
finance any Permitted Loan Funded Acquisition and for general corporate
purposes.

         SECTION 3.12 TAXES. Each Company has (a) timely filed or caused to be
timely filed all federal Tax Returns and all material, state, local and foreign
Tax Returns or materials

                                       81
<PAGE>

required to have been filed by it and all such Tax Returns are true and correct
in all material respects and has (b) duly and timely paid or caused to be duly
and timely paid all Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) due and
payable by it and all assessments received by it, except Taxes (i) that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which such
Company shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with
GAAP or (ii) which could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect; provided, that any such contest of Taxes with respect to
Collateral shall also satisfy the Contested Collateral Lien Conditions. Each
Company has made adequate provision in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes not
yet due and payable. Each Company is unaware of any proposed or pending tax
assessments, deficiencies or audits that could be reasonably expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.13 NO MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS. None of any information,
report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of
any Company to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
negotiation of any Loan Document or included therein or delivered pursuant
thereto (including the Confidential Information Memoranda) contained, contains
or will contain any material misstatement of fact or omission, omits or will
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were, are or will be made, not
misleading as of the date such information is dated or certified; provided, that
to the extent any such information, report, financial statement, exhibit or
schedule was based upon or constitutes a forecast or projection, each Loan Party
represents only that it acted in good faith and utilized reasonable assumptions
and due care in the preparation of such information, report, financial
statement, exhibit or schedule.

         SECTION 3.14 LABOR MATTERS. As of the date hereof and the Closing Date,
there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against any Company pending or, to
the knowledge of any Company, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made
to employees of any Company have not been in violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act or any other applicable federal, state, local or foreign law
dealing with such matters in any manner which could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. All payments due from any Company, or for
which any claim may be made against any Company, on account of wages and
employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or
accrued as a liability on the books of such Company except where the failure to
do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of
termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any
collective bargaining agreement to which any Company is bound.

         SECTION 3.15 SOLVENCY. Immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions to occur on the Closing Date and immediately following the making
of each Loan and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of each
Loan taking into account rights of contribution against or reimbursement from
other Loan Parties, (a) the fair value of the assets of each Loan Party
(individually and on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) will exceed its
debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present
fair saleable value of the Property of each Loan Party (individually and on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) will be greater than the amount that
will be required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other
liabilities become

                                       82
<PAGE>

absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party (individually and on a consolidated
basis with its Subsidiaries) will be able to pay its debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become
absolute and matured; and (d) each Loan Party (individually and on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) will not have unreasonably small
capital with which to conduct its business in which it is engaged as such
business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Closing
Date and (e) with respect to any Canadian Loan Party, that on such date (i) the
property of such Person is sufficient, if disposed of at a fairly conducted sale
under legal process, to enable payment of all its obligations, due and accruing
due, (ii) the property of such Person is, at a fair valuation, greater than the
total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such Person,
(iii) such Person has not ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary
course of business as they generally become due, and (iv)) such Person is not
for any reason unable to meet its obligations as they generally become due. In
determining the foregoing, the amount of contingent liabilities (such as
litigation, guaranties and pension plan liabilities) at any time shall be
computed as the amount that, in light of all the facts and circumstances
existing at the time, represents the amount that can be reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability.

         SECTION 3.16 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND PENSION PLANS. (a) Each Domestic
Company and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and
published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events, could reasonably be expected to result in material liability of any
Domestic Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or the imposition of a Lien on
any of the assets of a Domestic Company. As of the date of the most recent
financial statements, there is no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined by
Section 412(a) of the Code). Each Company and its ERISA Affiliates are in
compliance with the terms of the July 1999 agreement (and any amendments or
related letters) between Holdings and the PBGC that addresses the Plans. Using
actuarial assumptions and computation methods consistent with subpart 1 of
subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, the aggregate liabilities of each Company or
its ERISA Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans in the event of a complete
withdrawal therefrom, as of the close of the most recent fiscal year of each
such Multiemployer Plan, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16, the Canadian Pension Plans
are duly registered under the ITA and all other applicable laws which require
registration and no event has occurred which is reasonably likely to cause the
loss of such registered status. All material obligations of any Canadian Loan
Party (including fiduciary, funding, investment and administration obligations)
required to be performed in connection with the Canadian Pension Plans and the
funding agreements therefor have been performed in a timely fashion. There have
been no improper withdrawals or applications of the assets of the Canadian
Pension Plans or the Canadian Benefit Plans. There are no outstanding disputes
concerning the assets of the Canadian Pension Plans or the Canadian Benefit
Plans. Each of the Canadian Pension Plans is fully funded in accordance with the
contribution schedules determined by the Plan actuary (using actuarial methods
and assumptions which are consistent with the valuations last filed with the
applicable governmental authorities and which are consistent with generally
accepted actuarial principles). General Cable Canada does not employ any
employees outside of Canada.

                                       83
<PAGE>

         (c) Each Foreign Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance
with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable laws,
statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where required,
in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. No Foreign Company has
incurred any material obligation in connection with the termination of or
withdrawal from any Foreign Plan. Each Foreign Plan is funded in accordance with
the contribution schedule determined by the Plan actuary (using actuarial
methods and assumptions which are consistent with the valuations last filed with
the applicable Governmental Authority and which are consistent with generally
accepted actuarial principles). For each Foreign Plan which is not funded, the
obligations of such Foreign Plan are properly accrued.

Adverse Effect:

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
require any notification, registration, filing, reporting, disclosure,
investigation, remediation or cleanup pursuant to any Governmental Real Property
Disclosure Requirements or any other Environmental Law; and

                  (v)      The Companies have made available to Lenders all

properties.

correct description of all insurance maintained by each Company as of the

industry practice.

         SECTION 7.02 OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of the
Guarantors under Section 7.01 shall constitute a guaranty of payment and are
absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the
value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or any other
agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution,
release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
irrespective of any other circumstance

                                      125
<PAGE>

whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of a surety or Guarantor (except for payment in full). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or
more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors
hereunder which shall remain absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any
and all circumstances as described above:

                  (a)      the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability
         or any future amendment of, or change in, this Agreement, any other
         Loan Document or any other agreement, document or instrument to which
         Borrower is or may become a party;

                  (b)      the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement
         or any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent by Administrative
         Agent and Lenders with respect to any of the provisions thereof;

                  (c)      the existence, value or condition of, or failure to
         perfect its Lien against, any security for the Obligations or any
         action, or the absence of any action, by Administrative Agent and
         Lenders in respect thereof (including the release of any such
         security);

                  (d)      the insolvency of Borrower or any other Guarantor;

                  (e)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         the Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
         compliance shall be waived;

                  (f)      any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or
         instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted;

                  (g)      the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
         shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
         amended in any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents or any
         other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be
         amended or waived in any respect or any other guarantee of any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or
         exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (h)      any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor
         of, Issuing Bank or any Lender or Agent as security for any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected;

                  (i)      the release of Borrower or any other Guarantor; or

                  (j)      any other action or circumstances that might
         otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
         surety or guarantor (other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of
         all Obligations and the termination of all Commitments).

         The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that any Loan
Party thereof exhaust any

                                      126
<PAGE>

right, power or remedy or proceed against Borrower under this Agreement or the
Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or
therein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security
for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors waive any and all notice
of the creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured
Party upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, and the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created,
contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Guarantee, and all dealings between
Borrower and the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have
been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall be
construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of
payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations at any time or from time to time held by Secured Parties, and the
obligations and liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be conditioned
or contingent upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other Person at any
time of any right or remedy against Borrower or against any other Person which
may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of
offset with respect thereto. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and
effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the
Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the
benefit of the Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns,
notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement there
may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding.

         SECTION 7.03 REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of the Guarantors under
this Article VII shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of Borrower or other Loan Party in
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored
by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any
proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. The Guarantors jointly
and severally agree that they will indemnify each Secured Party on demand for
all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel)
incurred by such Secured Party in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law,
other than any costs or expenses resulting from the bad faith or willful
misconduct of such Secured Party.

         SECTION 7.04 SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION. Each Guarantor hereby agrees
that until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all
Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of
the Lenders under this Agreement it shall not exercise any right or remedy
arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 7.01,
whether by subrogation or otherwise, against Borrower or any other Guarantor of
any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed
Obligations. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any Indebtedness of
Borrower or any other Guarantor now or hereafter owing to any Guarantor or
Borrower by reason of any payment by such Guarantor under the Guarantee in this
Article VII is hereby subordinated to the prior indefeasible payment in full in
cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, any Indebtedness of the
Guarantors now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in
right of payment in full in cash to the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor
agrees that it will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such
Indebtedness of Borrower to such

                                      127
<PAGE>

Guarantor until the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in
cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Guarantor shall prior to
the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations collect,
enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such Indebtedness, such amounts
shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the
Secured Parties and be paid over to Administrative Agent on account of the
Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of such
Guarantor under the other provisions of the guaranty contained herein.

         SECTION 7.05 REMEDIES. The Guarantors jointly and severally agree that,
as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of Borrower under
this Agreement and the Notes, if any, may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Article XI (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Article XI)
for purposes of Section 7.01, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) as against Borrower and that, in the event of
such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically
due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by Borrower)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
7.01.

         SECTION 7.06 INSTRUMENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY. Each Guarantor hereby
acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article VII constitutes an instrument
for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or Agent, at
its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the payment of
any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a motion-action under
New York CPLR Section 3213.

         SECTION 7.07 CONTINUING GUARANTEE. The guarantee in this Article VII is
a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations
whenever arising.

         SECTION 7.08 GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. In any action
or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or
foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights
of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 7.01
would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account
of the amount of its liability under Section 7.01, then, notwithstanding any
other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any
further action by such Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other Person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and
enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined
in such action or proceeding.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

         In case of the happening of any of the following events ("EVENTS OF
DEFAULT"):

                  (a)      default shall be made in the payment of any principal
         of any Loan or the reimbursement with respect to any LC Disbursement
         when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the due
         date thereof or at a date fixed for prepayment thereof or by
         acceleration thereof or otherwise;

                  (b)      default shall be made in the payment of any interest
         on any Loan or any Fee or any other amount (other than an amount
         referred to in (a) above) due under any Loan Document, when and as the
         same shall become due and payable, and such default shall continue
         unremedied for a period of three Business Days;

                  (c)      any representation or warranty made or deemed made in
         or in connection with any Loan Document or the borrowings or issuances
         of Letters of Credit hereunder, or any representation, warranty,
         statement or information contained in any report, certificate,
         financial statement or other instrument furnished in connection with or
         pursuant to any Loan Document, shall prove to have been false or
         misleading in any material respect when so made, deemed made or
         furnished; it being recognized by Lenders, however, that projections as
         to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that the actual
         results during the period or periods covered by said projections may
         differ from the projected results;

                  (d)      default shall be made in the due observance or
         performance by any Company of any covenant, condition or agreement
         contained in Section 5.02, 5.03, 5.08, 5.16 or in Article VI;

                  (e)      default shall be made in the due observance or
         performance by any Company of any covenant, condition or agreement
         contained in Section 5.01 or 5.15 and such default shall continue
         unremedied or shall not be waived for a period of 5 days;

                  (f)      default shall be made in the due observance or
         performance by any Company of any covenant, condition or agreement
         contained in any Loan Document (other than those specified in
         paragraphs (a), (b), (d) or (e) above) and such default shall continue
         unremedied or shall not be waived for a period of 20 days after written
         notice thereof from the Administrative Agent or any Lender to Borrower;

                  (g)      any Company shall (i) fail to pay any principal or
         interest, regardless of amount, due in respect of any Indebtedness
         (other than the Obligations), when and as the same shall become due and
         payable, or (ii) fail to observe or perform any other term, covenant,
         condition or agreement contained in any agreement or instrument
         evidencing or governing any such Indebtedness if the effect of any
         failure referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) is to cause, or to permit
         the holder or holders of such Indebtedness or a trustee on its or their
         behalf (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or
         both) to cause, such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated
         maturity; provided, that it shall not

                                      129
<PAGE>

         constitute an Event of Default pursuant to this paragraph (f) unless
         the aggregate amount of all such Indebtedness referred to in clauses
         (i) and (ii) exceeds $100,000 at any one time;

                  (h)      an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an
         involuntary petition shall be filed in a court of competent
         jurisdiction seeking (i) relief in respect of any Domestic or Canadian
         Company (other than any Domestic or Canadian Company which is an
         Inactive Company and with respect to which the book value of its
         tangible assets does not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $3.0 million)
         or any Foreign Company with respect to which the book value of its
         tangible assets exceeds the Dollar Equivalent of $3.0 million, or of a
         substantial part of the Property or assets of any Company, under Title
         11 of the United States Code, as now constituted or hereafter amended,

         insolvency, receivership or similar law; (ii) the appointment of a
         receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar
         official for any such Company or for a substantial part of the Property

         of any such Company; and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition
         shall continue undismissed for 60 days or an order or decree approving
         or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered;

                  (i)      any Domestic or Canadian Company or any Foreign
         Company with respect to which the book value of its tangible assets
         exceeds the Dollar Equivalent of $3.0 million shall (i) voluntarily
         commence any proceeding or file any petition seeking relief under Title

         or any other federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency,
         receivership or similar law; (ii) consent to the institution of, or
         fail to contest in a timely and appropriate manner, any proceeding or
         the filing of any petition described in (g) above; (iii) apply for or
         consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian,
         sequestrator, conservator or similar official for any such Company or
         for a substantial part of the Property or assets of any such Company;
         (iv) file an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition
         filed against it in any such proceeding; (v) make a general assignment

         wind up or liquidate;

                  (j)      one or more judgments for the payment of money in an
         aggregate amount in excess of $1.0 million shall be rendered against
         any Company or any combination thereof and the same shall remain
         undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which execution
         shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken
         by a judgment creditor to levy upon assets or properties of any Company
         to enforce any such judgment;

                  (k)      an ERISA Event or noncompliance with respect to
         Foreign Plans shall have occurred that, in the reasonable opinion of
         the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other such ERISA
         Events and noncompliance with respect to Foreign Plans that have
         occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in liability of any
         Domestic or Canadian Company and its ERISA Affiliates in an aggregate
         amount exceeding $500,000 or the imposition of a Lien on any assets of
         a Company;

<PAGE>

                  (l)      any security interest and Lien purported to be
         created by any Security Document shall cease to be in full force and
         effect, or shall cease to give the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of
         the Secured Parties, the Liens, rights, powers and privileges purported
         to be created and granted under such Security Documents (including a
         perfected first priority security interest in and Lien on, all of the
         Collateral thereunder (except as otherwise expressly provided in such
         Security Document)) in favor of the Collateral Agent, or shall be
         asserted by Borrower or any other Loan Party not to be, a valid,
         perfected, first priority (except as otherwise expressly provided in
         this Agreement or such Security Document) security interest in or Lien
         on the Collateral covered thereby;

                  (m)      the Guarantees shall cease to be in full force and
         effect, unless in connection with the sale, merger or dissolution of a
         Guarantor to the extent permitted under Section 6.05 hereof;

                  (n)      any Loan Document or any material provisions thereof
         shall at any time and for any reason be declared by a court of
         competent jurisdiction to be null and void, or a proceeding shall be
         commenced by any Loan Party or any other Person, or by any Governmental
         Authority, seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability
         thereof (exclusive of questions of interpretation of any provision
         thereof), or any Loan Party shall repudiate or deny that it has any
         liability or obligation for the payment of principal or interest or
         other obligations purported to be created under any Loan Document;

                  (o)      there shall have occurred a Change in Control;

                  (p)      any Loan Party shall be prohibited or otherwise
         restrained from conducting the business theretofore conducted by it in
         any manner that has or could reasonably be expected to result in a
         Material Adverse Effect by virtue of any determination, ruling,
         decision, decree or order of any court or Governmental Authority of
         competent jurisdiction; or

                  (q)      the indictment by any Governmental Authority of any
         Loan Party as to which any Loan Party or Administrative Agent receives
         notice as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
         determination, in the good faith determination of Administrative Agent,
         under any criminal statute, or commencement of criminal or civil
         proceedings against any Loan Party pursuant to which statute or
         proceedings the penalties or remedies sought or available include
         forfeiture of (i) any of the Collateral having a value in excess of
         $1.0 million or (ii) any other Property of any Loan Party which is
         necessary or material to the conduct of its business;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to Holdings or
Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to
Borrower, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different
times: (i) terminate forthwith the Commitments and (ii) declare the Loans then
outstanding to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon the
principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued
interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of
Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan

                                      131
<PAGE>

Document, shall become forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by Borrower and the Guarantors, anything contained herein or in any other
Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding; and in any event with respect to
Holdings or Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above, the Commitments
shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding,
together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other
liabilities of Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document,
shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest
or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
Borrower and the Guarantors, anything contained herein or in any other Loan
Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

          COLLATERAL MATTERS; CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS; APPLICATION OF
                               COLLATERAL PROCEEDS

         SECTION 9.01 ACCOUNTS AND ACCOUNT COLLECTIONS.

         (a) Borrower and each Borrowing Base Guarantor shall notify Collateral
Agent promptly of: (i) any material delay in the performance by Borrower or any
Borrowing Base Guarantor of any of their material obligations to any Account
Debtor or the assertion of any material claims, offsets, defenses or
counterclaims by any Account Debtor, or any material disputes with Account
Debtors, or any settlement, adjustment or compromise thereof, (ii) all material
adverse information known to any Loan Party relating to the financial condition
of any Account Debtor and (iii) any event or circumstance which, to any Loan
Party's knowledge, would result in any Account no longer constituting an
Eligible Account. Borrower and each Borrowing Base Guarantor hereby agree not to
grant to any Account Debtor any credit, discount, allowance or extension, or to
enter into any agreement for any of the foregoing, without Collateral Agent's
consent, except in the ordinary course of business in accordance with practices
and policies previously disclosed in writing to Collateral Agent. So long as no
Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, Borrower and each
Borrowing Base Guarantor may settle, adjust or compromise any claim, offset,
counterclaim or dispute with any Account Debtor. At any time that an Event of
Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, Collateral Agent shall, at its
option, have the exclusive right to settle, adjust or compromise any claim,
offset, counterclaim or dispute with Account Debtors of any Loan Party or grant
any credits, discounts or allowances.

         (b) With respect to each Account: (i) the amounts shown on any invoice
delivered to Collateral Agent or schedule thereof delivered to Collateral Agent
shall be true and complete in all material respects, (ii) no payments shall be
made thereon except payments immediately delivered to Collateral Agent pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or any applicable Security Document (to the
extent so required), (iii) there shall be no setoffs, deductions, contras,
defenses, counterclaims or disputes existing or asserted with respect thereto
except as reported to Collateral Agent and promptly reflected in the reporting
of the Borrowing Base, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (iv)
none of the transactions giving rise thereto will violate any applicable laws or
regulations, all documentation relating thereto will be legally sufficient under
such laws and regulations and all such documentation will be legally enforceable
in accordance with its terms.

                                      132
<PAGE>

         (c) Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time or times, in
Collateral Agent's name or in the name of a nominee of Collateral Agent, to
verify the validity, amount or any other matter relating to any Account or other
Collateral, by mail, telephone, e-mail, facsimile transmission or otherwise. To
facilitate the exercise of the right described in the immediately preceding
sentence, Borrower hereby agrees to provide Collateral Agent upon request the
name and address of each Account Debtor of Borrower or any Borrowing Base
Guarantor.

         (d) Borrower shall establish and maintain, at its sole expense, and
shall cause each Guarantor to establish and maintain, at its sole expense
blocked accounts or lockboxes and related deposit accounts (collectively, the
"BLOCKED ACCOUNTS"), as Collateral Agent may specify, with such banks as are
acceptable to Collateral Agent into which Borrower and Guarantors shall promptly
deposit and direct their respective Account Debtors to directly remit all
payments on Accounts and all payments constituting proceeds of Inventory or
other Collateral (other than proceeds of a Casualty Event or Asset Sales that do
not require a permanent repayment under Loan Documents) in the identical form in
which such payments are made, whether by cash, check or other manner and shall
be identified and segregated from all other funds of the Loan Parties. Borrower
and Guarantors shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Collateral Agent a
Deposit Account Control Agreement duly authorized, executed and delivered by
each bank where a Blocked Account for the benefit of Borrower or any Guarantor
is maintained, and by each bank where any other deposit account is from time to
time maintained. Borrower shall further execute and deliver, and shall cause
each Guarantor to execute and deliver, such agreements and documents as
Collateral Agent may require in connection with such Blocked Accounts and such
Deposit Account Control Agreements. Except as permitted by Section 9.01(e)(iii),
Borrower and Guarantors shall not establish any deposit accounts after the
Closing Date, unless Borrower or Guarantor (as applicable) have complied in full
with the provisions of this Section 9.01 with respect to such deposit accounts.
Borrower agrees that all payments made to such Blocked Accounts or other funds
received and collected by Collateral Agent or any Lender, whether in respect of
the Accounts, as proceeds of Inventory or other Collateral or otherwise shall be
treated as payments to Collateral Agent and Lenders in respect of the
Obligations and therefore shall constitute the property of Collateral Agent and
Lenders to the extent of the then outstanding Obligations.

         (e) The Borrower and each Guarantor shall maintain a cash management
system which is acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
(the "CASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"). The Cash Management System shall contain, among
other things, the following:

                  (i)      With respect to the Blocked Accounts of Borrower and
such Guarantors as the Collateral Agent shall determine in its sole discretion,
the applicable bank maintaining such Blocked Accounts shall agree, pursuant to
the applicable Deposit Account Control Agreement, to forward daily all amounts
in each Blocked Account to one Blocked Account designated as concentration
account in the name of Borrower (the "CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT") at the bank that
shall be designated as the Concentration Account bank for Borrower (the
"CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT BANK"), which, on the Closing Date, shall be account
#4005296793 maintained by PNC Bank, National Association. The Concentration
Account Bank shall agree, pursuant to the applicable Deposit Account Control
Agreement, to forward daily all amounts in the Concentration Account to the
account designated as collection account (the "COLLECTION ACCOUNT") which shall
be under the exclusive dominion and control of the Collateral Agent;

                                      133
<PAGE>

                  (ii)     With respect to the Blocked Accounts of such
Guarantors as the Collateral Agent shall determine in its sole discretion, the
applicable bank maintaining such Blocked Accounts shall agree, from and after
the receipt of a notice (an "ACTIVATION NOTICE") from the Collateral Agent
(which Activation Notice may be given by Collateral Agent at any time in its
discretion), to forward all amounts in each Blocked Account to the applicable
Collection Account and to commence the process of daily sweeps from such Blocked
Account into the Collection Account;

                  (iii)    Borrower may maintain, in its name, an account or
accounts at a bank reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent, into which
Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, deposit proceeds of Revolving
Loans and Swingline Loans made to Borrower hereunder and which bank shall agree,
pursuant to Deposit Account Control Agreement relative to such disbursement
account, from and after the receipt of a notice from the Collateral Agent (which
notice may be given by Collateral Agent at any time an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing) to forward all amounts in each Blocked Account to the
applicable Collection Account. Any provision of this Section 9.01 to the
contrary notwithstanding, (A) Loan Parties may maintain payroll accounts and
trust accounts that are not a part of the Cash Management Systems provided that
no Loan Party shall accumulate or maintain cash in such accounts and the
disbursement account(s) described in the preceding sentence as of any date of
determination in excess of checks outstanding against such accounts as of that
date and amounts necessary to meet minimum balance requirements and (B) Loan
Parties may maintain local cash accounts that are not a part of the Cash
Management Systems which individually do not at any time contain funds in excess
of $100,000 and, together with all other such local cash accounts, do not exceed
$1.0 million.

         (f) The Administrative Agent shall apply all funds received in the
Collection Account on a daily basis to the repayment (by transferring same to
the account of or pursuant to direction of Administrative Agent) of (i) first,
Fees and reimbursable expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent then due and payable; (ii) second, to interest then due and payable on all
Loans, (iii) third, Overadvances, (iv) fourth, the Swingline Loans, (v) fifth,
ABR Revolving Loans, (vi) sixth, Eurodollar Revolving Loans, together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon (excluding Eurodollar Revolving Loans (A)
with respect to which the application of such payment would result in the
payment of the principal prior to the last day of the relevant Interest Period
and (B) which Borrower elects to continue pursuant to Section 2.08(b)), and
(vii) last, other amounts which are due, in each case without a reduction in the
Commitments; all further funds received in any of the Collection Account shall,
unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, be transferred or
applied by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the directions of Borrower or
the respective other Loan Party. If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Administrative Agent shall not transfer or apply any such funds
from the Collection Account in accordance with such directions unless the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent determine to release such funds to
Borrower. Absent any such determination by the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent, all such funds in the Collection Account shall be transferred
to the Cash Collateral Account to be applied to the Eurodollar Revolving Loans
on the last day of the relevant Interest Period of such Eurodollar Revolving
Loan or to the Obligations as they come due (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise). If consented to by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders, such funds in the Cash Collateral
Account may be released to Borrower.

                                      134
<PAGE>

         (g) Borrower and its directors, employees, agents and other Affiliates
and Borrowing Base Guarantors shall, acting as trustee for Collateral Agent,
receive, as the property of Collateral Agent, any monies, checks, notes, drafts
or any other payment relating to and/or proceeds of Accounts, Inventory or other
Collateral which come into their possession or under their control and
immediately upon receipt thereof, shall deposit or cause the same to be
deposited in the Blocked Accounts, or remit the same or cause the same to be
remitted, in kind, to Collateral Agent. In no event shall the same be commingled
with Borrower's own funds. Borrower agrees to reimburse Collateral Agent on
demand for any amounts owed or paid to any bank at which a Blocked Account is
established or any other bank or Person involved in the transfer of funds to or
from the Blocked Accounts arising out of Collateral Agent's payments to or
indemnification of such bank or Person.

         (h) With respect to the accounts #4005296996 and #4005297008 maintained
at PNC Bank, National Association, Loan Parties represent and warrant that no
more than $2,500 in the aggregate is on deposit therein and covenant and agree
that no Loan Party shall deposit or suffer to be deposited therein any funds,
and Loan Parties shall terminate such accounts no later than December 24, 2003,
on or before which date Borrower agrees to deliver to the Administrative Agent
evidence of such termination.

         SECTION 9.02 INVENTORY; FIELD AUDITS AND APPRAISALS. With respect to
the Inventory: (a) Borrower and Borrowing Base Guarantors shall at all times
maintain records of Inventory reasonably satisfactory to Collateral Agent,
keeping correct and accurate records itemizing and describing the kind, type,
quality and quantity of Inventory, the cost therefor and daily withdrawals
therefrom and additions thereto; (b) any of the Administrative Agent's and
Collateral Agent's officers, employees or agents shall have the right, at any
time or times, in the name of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, any designee of the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or
Borrower, to verify the validity, amount or any other matter relating to
Accounts or Inventory by mail, telephone, electronic communication, personal
inspection or otherwise and to conduct field audits of the financial affairs and
Collateral of the Loan Parties, and Borrower shall cooperate fully with the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent in an effort to facilitate and
promptly conclude any such verification process; (c) the Loan Parties shall
cooperate fully with the Collateral Agent and its agents during all Collateral
field audits and Inventory Appraisals which shall be at the expense of Borrower
and which shall be conducted no more frequently than quarterly, or, following
the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, more
frequently at Collateral Agent's request; (d) neither Borrower nor any Borrowing
Base Guarantor shall sell Inventory to any customer on approval, or any other
basis which entitles the customer to return (except for the right of customers
for Inventory which is defective or non-conforming) or may obligate any Loan
Party to repurchase such Inventory; and (e) Borrower Borrowing Base Guarantor
shall keep the Inventory in good and marketable condition.

         SECTION 9.03 EQUIPMENT, REAL PROPERTY AND APPRAISALS.

         With respect to the Equipment and owned Real Property: (a) upon the
Collateral Agent's request, Borrower shall, at its expense, no more than one (1)

any time or times as the Collateral Agent may request following the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, deliver or

                                      135
<PAGE>

cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent written appraisals as to the
Equipment and/or the owned Real Property by an independent appraiser designated
by the Collateral Agent and reasonably acceptable to Borrower, (b) Borrower and
each Borrowing Base Guarantor shall notify Collateral Agent promptly of any
event or circumstance which, to any Loan Party's knowledge, would result in any
Equipment no longer constituting an Eligible Equipment and (c) Borrower and each
Borrowing Base Guarantor shall notify Collateral Agent promptly of any event or
circumstance which, to any Loan Party's knowledge, would result in any Real
Property no longer constituting an Eligible Real Property.

         SECTION 9.04 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.

         (a) The Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to establish and maintain
at its office at 222 North LaSalle Street, 16th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60601,
in the name of the Collateral Agent and pursuant to a dominion and control
Agreement, one or more restricted deposit account designated as a "CASH
COLLATERAL ACCOUNT" bearing the name of the owners of the funds contained
therein (e.g., General Cable Industries Inc. - Cash Collateral Account). Each
Loan Party shall deposit into its respective Cash Collateral Account from time
to time the cash collateral required to be deposited under Section 2.18(j) or
Section 9.01(f) hereof.

         (b) The balance from time to time in such Cash Collateral Accounts
shall constitute part of the Collateral and shall not constitute payment of the
Obligations until applied as hereinafter provided. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof to the contrary, all amounts held in the Cash Collateral
Accounts shall constitute collateral security (i) first for the liabilities in
respect of Letters of Credit outstanding from time to time and second for the
other Obligations hereunder until such time as all Letters of Credit shall have
been terminated and all of the liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit have
been paid in full, and (ii) if held in Cash Collateral Account pursuant to
Section 9.01(f), then for the Obligations as provided therein.

         SECTION 9.05 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds received by the
Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or other realization
upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by the
Collateral Agent of its remedies shall be applied, together with any other sums

Collateral Agent as follows (with, in the case of proceeds from a Borrowing Base
Guarantor, a corresponding reduction in the Borrowing Base Guarantor
Intercompany Loan Account):

                  (a)      First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
         expenses, fees, commissions and taxes of such sale, collection or other
         realization including, without limitation, compensation to the
         Collateral Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses,
         liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent in
         connection therewith, together with interest on each such amount at the
         highest rate then in effect under this Agreement from and after the
         date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;

                  (b)      Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs
         and expenses of such sale, collection or other realization including,
         without limitation, costs and expenses and all costs, liabilities and

                                      136
<PAGE>

         connection therewith, together with interest on each such amount at the
         highest rate then in effect under this Agreement from and after the
         date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;

                  (c)      Third, without duplication of amounts applied
         pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above, to the indefeasible payment
         in full in cash, of each Lender's Default Allocation Percentage of
         interest, principal and other amounts constituting Obligations, equally
         and ratably in accordance with each Lender's Default Allocation
         Percentage of such amounts; and

                  (d)      Fourth, the balance, if any, to the Person lawfully
         entitled thereto (including the applicable Loan Party or its successors
         or assigns).

         In the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to pay in full the
items described in clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 9.02, the Loan
Parties shall remain liable for any deficiency.

                                   ARTICLE X.

                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

         SECTION 10.01 APPOINTMENT. (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably
designates and appoints UBS as the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, and each Lender irrevocably authorizes UBS, in its
capacity as the Administrative Agent, to take such actions on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise
such powers as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

         (b) Each Secured Party hereby irrevocably designates and appoints
Merrill as the Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, and each Lender irrevocably authorizes Merrill its capacity as the
Collateral Agent, to take such actions on its behalf under the provisions of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers as are
expressly delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Except as otherwise provided herein, Collateral
Agent shall hold all Collateral and all payments of principal, interest, fees,
charges and expenses received pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents for the benefit of Secured Parties and shall enforce the rights in the
Collateral on behalf of the Secured Parties. Without limiting any of the
foregoing, for the purposes of holding any security granted by any Loan Party
pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec, the Collateral Agent shall be
the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (fonde de pouvoir) (within the
meaning of the Civil Code of Quebec) for all present and future Secured Parties
and in particular for all present and future holders of the bond(s) issued by
any Loan Party in favor of the Collateral Agent (the "BOND"). The Collateral
Agent is hereby appointed by each of the Secured Parties to act as the Person
holding an irrevocable power of attorney (fonde de pouvoir) pursuant to article
2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec in order to hold security granted by a Loan
Party in the Province of Quebec to secure a Bond. By

                                      137
<PAGE>

executing an Assignment and Acceptance, each future Secured Party shall be
deemed to ratify the constitution of the Collateral Agent as the holder of the
irrevocable power of attorney (fonde de pouvoir) granted herein. Each party
hereto agrees that, notwithstanding Section 32 of an Act respecting the Special
Powers of Legal Persons (Quebec), Collateral Agent may, as the Person holding
the power of attorney of the Secured Parties, acquire and/or be holder of the
Bond.

         (c) Each Secured Party authorizes and directs the Collateral Agent to
enter into the Security Documents and other Loan Documents for the benefit of
Secured Parties. The Collateral Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of all
Secured Parties, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from
any Secured Party to take any action with respect to any Collateral or the
Security Documents or the other Loan Documents which may be necessary to perfect
and maintain perfected the security interest in and liens upon the Collateral
granted pursuant to the Security Documents and the other Loan Documents. Each
Secured Party agrees that it shall have recourse under or by virtue of the
Security Documents to the Collateral only through the Collateral Agent, that it
shall have no independent recourse to the Liens created by the Security
Documents and that it shall refrain from exercising any rights or remedies under
the Security Documents which have or may have arisen or which may arise as a
result of an Event of Default or an acceleration of the maturities of the
Obligations, except that, any Secured Party (i) may give directions to the
Collateral Agent as one of the Required Lenders, and (ii) may, to the extent
permitted by law or under any Loan Document, set off any amount of any balances
held by it for the account of any Company or any other property held or owing by
it to or for the credit or for the account of any Company provided, however,
that to the extent the amount so set off is to be applied to any of the
Obligations held by such Secured Party, such amount shall be delivered by such
Secured Party to the Collateral Agent for application pursuant to this
Agreement.

         (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) above, each Lender shall have the
right, with prior notice to Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, but
without the approval or consent of Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
the other Lenders, with respect to any Specified Hedging Agreement of such
Lender, (i) to declare an event of default, termination event or other similar
event thereunder and to create an early termination date, (ii) to determine net
termination amounts in accordance with the terms of such Specified Hedging
Agreement and to set-off amounts between Specified Hedging Agreement, and (iii)
in the absence of acceleration of all the Obligations under Article VIII, to
prosecute any legal action against the applicable Company to enforce net amounts
owing to such Lender under the Specified Hedging Agreement.

         (e) The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may perform any
of their duties hereunder by or through its agents or employees and each may,
from time to time, agree to reallocate or temporarily assign its rights and
responsibilities hereunder to the other.

                                      138
<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.02 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT IN THEIR
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity
as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, as applicable, and such Person
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder or Collateral
Agent, as applicable.

         SECTION 10.03 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing (except for the Collateral Agent in its
capacity as trustee for the Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral which
is the subject of Security Documents governed by English law), (b) the
Administrative Agent the Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is required to
exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 11.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information
relating to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or
obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent , as
applicable, or any of its respective Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action
taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as expressly provided in this Agreement) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default
unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent by Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or
inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report
or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent, as applicable.

         SECTION 10.04 RELIANCE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL
AGENT. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice,
request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper
Person. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent also may rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper

                                      139
<PAGE>

Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected
by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in
accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         SECTION 10.05 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and
powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable. The Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent and any such respective sub-agent may perform any and all its
duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Affiliates.
The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such
sub-agent and to the Affiliates of each Administrative Agent and Collateral
Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as
well as activities of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent.

         SECTION 10.06 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND/OR COLLATERAL AGENT.
The Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent may resign as such at any time
upon at least 20 days' prior notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and
Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right,
in consultation with Borrower, to appoint a successor from among the Lenders;
provided, however, that if the resigning Administrative Agent is UBS, the
successor Administrative Bank shall be Merrill and if the resigning Collateral
Agent is Merrill, the successor Collateral Bank shall be UBS. If no successor
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent and/or
Collateral Agent, as applicable, gives notice of its resignation, then the
retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable may, on
behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, which successor shall be a
commercial banking institution organized under the laws of the United States (or
any state thereof) or a United States branch or agency of a commercial banking
institution, and having combined capital and surplus of at least $250.0 million;
provided, however, that if such retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral
Agent, as applicable is unable to find a commercial banking institution which is
willing to accept such appointment and which meets the qualifications set forth
above, the retiring Administrative Agent's and/or Collateral Agent's resignation
shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and
perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent,
as applicable hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint
a successor Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable.

         Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent and/or
Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder by a successor, such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, and
the retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by
Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative
Agent's and/or Collateral Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
Article X and Section 11.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such

                                      140
<PAGE>

retiring Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, its
respective sub-agents and their respective Affiliates in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as
Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable.

         SECTION 10.07 NON-RELIANCE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE COLLATERAL
AGENT OR OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender
and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement
or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

         SECTION 10.08 NO OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR COLLATERAL AGENT. The
Lenders identified in this Agreement, the Syndication Agent and the
Documentation Agent shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Syndication Agent nor the
Documentation Agent shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship
with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect
to the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent as it makes with respect to
the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent or any other Lender in this Article
X. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that the
Documentation Agent and the Syndication Agent hold such titles in name only, and
that such titles confer no additional rights or obligations relative to those
conferred on any Lender hereunder.

         SECTION 10.09 INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders severally agree to indemnify
each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower
or the Guarantors and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower or the
Guarantors to do so), ratably according to their respective outstanding Loans
and Commitments in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under
this Section 10.09 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which
all Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in
full, ratably in accordance with such outstanding Loans and Commitments as in
effect immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
(whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the
Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 10.09 shall survive the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

                                      141
<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.10 OVERADVANCES. The Administrative Agent shall not make
(and shall prohibit the Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, as applicable, from
making) any Revolving Loans or provide any Letters of Credit to Borrower on
behalf of Lenders intentionally and with actual knowledge that such Revolving
Loans, Swingline Loans, or Letters of Credit would cause the aggregate amount of
the Revolving Exposure to exceed the Borrowing Base, without the prior consent
of all Lenders, except, that, the Administrative Agent (after consultation with
and consent of the Collateral Agent) may make (or cause to be made) such
additional Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans or provide such additional Letters
of Credit on behalf of Lenders, intentionally and with actual knowledge that
such Loans or Letters of Credit will cause (a) the total outstanding Revolving
Exposure to exceed the Borrowing Base, or (b) Excess Availability to be less
than $15.0 million, in each case as the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent may deem necessary or advisable in their collective discretion (each an
"OVERADVANCE" and collectively the "OVERADVANCES"), provided, that: (i) the
total principal amount of the Overadvances to Borrower which the Administrative
Agent may make or provide (or cause to be made or provided) after obtaining such
actual knowledge that the Revolving Exposure equals or exceeds the Borrowing
Base shall not exceed the amount equal to $20.0 million outstanding at any time
less the then outstanding amount of any Special Agent Advances and shall not
cause the Revolving Exposure to exceed the Revolving Commitments of all of the
Lenders or the Pro Rata Percentage of the Revolving Exposure of a Lender to
exceed such Lender's Revolving Commitment, (ii) without the consent of all
Lenders, (A) no Overadvance shall be outstanding for more than sixty (60) days
and (B) after all Overadvances have been repaid, the Administrative Agent shall
not make any additional Overadvance unless sixty (60) days or more have elapsed
since the last date on which any Overadvance was outstanding and (iii) the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such funds, on demand from
Borrower together with interest thereon for each day from the date such payment
was due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at the
interest rate provided for in Section 2.06(c). Each Lender shall be obligated to
pay the Administrative Agent the amount of its Pro Rata Percentage of any such
Overadvance provided, that the Administrative Agent is acting in accordance with
the terms of this Section 10.10. All Overadvances shall be secured by
Collateral.

         SECTION 10.11 SPECIAL AGENT ADVANCES. Administrative Agent (after
consultation with and consent of the Collateral Agent) may, at its option, from
time to time, at any time on or after an Event of Default and for so long as the
same is continuing or upon any other failure of a condition precedent to the
making of Loans hereunder, make such disbursements and advances ("SPECIAL AGENT
ADVANCES") which the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion after such
consultation with the Collateral Agent, deems necessary or desirable either (i)
to preserve or protect the Collateral or any portion thereof or (ii) to pay any
other amount chargeable to Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents consisting of costs, fees and expenses and
payments to any Issuing Bank (provided, that in no event shall (i) Special Agent
Advances for such purpose exceed the amount equal to $20.0 million in the
aggregate outstanding at any time less the then outstanding Overadvances under
Section 10.10 hereof and (ii) Special Agent Advances plus the Revolving Exposure
exceed the Lenders' Commitment at the time of such Event of Default or cause any
Lender's Revolving Exposure to exceed such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment at
the time of such Event of Default). Special Agent Advances shall be repayable on
demand and be secured by the Collateral. Special Agent Advances shall not
constitute Loans but shall otherwise constitute

                                      142
<PAGE>

Obligations hereunder. Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender and
Borrower in writing of each such Special Agent Advance, which notice shall
include a description of the purpose of such Special Agent Advance. Each Lender
agrees that it shall make available to Administrative Agent, upon Administrative
Agent's demand, in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such
Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each such Special Agent Advance. If such funds
are not made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender, Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover such funds, on demand from such Lender
together with interest thereon for each day from the date such payment was due
until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds
Rate for each day during such period (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York or at Administrative Agent's option based on the arithmetic mean
determined by Administrative Agent of the rates for the last transaction in
overnight Federal funds arranged prior to 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on that
day by each of the three leading brokers of Federal funds transactions in New
York City selected by Administrative Agent) and if such amounts are not paid
within three (3) days of Administrative Agent's demand, at the highest interest
rate provided for in Section 2.06(a).

         (d) if to a Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number) set forth

All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance

<PAGE>

accordance with this Section 11.01 and failure to deliver courtesy copies of
notices and other communications shall in no event affect the validity or
effectiveness of such notices and other communications.

         SECTION 11.02 WAIVERS; AMENDMENT; RELEASES OF COLLATERAL. (a) No
failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section 11.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default
at the time.

         (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other
Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by
the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the Loan Party
or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the written consent
of the Required Lenders; provided, that no such agreement shall (i) increase the
Dollar amount of the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of
such Lender or increase the commitments of all Lenders without the consent of
each Lender, (ii) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or LC
Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon or amend Annex I or the
definition of "Applicable Margin" (other than to waive default interest under
Section 2.06(c) to the extent a waiver of the underlying default giving rise to
such default interest does not require a vote of all Lenders), or reduce or
forgive any Fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or the required date
of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any
interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any
such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond the
Maturity Date, or postpone any prepayment or cash collateralization required
under Section 2.10(b), without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iv) change Section 2.14(b), (c) or Section 9.05 in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments or set-offs required thereby, without the
written consent of each Lender, (v) change Section 2.02(a) or (f) or any other
Section of this Agreement in a manner that would alter the pro rata allocation
among the Lenders of Loan or L/C Disbursements without the written consent of
each Lender, (vi) change the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required
Lenders", "Supermajority Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document
(including this Section 11.02) specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
(or Lenders of any

                                      145
<PAGE>

Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (vii) release
Holdings or any Guarantor from its Guarantee (except as expressly provided in
Article VII), or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the
written consent of each Lender, (viii) release all or substantially all of the
Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents (including pursuant to any
Permitted Fixed Asset Exchange or Permitted Asset Sale) or alter the relative
priorities of the Obligations entitled to the Liens of the Security Documents
(except in connection with securing additional Obligations equally and ratably
with the other Obligations), in each case without the written consent of each
Lender, or (ix) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by
its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders
holding Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other
Class, without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of
the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided,
further, that (1) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender, as the case may be, and (2) any waiver, amendment or modification of
this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this
Agreement of the Revolving Lenders may be effected by an agreement or agreements
in writing entered into by Borrower and requisite percentage in interest of the
affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this
Section 11.02(b) if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders
hereunder at the time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by Borrower,
the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (and, if
their rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Bank and the
Swingline Lender) if (x) by the terms of such agreement the Commitment of each
Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon
the effectiveness of such amendment and (y) at the time such amendment becomes
effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the
principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts
owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.

         (c) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination of the provisions of this Agreement that requires unanimous approval
of all Lenders as contemplated by Section 11.02(b) (other than clause (iii) of
such Section), the consent of the Supermajority Lenders is obtained but the
consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not
obtained, then Borrower shall have the right to replace all, but not less than
all, of such non-consenting Lender or Lenders (so long as all non-consenting
Lenders are so replaced) with one or more Persons pursuant to Section 2.16 so
long as at the time of such replacement each such new Lender consents to the
proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination; provided, however, that
Borrower shall not have the right to replace a Lender solely as a result of the
exercise of such Lender's rights (and the withholding of any required consent by
such Lender) pursuant to paragraph (iii) of Section 11.02(b); provided, further,
that concurrently with the effectiveness of its replacement, each replaced
Lender receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each
Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account
under this Agreement as in effect immediately prior to such replacement.

                                      146
<PAGE>

         (d) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement or
any Loan Document, if a "secured creditor" (as that term is defined under the
BIA) is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction not to include a Person
to whom obligations are owed on a joint or joint and several basis, then the
Canadian Loan Parties' Obligations (and the Obligations of its Subsidiaries), to
the extent such Obligations are secured, only shall be several obligations and
not joint or joint and several obligations.

         (e) Without the consent of the Supermajority Lenders, the Collateral
Agent shall not execute any releases of the Liens created by Security Documents
with respect to Collateral having an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of
$15.0 million in any fiscal year of the Borrower except for releases in
connection with Permitted Fixed Asset Exchanges, Permitted Asset Sales, or the
disposition of any Property by Borrower or any Borrowing Base Guarantor (or by
the Collateral Agent in connection with an enforcement of such Liens), as
otherwise permitted under this Agreement.

         SECTION 11.03 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY. (a) Borrower and Holdings agree,
jointly and severally, to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
but not limited to expenses incurred in connection with due diligence and
travel, courier, reproduction, printing and delivery expenses) incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing
Bank in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for
herein and the preparation, execution and delivery, and administration of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including any Inventory Appraisal, or in
connection with any amendments, modifications, enforcement costs, work-out
costs, documentary taxes or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether
or not the transactions hereby or thereby contemplated shall be consummated) or
incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in
connection with the work-out enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 9.02 of this
Agreement) and the other Loan Documents or in connection with the Loans made or
Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including the fees, charges and
disbursements of Latham & Watkins, counsel for the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent, and, in connection with any such enforcement or protection, or
work-out, the fees, charges and disbursements of any other counsel for the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender.

         (b) The Loan Parties agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Lender, the Issuing Bank and
the Swingline Lender, each Affiliate of any of the foregoing Persons and each of
their respective directors, officers, trustees, employees and agents (each such
Person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and to hold each Indemnitee
harmless from, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel
fees, charges, expenses and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the
Transactions, (ii) any actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans or
issuance of Letters of Credit, (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a
party thereto, or (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release or threatened
Release of Hazardous Materials, on, under or from any Property owned, leased or
operated by any Company, or any Environmental Claim related in any way to any
Company; provided, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related

                                      147
<PAGE>

expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee.

         (c) The provisions of this Section 11.03 shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the expiration
of any Letter of Credit, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 11.03 shall be
payable on written demand therefor accompanied by reasonable documentation with
respect to any reimbursement, indemnification or other amount requested.

         (d) To the extent that Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be
paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank
or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 11.03, each
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such
Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided, that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against any of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank
or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's
"pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the
total Revolving Exposure and unused Commitments at the time.

         SECTION 11.04 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that
issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
the Affiliates of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

         (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more banks, insurance companies,
investment companies or funds or other institutions (other than Borrower,
Holdings or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof) all or a portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided, that (i) except in
the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or a Lender
Affiliate, Borrower (except (i) after the occurrence and during the continuation
of a Default or Event of Default or (ii) prior to the completion of the primary
syndication (as determined by Arrangers) of the Commitments and the Loans by the
Arrangers) and the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an assignment of
all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or any Lender's obligations in
respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the Issuing Bank and the
Swingline

                                      148
<PAGE>

Lender) must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, any
assignment made in connection with the primary syndication of the Commitment and
Loans by the Arrangers or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender's Commitments or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans
of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than in the case of Revolving
Commitments and Revolving Loans, $5.0 million unless each of Borrower and the
Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be
made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this clause (iii) shall
not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments
or Loans, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire; and provided, further that any consent of Borrower otherwise
required under this paragraph shall not be required if a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section 11.04(b), from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement (provided, that any liability of Borrower to such assignee
under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15 shall be limited to the amount, if any, that
would have been payable thereunder by Borrower in the absence of such
assignment, except to the extent any such amounts are attributable to a Change
in Law occurring after the date of such assignment), and the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12,
2.13, 2.15 and 11.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of
this Section 11.04.

         (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error, and Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline
Lender and any Lender (with respect to its own interest only), at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                                      149
<PAGE>

         (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section 11.04 and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section 11.04, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

         (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or
more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided, that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided, that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 11.02(b) that affects such
Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section 11.04, Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13
and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 11.04. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender; provided, that such Participant agrees
to be subject to Section 2.14(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender shall,
acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain at one of its
offices a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of its
Participants, and the amount and terms of its participations, provided, that no
Lender shall be required to disclose or share the information contained in such
register with the Borrower or any other party, except as required by applicable
law.

         (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the prior
written consent of Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall
not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless Borrower is notified of
the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of Borrower, to comply with Sections 2.15(e) and (f) as though it were a
Lender.

         (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 11.04 shall not apply to any such pledge
or assignment of a security interest; provided, that no such pledge or

                                      150
<PAGE>

assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank
loans, such Lender may, without the consent of Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, collaterally assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement, including the Loans and Notes or any other instrument evidencing its
rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to any holder of, trustee for, or any
other representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued, by
such fund, as security for such obligations or securities; provided, that the
documentation governing or evidencing such collateral assignment or pledge shall
provide that any foreclosure or similar action by such trustee or representative
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 11.04 concerning assignments
and shall not be effective to transfer any rights under this Agreement or in any
Loan, Note or other instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under this
Agreement unless the requirements of Section 11.04 concerning assignments are
fully satisfied.

         SECTION 11.05 SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice
or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time
any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 and 11.03 and Article
X shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         SECTION 11.06 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other
Loan Documents and the Fee Letter constitute the entire contract among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         SECTION 11.07 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the

                                      151
<PAGE>

extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 11.08 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates are hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final, but excluding trust and payroll accounts) at any
time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to
or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by
such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender under this Section 11.08 are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

         SECTION 11.09 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF
PROCESS. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law
principles that would require the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction.

         (b) Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its Property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any
Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may
otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document against any Loan Party or its properties in the courts
of any jurisdiction.

         (c) Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 11.09. Each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in any such court.

         (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

                                      152

         SECTION 11.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each party hereto hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in any legal proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory). Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 11.10.

         SECTION 11.11 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         SECTION 11.12 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates or its Lender Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential pursuant to the terms hereof),
(b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal
process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the
exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder
or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially
the same as those of this Section 11.12, to (i) any assignee of or Participant
in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty
(or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to Borrower and
its obligations, (g) with the consent of Borrower or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) is publicly available at the time of disclosure or becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.12 or
(ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than
Borrower or any Subsidiary. For the purposes of this Section 11.12,
"Information" means all information received from Borrower or any Subsidiary
relating to Borrower or any Subsidiary or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower or any
Subsidiary; provided, that, in the case of information received from Borrower or
any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at
the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.12 shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other
written or oral understanding or agreement to which the parties hereto are
parties or by which they are bound, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
any obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein do not apply and
have not applied from the commencement of discussions between the parties to the
tax treatment and tax structure of the

                                      153
<PAGE>

Transactions (and any related transactions or arrangements), and (ii) each party
(and each of its employees, representatives, or other agents) may disclose to
any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax
structure of the Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure, all within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4; provided, however, that each party recognizes that the
privilege each has to maintain, in its sole discretion, the confidentiality of a
communication relating to the Transaction, including a confidential
communication with its attorney or a confidential communication with a federally
authorized tax practitioner under Section 7525 of the Code, is not intended to
be affected by the foregoing.

         SECTION 11.13 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the "CHARGES"), shall exceed
the maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section 11.13 shall be cumulated and the
interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods
shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such
cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective
Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

         SECTION 11.14 LENDER ADDENDUM. Each Lender to become a party to this
Agreement on the date hereof shall do so by delivering to the Administrative
Agent a Lender Addendum duly executed by such Lender, the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 11.15 DOLLAR EQUIVALENT CALCULATIONS. For purposes of this
Agreement, all valuations or computations of monetary amounts set forth in this
Agreement or the Loan Documents shall include as the context may require the
Dollar Equivalent of amounts of Canadian Dollars and, in any event, valuation of
assets included in the Borrowing Base which are in Canadian Dollars shall be
converted to Dollar Equivalent of such amounts for the purpose of calculating
the Borrowing Base on each date that a Borrowing Base Certificate is delivered
hereunder and at such other times as designated by the Administrative Agent.
Such Dollar Equivalent shall remain in effect until the same is recalculated by
the Administrative Agent as provided above and notice of such recalculation is
received by the Borrower, it being understood that until such notice of such
recalculation is received, the Dollar Equivalent shall be that Dollar Equivalent
as last reported to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each such
determination of the Dollar Equivalent.

         SECTION 11.16 JUDGMENT CURRENCY. (a) The Borrower's obligation
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in Dollars
(pursuant to such obligation, the "OBLIGATION CURRENCY") shall not be discharged
or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or
converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency,

                                      154
<PAGE>

except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective
receipt by the Administrative Agent or the respective Lender of the full amount
of the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent
or such Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If, for the
purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Borrower in any court or
in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency
other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter
referred to as the "JUDGMENT CURRENCY") an amount due in the Obligation
Currency, the conversion shall be made at the Dollar Equivalent, and in the case
of other currencies, the rate of exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent
or if the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such
currency, by a known dealer in such currency designated by the Administrative
Agent) determined, in each case, as of the Business Day immediately preceding
the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter
referred to as the "JUDGMENT CURRENCY CONVERSION DATE").

         (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the
Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount
due, the Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, such
additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount) as may be
necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial
award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.

         (c) For purposes of determining the Dollar Equivalent or any other rate
of exchange for this Section 11.16, such amounts shall include any premium and
costs payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.
